FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on August 28, 2014. On 
November 30, 2015, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under 
Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006. The adjudicative guidelines are 
codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006), and they replace the guidelines in 
Enclosure 2 to the Directive. 
 
 Applicant answered the SOR in an undated document and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April 14, 
 
2 
 
2016, and the case was assigned to me on May 2, 2016. On May 12, 2016, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was 
scheduled for June 6, 2016. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits 
(GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, 
presented the testimony of one witness, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A and 
B, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 
13, 2016. 
 
I kept the record open until July 11, 2016, to enable Applicant to submit 
additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX C through G, which were 
admitted without objection. When he submitted AX C through G, he indicated that 
additional evidence was forthcoming. I subsequently extended the deadline for 
submitting additional evidence to September 6, 2016, but he did not submit any 
additional evidence.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 
1.j. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.m. He stated that he was “not sure” 
about SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k, and 1.l. He did not admit or deny SOR ¶ 1.n. I have 
treated his responses as denials of SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.i and 1.k-1.n. His admissions in his 
answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 51-year-old senior security engineer employed by defense 
contractors since March 2014. He previously worked for defense contractors from July 
1996 to November 2000 and from April 2002 to March 2014. He has held a security 
clearance since May 2007. 
 
 Applicant graduated from college in December 1989 with a bachelor’s degree. 
He is in a master’s degree program and needs about 35 credits to complete it. (Tr. 40.)  
He married in March 1995. His wife passed away in October 2015. He has two sons, 
ages 26 and 20, who live with him.  
 
 Applicant’s wife was employed by an investment firm until she began having 
pulmonary problems in 1998 and was unable to continue working. She began receiving 
disability pay, which was about half of her previous salary. In 2004, she was diagnosed 
with severe sarcoidosis that required a double lung transplant, which was completed in 
2005. Although Applicant had medical insurance, he incurred uninsured expenses, 
especially in post-transplant care and medications. His wife was hospitalized for a 
month. The surgery and post-transplant care were performed at a specialized medical 
facility that was a considerable distance from their home. Applicant’s wife needed to 
rent an apartment near the hospital for about three and a half months of daily medical 
appointments.  
                                                          
1 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless 
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. 
 
3 
 
 Applicant’s father passed away in August 2005, and his mother passed away in 
February 2006. He incurred unexpected expenses to attend their funerals and resolve 
their estates. (Answer to SOR.) 
 
In January 2010, Applicant’s wife was diagnosed with cancer. She was 
hospitalized until May 2010, and received frequent follow-up treatment until 2012, 
causing them to incur additional uninsured medical expenses and transportation 
expenses. Applicant took periods of leave without pay to care for his wife until she 
recovered. Her health continued to slowly decline until she passed away in October 
2015. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 33-36.)  
 
Applicant estimated that he had out-of-pocket expenses of $15,000 to $20,000 
per year from April 2004 until his wife passed away in 2015. (Tr. 49-51.) His credit 
bureau report (CBR) from January 2007 reflected 40 judgments entered against him 
between 2001 and 2006, many of them for medical debts. Twenty judgments were listed 
as satisfied, one was listed as appealed, and the status of 19 was listed as unknown. 
(GX 2 at 4-12.) The judgments are not reflected in his subsequent CBRs and are not 
alleged in the SOR. 
 
 The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to pay his federal taxes for “at least” tax 
years 2008 and 2009, and that a federal tax lien for about $18,241 was filed against him 
in 2012 and remains unpaid. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b). He testified that he and his wife did 
not file tax returns for tax years 2005 to 2008. Their failures to file returns and pay the 
taxes due resulted in several tax liens being filed against them.2 (Tr. 58.) Applicant’s 
CBRs from September 2014, March 2015, and November 2015 reflected the tax lien 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b as well as two other tax liens for $13,358 and $72,981 that were 
satisfied in June 2013 and May 2014. (GX 3 at 4; GX 4 at 4; GX 5 at 1-2.) In 2012, 
Applicant made an installment payment agreement with the IRS to pay the delinquent 
taxes for 2008 at the rate of $218 per month, and he has made the payments as 
agreed. As of May 18, 2016, he owed $5,873 for 2008. (Tr. 59; AX A; AX C.) 
 
 In addition to Applicant’s federal tax debt, the SOR alleges 12 other delinquent 
debts, which are reflected in his CBRs from January 2007 (GX 2), September 2014 (GX 
3), March 2015 (GX 4), and November 2015 (GX 5.) The status of these debts is set out 
below. 
                                                          
2 The judgments reflected in Applicant’s January 2007 CBR and his failures to timely file his tax returns 
for tax years 2005 to 2008 are not alleged in the SOR and may not be an independent basis for revoking 
his security clearance. However, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an 
applicant=s credibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate 
evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has 
demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 
at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered the judgments and his failures to timely file his tax 
returns for these limited purposes.

 SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.n, cable service bill ($113-$116). SOR ¶ 1.c alleges the 
original creditor and SOR ¶ 1.n alleges the collection agency for the same debt. In 
Applicant’s answer to the SOR and at the hearing, he stated that he was a current 
customer of the cable company and that he paid his bill every month. He testified that 
he did not know why the debt was listed on his CBRs as delinquent, but he had not 
contacted the creditor or the credit bureaus to dispute the information in the CBR. (Tr. 
59-60.) His November 2015 CBR reflects that the account became delinquent in June 
2009. (GX 5 at 2.) After the hearing, he submitted his June 2016 bill from the cable 
company, and it reflects a past due amount of $95.93. (AX D.) The debt is not resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d, delinquent rent bill ($155). In his answer to the SOR, Applicant 
stated that he was “not sure” about this debt. His November 2015 CBR reflected that 
the account became delinquent in December 2013. (GX 5 at 2.) At the hearing, he 
testified that the debt was incurred for his son’s lodging at college, that it had been 
resolved, and that he could provide documentation showing it was resolved. (Tr. 60.) 
However, he did not submit any documentation to support his testimony.  
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f, medical bills ($55 and $92). In his response to the SOR 
and at the hearing, Applicant stated that these bills were from his doctor and had been 
paid in full. (Tr. 60.) They are unrelated to his wife’s medical problems. He did not 
provide any evidence of the circumstances under which he incurred these debts. His 
November 2015 CBR reflected them as having become delinquent in August and 
December 2013 and as unpaid. (GX 5 at 2.) After the hearing, he submitted evidence 
that the bills were paid on July 11, 2016, the deadline set at the hearing for submitting 
additional evidence. (AX E; AX F.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g, collection account ($190). In his answer to the SOR, Applicant 
stated that he was “not sure” about this debt. His March 2015 CBR reflected that the 
date of last activity on this account was in October 2009. (GX 4 at 2.) At the hearing, he 
testified that contacted the creditor by telephone about three months before the hearing, 
but that he had not received a response. (Tr. 60, 62.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h, telephone bill ($60). In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, 
Applicant stated that this debt had been paid and that he was a current customer of this 
provider. (Tr. 60.) His November 2015 CBR reflected that the debt first became 
delinquent in April 2009 and that the account was closed by the provider. (GX 5 at 5.) 
After the hearing, he provided evidence of a $251 payment to this creditor on July 11, 
2016, the deadline set at the hearing for additional evidence. (AX G.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.i, collection account ($554). In his answer to the SOR, Applicant 
stated that he was “not sure” about this debt. His September 2014 CBR reflected that a 
bank was the original creditor, the date of last activity was in October 2008, and it was 
referred for collection in November 2013. (GX 3 at 9.) At the hearing, Applicant testified 
that he contacted the collection agency about three months before the hearing, and the 
agency had responded, but he had not taken any further action. He did not state what, if 
 
5 
 
anything, the collection agency offered. (Tr. 62-63.) He did not provide any 
documentation regarding the status of this debt. It is unresolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.j, student loan past due for $561. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant 
admitted this debt and stated that he had made arrangements to pay it on March 22 and 
April 7, 2016. (Tr. 64.) After the hearing, he submitted evidence of a $197 payment on 
March 23, 2016, but no evidence of an April payment. (AX C.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.k, charged-off loan for a time-share property ($15,661). Applicant’s 
September 2014 CBR reflected that this debt was charged off in September 2010. In his 
answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted this debt and promised to reach out to the 
creditor and arrange to pay it. At the hearing, he testified that he had contacted the 
creditor about three months before the hearing, but he had not received a response. (Tr. 
65.) The debt is not resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.l, collection account ($451). In his answer to the SOR, Applicant 
stated he was “not sure” about this debt. His September 2014 CBR reflected that the 
debt was referred for collection in May 2010. (GX 3 at 9.) As of the date of the hearing, 
he had not attempted to contact the creditor or dispute the debt. (Tr. 67.)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.m, traffic ticket ($250). In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated he 
was “not sure” about this debt. His September 2014 CBR reflected that it was referred 
for collection in April 2012. (GX 3 at 9.) At the hearing, he testified that it had been paid 
and he had proof of payment. (Tr. 67.) He did not submit any documentation to support 
his testimony. 
 
 A friend who has worked with Applicant in media technology for their church for 
more than ten years submitted a letter describing him as a team player, devoted 
husband and father, and a skilled technician. (AX B.) Applicant’s security officer, who 
retired from the Navy after 21 years of service and has worked for the Navy as a civilian 
since 1999, has known Applicant since around 1998. They attend the same church and 
have become good friends. He described Applicant as a “stand-up guy,” deeply 
religious, devoted to his family, and trying to meet his financial obligations. (Tr. 22-28.) 
 
 Applicant was earning about $90,000 per year until September 2015, when he 
changed jobs and began earning about $130,000 per year. (Tr. 44-46.) His net monthly 
income is about $7,000, his expenses and debt payments (including payments to the 
IRS) total about $5,312, and he has a net monthly remainder of about $1,788. (Tr. 70-
76.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
 
6 
 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 The evidence indicates that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.n are 
duplicates. The creditor alleged in SOR ¶ 1.n is the collection agency for the original 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.a. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same 
guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See 
ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). 
Accordingly, I have resolved SOR ¶ 1.n in Applicant’s favor. 
 
 Applicant’s admissions, corroborated by the CBRs, establish two disqualifying 
conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”) 
and AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”). The disqualifying 
condition in AG ¶ 19(g) (“failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns 
as required or the fraudulent filing of the same”) is not applicable because his failures to 
timely file tax returns was not alleged in the SOR.  
 
 The following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
8 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is partially established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous, 
and recent. However, the tax debt in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, and the consumer and 
medical debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.n were incurred and 
became delinquent under unusual circumstances making them unlikely to recur. 
Applicant’s wife was battling serious medical problems, he and his wife were under 
physical and mental stress, and they were incurring substantial medical expenses and 
other incidental expenses related to her medical treatment. However, the debts alleged 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.f, 1.j, and 1.m were unrelated to her illness and medical treatment. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is partially established. The illness of Applicant’s wife and the 
expenses related to it were circumstances largely beyond his control. However, the 
medical debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f were for Applicant’s medical care and 
unrelated to his wife’s illness. He did not provide any evidence showing whether his 
medical debts were for routine medical care or emergencies beyond his control. He 
acted responsibly regarding his federal tax debt by contacting the IRS, entering into a 
payment agreement in 2012, and making the payments as agreed. He has not acted 
responsibly regarding his other debts. His wife’s cancer treatment ended in 2012. His 
income dramatically increased when he began a new job in September 2015. He 
claimed that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, and 1.n were resolved, but he submitted no 
documentation to support his claims. He has not contacted the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.l. He 
testified that he had a payment agreement for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.j and he provided 
proof of one payment, but no proof any subsequent payments. He did not contact the 
creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.i, and 1.k until three months before the hearing, well after he 
received the SOR. He did not pay the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h until after the 
hearing. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not received financial counseling, 
and many of his delinquent debts remain unresolved.  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) is established for SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, but not for the other delinquent 
debts. This guideline requires a showing of good faith. Good faith means acting in a way 
that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. 
ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Evidence of 
past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of 
 
9 
 
qualifying for a security clearance. The evidence set out in the above discussion of AG 
¶ 20(b), indicates that Applicant made one payment of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.j and paid 
the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h to protect his security clearance, not because of a 
sense of obligation. The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k, and 1.l are not resolved. The 
adjudicative guidelines do not require that Applicant resolve all the debts in the SOR, 
but they do require that he have a coherent, credible plan for resolving them and take 
substantial steps to implement it. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 
21, 2008). Applicant’s last-minute resolution of a few debts and failure to document his 
claims that other debts have been resolved fall short of establishing a good-faith effort 
to resolve his financial problems. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(e) is not established. Although he was unsure of the status of several 
debts, he has not disputed any of them with the original creditors, the collection 
agencies, or the credit bureaus. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant has worked for defense contractors and held a security clearance for 
many years, apparently without incident. He went through a period of serious physical, 
emotional, and financial stress from 2004 to 2015. He resolved many of the medical 
debts reflected in his January 2007 SCA. On the other hand, he submitted his most 
recent SCA more than three years ago and was aware that his delinquent debts were a 
security concern. He received a significant pay increase two years ago, and he now has 
a substantial monthly remainder, but he did not take his financial situation seriously until 
he realized that his security clearance was in jeopardy.  
 
10 
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. Accordingly, I 
conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:    For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.c-1.m:    Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.n:     For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied.
