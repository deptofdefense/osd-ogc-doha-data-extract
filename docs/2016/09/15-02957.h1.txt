HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant did not provide enough evidence of her payment history on her student 
loans. She paid one $498 debt that was alleged on her statement of reasons (SOR). 
She said she disputed other debts; however, she did not provide documentary evidence 
of those disputes. Her financial records do not establish her financial responsibility. 
Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Access to classified 
information is denied.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On May 3, 2013, Applicant completed and signed her Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) 
On November 16, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
   
 
2 
 
 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). 
 
On December 15, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) On March 31, 
2016, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On May 24, 2016, the case was 
assigned to me. On June 6, 2016, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for June 22, 2016. (HE 1) Applicant 
waived her right under the Directive to 15 days of notice of the date, time, and location 
of her hearing. (Tr. 13-14) Her hearing was held as scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits, which were 
admitted without objection, and Applicant did not offer any exhibits. (Tr. 17; Government 
Exhibit (GE) 1-6) On June 30, 2016, DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the 
hearing. The record was held open for additional evidence until July 26, 2016. (Tr. 74-
75, 77) On July 26, 2016, five post-hearing documents were received and admitted 
without objection. (AE A-E) The record was held open until September 6, 2016 to permit 
Applicant to submit additional documentation. (HE 4) No documentation was submitted 
after July 26, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, she disputed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a; she claimed 
that she paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.f, and 1.h, and she averred that she was 
working on arranging payments to the other SOR creditors. She also provided 
extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings 
of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 35-year-old executive assistant, who has worked for various 
federal contractors since 2008. (Tr. 5, 8; GE 1) In 1999, she graduated from high 
school. (Tr. 5) In 2003, she received a bachelor’s degree. (Tr. 6, 18-19) She has not 
served in the military. (Tr. 6; GE 1) She has not married, and she has a three-year-old 
daughter. (Tr. 6) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Student Loans 
 
 Applicant’s SOR alleges three student loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f totaling 
$42,729. Applicant acknowledged that she was delinquent on her student loans from 
2004 to 2008, and during those years, her annual income was $35,000 to $45,000. (Tr. 
20-21) From 2008 to 2013, her salary increased from $65,000 to $80,000. (Tr. 21-22) 
During the 2008 to 2013 timeframe, Applicant said she completed the student loan 
rehabilitation program, and she was caught up on her student loans. (Tr. 22) In 2012, 
                                            
1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.  
   
 
3 
 
 
when her daughter was born with medical problems, she went on seven months of 
unpaid leave, and her student loans again became delinquent. (Tr. 23-24) In February 
2013, she returned to employment at an annual salary of $85,000. (Tr. 25-26) Her 
current annual salary is $90,000. (Tr. 26) Applicant’s monthly daycare bill is $1,100, and 
she gives her mother $800 monthly. (Tr. 44)  
 
 Applicant believed she borrowed about $20,000 in student loans. (Tr. 26) 
Applicant’s October 13, 2015 Equifax credit report shows the two student loan debts in 
SOR ¶ 1.c for $10,949 and SOR ¶ 1.d for $8,192 as transfers from another student loan 
creditor (GE 2). The student loan in SOR ¶ 1.f for $26,341 is not shown in her October 
13, 2015 Equifax credit report. (GE 2) 
 
 Applicant’s March 6, 2015 Equifax credit report shows one past-due student loan 
account with a past due balance of $10,784, and the comments indicate the debt is 
being assigned to the government. (GE 3) The other student loan debts show a zero 
balance, zero past due amount, and the comments indicate the debts were assigned to 
the government. (GE 3) Other student loan debts are shown as paid. (GE 3) 
 
 Applicant’s July 22, 2014 Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax combined credit 
report shows two student loans: one under Experian was past due in the amount of 
$22,846; one under Equifax was past due in the amount of $22,853; and they were both 
owed to the same creditor. This credit report supports the student loan debt in SOR ¶ 
1.f for $23,651. The July 22, 2014 combined credit report shows a variety of other 
student loan accounts, including the accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d.  
 
 Applicant said she fell behind on her student loans because she could not afford 
the payments and she conceded she was “being immature and not being responsible.” 
(Tr. 29) She said she was placed into another student loan rehabilitation program in 
October 2015. (Tr. 27-29) She believed she completed the student loan rehabilitation 
program in May 2016. (Tr. 30) She said she wanted the payments to be made 
automatically from her pay. (Tr. 30)  
 
Applicant provided a November 10, 2015 U.S. Government Wage Garnishment 
Order (SF-329B), which was submitted to her employer from the collection agent for the 
U.S. Department of Education seeking payment of a debt for $23,861. The garnishment 
order indicates her pay is scheduled to be debited $393 every two weeks, which is the 
maximum amount that may be garnished (15 percent of disposable pay). (Tr. 31; AE E) 
Applicant said all of her student loans were now current. (Tr. 32) In November 2015, her 
student loan balance was $23,861. (AE E) She believes that after six months of 
payments under the garnishment order her student loan accounts will be rehabilitated, 
and the garnishment will be lifted. (AE A)  
  
Other SOR Debts 
 
 Applicant’s non-student loan SOR debts total less than $3,000. The debt alleged 
in SOR ¶ 1.a for $1,366 resulted from her termination of a telecommunications contract. 
   
 
4 
 
 
(Tr. 32) She said she faxed the termination notice for her contract to the creditor on 
several occasions, and she contended that the telecommunications company did not 
service the area where her relative, who was receiving the benefit of the 
telecommunications contract lived. (Tr. 32-33) She said she faxed a dispute to the 
creditor; however, she did not provide a copy of the letter disputing her responsibility for 
this debt. (Tr. 33) Applicant’s October 13, 2015 Equifax credit report does not show the 
telecommunications debt in SOR ¶ 1.a. (GE 2) Applicant’s March 6, 2015 Equifax credit 
report shows the telecommunications account as a collection account for $1,458. (GE 3)  
 
 The medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.b for $66 resulted from a copay from the treatment 
of her daughter. (Tr. 33-34) Applicant’s March 6, 2015 Equifax credit report shows the 
medical debt for $66. (GE 3) Applicant said she paid this debt, and it does not appear 
on her October 13, 2015 Equifax credit report. (GE 2) A fair inference is that Applicant’s 
dispute was successful and caused the negative entry about the minor medical debt to 
be removed from her credit report.  
 
The credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.e for $498 is shown as delinquent in Applicant’s 
October 13, 2015 Equifax credit report. (GE 2) She made a $150 payment in January 
2016. (Tr. 37) On July 25, 2016, she paid the creditor $400, and the debt is resolved. 
(AE D) 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i allege Applicant received three tickets, which are owed 
to a government entity for $55 each. In her SOR response, Applicant said she paid the 
debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.h, and the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g will be paid by January 6, 2015. 
(HE 3) At her hearing, Applicant said in 2013, her vehicle was stolen, and it accrued 
three tickets in 2013. (Tr. 37-38; GE 4) Applicant said she disputes her responsibility for 
these three debts. (Tr. 37-40) Applicant claimed that she checked with the government 
entity, and the three tickets are not associated with her vehicle. (Tr. 39-40; SOR 
response) The three debts do not appear on her March 6, 2015 and October 13, 2015 
Equifax credit reports. (GE 2)  
 
On August 4, 2016, I emailed Applicant and asked her to provide: (1) an account 
statement showing her student loan payments; (2) correspondence showing she 
disputed the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i and the basis for her disputes; (3) an 
updated credit report from all three major credit reporting companies (Experian, Equifax, 
and TransUnion); and (4) performance evaluations. (HE 4) She asked for a delay until 
August 12, 2016. (HE 4) On August 28, 2016, I emailed Applicant and advised her that I 
had not received any documentation after July 26, 2016 from her, and I gave her an 
additional delay until September 6, 2016 to present her documentation. (HE 4) No 
documentation was received after July 26, 2016. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
   
 
5 
 
 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
   
 
6 
 
 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s history of 
delinquent debt is documented in her credit reports, SOR response, and hearing record. 
Applicant’s SOR alleges nine allegations of delinquent debts totaling $45,019. After 
deducting two duplicated student loan debts, her SOR alleges seven delinquent debts 
totaling $25,746. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions. 
  
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
  
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
   
 
7 
 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving her delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all of her SOR debts; however, she presented 
some important mitigating information. Several circumstances beyond her control 
adversely affected her finances: Applicant’s daughter had medical problems and 
Applicant needed to take off from work to care for her daughter; her daughter had 
medical bills; and early in her career, Applicant was underemployed. However, she did 
not provide enough specifics about how these circumstances adversely affected her 
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

finances, and she did not establish that she acted responsibly to address her delinquent 
debts after she returned to full employment in 2013.       
 
Applicant’s SOR includes three student loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.c ($10,949), 1.d 
($8,192), and 1.f ($23,651), and I accept Applicant’s statement as credible that SOR ¶¶ 
1.c and 1.d have been merged into SOR ¶ 1.f, and she now owes about $20,000 in 
student loans. Of course, Applicant loses some mitigating credit because her student 
loan is apparently being paid through garnishment of her pay.3 She is credited with 
mitigating SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d as duplications. She is not credited with mitigating SOR ¶ 
1.f because she did not provide a current summary of her payments to her student loan 
account. She did not show a history of her student loan accounts.  
 
Applicant is credited with mitigating the medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($66) and the 
medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($498).  
 
As for SOR debts ¶¶ 1.a, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i, she said she disputed her 
responsibility for paying them. However, she cannot be credited with mitigating them 
because she did not provide “documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute” 
or documentation showing her actions to resolve the issue under AG ¶ 20(e). She did 
not provide copies of letters to the SOR creditors and credit reporting companies 
disputing her responsibility for these four debts. 
 
Applicant cannot be credited with mitigating the debts that were dropped from her 
2015 Equifax credit report.4  More evidence of debt resolution is necessary.  
   
There is insufficient evidence about why she was unable to make greater 
documented progress resolving more of her SOR debts. There is insufficient assurance 
that her financial problems are being resolved, are under control, and will not recur in 
the future. Under all the circumstances, she failed to establish that financial 
considerations security concerns are mitigated. 
 
  
                                            
3Of course, Applicant loses some mitigating credit because some debt payments were made 
through garnishment of her salary. Payment of a debt “though garnishment rather than a voluntary effort 
diminishes its mitigating force.” Compare ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2010) with 
ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (payment of two of four debts through 
garnishment did not bar mitigation of financial considerations concerns). See also ISCR Case No. 14-
05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016); ISCR Case No. 09-05700 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011) (garnished 
payments towards delinquent tax debts is not mitigating information in light of other factors); ISCR Case 
No. 08-06058 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009) (remanding the case to the administrative judge and stating 
when addressing an Internal Revenue Service garnishment, “On its face, satisfaction of a debt through 
the involuntary establishment of a creditor’s garnishment is not the same as, or similar to, a good-faith 
initiation of repayment by the debtor.”).

off  his credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution” and citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 
3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015).

Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a 35-year-old executive assistant, who has worked for various 
federal contractors since 2008. In 2003, she received a bachelor’s degree. She has a 
three-year-old daughter. Circumstances beyond her control adversely affected her 
finances, including illness of her daughter, medical bills, underemployment, and leave 
without pay to care for her daughter. Over the years, her pay has substantially 
increased, which is a strong indication that she is a valued employee, who is making 
important contributions to her employer.     
 
Applicant is credited with mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. 
She is not credited with mitigating her other SOR debts because of the paucity of 
corroborating evidence that the debts were paid, are in an established payment plan, or 
are being reasonable disputed. She has not made sufficient progress resolving the SOR 
debts in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i.    
 
Applicant did not provide enough specifics about how circumstances beyond her 
control adversely affected her finances, and she did not show that she acted 
responsibly to address her delinquent debts. Her failure to make greater progress 
resolving her SOR debts shows lack of financial responsibility and judgment and raises 
unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified information. See AG ¶ 18. More documented financial progress is necessary 
to mitigate financial considerations security concerns.   
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
   
 
10 
 
 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to 
Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a 
determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for 
award of a security clearance in the future. With more effort towards documented 
resolution of her past-due debts, and a track record of behavior consistent with her 
obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security 
clearance worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. I conclude that financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. It is 
not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility at this time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraph 1.a:     Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.b through 1.e:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.f through 1.i:  Against Applicant 
    
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
