Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his eligibility for
access to classified information. The evidence is sufficient to explain and mitigate
Applicant’s history of financial problems and difficulties. Accordingly, this case is
decided for Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on June 18, 2012, for a periodic reinvestigation.  About three1
years later on July 27, 2015, after reviewing the application and information gathered
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).

during a background investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD)  sent Applicant a2
statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified
information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the3
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. He
answered the SOR on August 20, 2015, and requested a hearing.          
The case was assigned to me on February 22, 2016. The hearing was held as
scheduled on May 25, 2016. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1–8, and they were
admitted except for Exhibit 4.  Applicant testified on his own behalf and offered Exhibits4
A–M, and they were admitted. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on June
3, 2016.
The record was kept open for about 45 days until July 11, 2016, to allow
Applicant to submit documentation concerning a state tax lien.  His post-hearing5
documentation is admitted without objections as Exhibit N. 
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 54-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance
that he has held for many years as a servicemember and contractor. He graduated from
a U.S. military academy in 1984.  He then served on active military duty for about 126
years until 1996, when he was honorably discharged.  He worked in the fields of7
financial management, cost analysis, and acquisitions management. He went on to
serve reserve duty during 1999–2010, when he retired at the pay grade of 0-4, major.8
His educational background includes a master’s degree in finance awarded in 1995.  9

Since discharge from active duty in 1996, Applicant has worked as an operations
manager for the same company.  His annual gross salary is about $135,000, not10
including any bonus.  He will begin receiving military retired pay at age 60.  His first11 12
marriage ended in divorce in 1992. He married his current wife in 2000. She is
employed in the budget department of a public school district, and she earns about
$35,000 annually.13
Applicant has a history of financial problems and difficulties dating back to the
2005–2007 period. In his 2012 security clearance application, he disclosed a Chapter
13 bankruptcy case filed in 2005.  He stated that the case was concluded by paying off14
the debt early. He reported no other financial problems or delinquent accounts. 
Under Guideline F, the SOR allegations concern three items: (1) the Chapter 13
bankruptcy case, which was filed in July 2005 and dismissed in September 2007; (2) an
unpaid $100,491 judgment filed in July 2006 stemming from a mortgage loan on a rental
home; and (3) an unpaid $7,363 state tax lien filed in March 2013. The first two items
are interrelated and discussed together below.
Concerning the bankruptcy case, Applicant explained that he and his wife
concluded that they needed relief in addressing their indebtedness.  He had been15
dealing with increasing child-support payments and related expenses from his divorce
as well as a tenant who was not paying rent but still living in the rental home. The
primary debts at issue in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case were mortgage loans on
Applicant’s residential home and a rental home. A review of the Chapter 13 bankruptcy
court records shows that both homes were sold during the bankruptcy process, and the
sale proceeds were used to pay off the mortgage loans on the properties.  16
The judgment in the SOR stems from the bankruptcy court’s February 2, 2006
decision to allow the creditor to foreclose its mortgage on the rental property.  The July17
2006 judgment for $100,491 was the result of the foreclosure. The creditor bought the

rental home at a foreclosure sale in September 2006 conducted by a special master.18
Thereafter, the creditor sold the rental home to a new owner in January 2007.19
Although the unpaid 2006 judgment appears on the Government’s 2012 credit report,20
it does not appear on the Government’s credit reports from 2014 and 2015.  Likewise,21
the judgment does not appear on Applicant’s credit reports from 2013 and 2016.  22
The residential home was sold in about May 2007.  Once both homes were sold,23
Applicant, through counsel, moved the court to dismiss the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case,
because Applicant and his wife no longer wished to be debtors in bankruptcy.  The24
bankruptcy court dismissed the case in September 2007.  In addition to paying off the25
mortgage loans with the sales proceeds, the bankruptcy court records show Applicant
paid $50,718 into the confirmed Chapter 13 plan of which $39,286 was used to pay off
indebtedness.   26
Concerning the state tax lien for $7,363, it was not reported in Applicant’s 2012
security clearance application or discussed in his 2012 background investigation
because it occurred after those events.  It is established by multiple credit reports.  In27 28
addition, Applicant’s credit reports from 2013 and 2015 establish a second unpaid state
tax lien for $715, also filed in March 2013, and not alleged in the SOR.  In his answer29
to the SOR, he  stated that he did not realize there was a state tax lien against him; he
included a copy of an August 2015 letter of inquiry to the state tax department and a
copy of his state income tax return for 2013; and he pledged to work to clear the matter

up.  He sent another letter of inquiry in December 2015.  At the hearing, he expressed30 31
frustration with his inability to communicate with someone at the state tax department,
and he was uncertain of the basis for the tax lien.  Post-hearing, he presented32
documentation from the state tax department showing that both tax liens were
released.  33
Although Applicant has a formal education and background in finance, it was
apparent that he had a layman’s understanding of his bankruptcy case. He expressed
frustration with a lack of communication and information from his bankruptcy attorney.34
He described the bankruptcy case as a “black hole process.”  He confused or conflated35
the discharge of the bankruptcy trustee at the conclusion of the case with him and his
wife receiving a discharge, when in fact they had the case dismissed.36
Applicant is no longer financially overextended, and his overall financial situation
appears to be stable. The most recent credit report from March 2016 lists the two state
tax liens discussed above, which are now resolved. Otherwise, the report contains no
derogatory accounts (e.g., past-due accounts, collection accounts, or charged-off
accounts).  He and his wife have lived in a rental home since early 2007. He estimated37
their total monthly living expenses at about $4,000, which is relatively low compared
with household income.  He has an employer-sponsored pension plan valued at about38
$525,131 as of November 2015.  He estimated having about $1 million in total39
investment accounts.    40

Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As41
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt42
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An43
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  44
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting45
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An46
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate47
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  48
In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a
preponderance of the evidence.  The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s49
reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence
standard.50

financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In
security clearance cases, “the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances
surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation
omitted). 
 AG ¶ 18.  54

The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it51
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant52
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 53
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  54
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence—Applicant’s 2005–2007 Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, the
indebtedness therein, and the 2013 state tax liens—supports a conclusion that
Applicant has demonstrated an inability to satisfy debts within the meaning of AG ¶
19(a). The same facts support a conclusion of a history of not meeting financial
 AG ¶ 20(a)–(f).55
8
obligations within the meaning of AG ¶ 19(c). Those matters require closer examination.
Indeed, failure to pay taxes on a timely basis suggests that an applicant has a problem
with complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified
information.
I considered the six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and the following55
are most pertinent in analyzing Applicant’s case:
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
case doubt on the [person’s] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment; and 
AG ¶ 20(c) [t]here are clear indications that the problem is being resolved
or is under control. 
The former mitigating condition applies to the facts and circumstances
surrounding Applicant’s 2005–2007 Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, including the judgment
from foreclosure on the rental home. The bankruptcy case was largely the result of
Applicant becoming financially overextended for the reasons discussed above. The
mortgage loans were paid off when the homes were sold during the bankruptcy
process, he paid in more than $50,000 into the bankruptcy case, and the case was
dismissed in September 2007, which is now nine years ago. Moreover, Applicant is a
renter without the burden of a mortgage loan, which suggests that similar behavior is
unlikely to recur. 
The latter mitigating condition applies to all three items in the SOR. As noted
above, the bankruptcy case and related judgment are now safely in the past, nine years
removed. And Applicant has now resolved the state tax liens. Taken together, the facts
and circumstances show that his financial problems during 2005–2007 are becoming a
historical footnote in his life. But the same cannot be said for 2013 state tax liens. He
should have been more proactive in resolving the liens. Nevertheless, the liens are now
resolved as shown by the post-hearing documentation. It is also noted that the amount
of money at issue was not large. Moreover, it is evident that Applicant’s financial
condition has improved since the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, he has accumulated
substantial financial assets, and his overall financial situation is stable.    
In addition to considering the formal mitigating circumstances, I gave favorable
consideration to Applicant’s 20-plus years of honorable military service; his long record
of holding a security clearance; his long record of employment with the same company;
and his voluntarily reporting of the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in his security clearance
application. Taken together, these circumstances are a good indication of stability,
reliability, and trustworthiness.    
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).56
9
Applicant’s history of financial problems and difficulties does not create doubt
about his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect
classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice
versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I56
conclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified
information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.c: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
