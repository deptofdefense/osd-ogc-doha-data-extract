ISCR Case No. 14-05934
APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On
April 5, 2015, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision
on the written record.  On June 27, 2016, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings
and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Matthew E. Malone denied Applicant’s request for a
security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
The SOR alleged that Applicant had eight delinquent debts totaling about $20,000.  Six of
those debts were student loans totaling about $12,000.  The Judge found against Applicant on all the
debts. 
In the decision, the Judge noted that Applicant claimed in his SOR response that he was
paying the student loans and had resolved the two other debts. The Judge noted that Applicant did
not submit any corroborating evidence to support his claims.
In his appeal brief, Applicant presented documents that were not part of the record before
the Judge.  These documents constitute new evidence that the Board can neither receive nor
consider.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  Applicant has not shown that the Judge committed any harmful
error.  The Judge’s decision is sustainable on the record. 
Order
The Decision is AFFIRMED.
