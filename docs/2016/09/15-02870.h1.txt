GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 21, 2012, Applicant applied for a public trust position and 
submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On 
October 30, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to DOD 
Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended 
and modified (Regulation); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified 
(Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to 
Classified Information (effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all 
adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged 
trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed

reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to make an affirmative finding under 
the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or 
continue Applicant’s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract 
with the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 11, 2015. In a sworn 
statement, dated January 14, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On March 8, 2016, Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to 
me on March 23, 2016. A Notice of Hearing was issued on April 28, 2016. I convened 
the hearing, as scheduled, on May 18, 2016.  
 
 During the hearing, three Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 3), eight 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE H), and one administrative exhibit were admitted 
into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on 
June 1, 2016. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant 
failed to take advantage of that opportunity. The record closed on June 22, 2016. 
  
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.b. through 1.m.) of the SOR. Applicant’s 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a full-
time manager for a defense contractor since November 2012.2 He previously served as 
an operations manager with the same employer from October 1999 until February 2005, 
and in a variety of positions with other employers from October 2005 until November 
2012.3 He is seeking to retain his eligibility for occupying a public trust position to 
support a contract with the DOD. He is a 1993 high school graduate, and he received 
an associate’s degree in 2005 and a bachelor’s degree in May 2015.4 He served active 
duty with the U.S. Air Force from November 1994 until he was honorably discharged in

November 1998.5 Applicant was married in March 2011.6 He has one daughter, born in 
April 2011.7 
 
Financial Considerations8 
 
In early 2005, the company for which Applicant worked initiated a reduction in 
force, and, because Applicant did not possess a degree for his position, he was laid off 
and given a severance package. That package enabled him to take off for an entire year 
to return to school full-time to obtain his degree.9 It is unclear as to the nature of 
Applicant’s finances until approximately February 2007. He stated in his e-QIP that he 
had a “lack in finances that were coming in,”10 apparently referring to a lack of income. 
However, in reviewing his December 2012 credit report, it appears that in 2007 and 
2008, several accounts started to become delinquent. Additional delinquencies 
eventually ensued. Other than that one comment, Applicant did not attribute his initial 
delinquent debts to any one factor. In any event, for unspecified reasons, accounts 
became delinquent and they were placed for collection.  
The SOR identified 13 purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, totaling 
approximately $38,375, as reflected by the December 2012 credit report,11 and the 
March 2015 credit report.12 Those debts and their respective current status, according 
to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by the Government and Applicant, and 
Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below:  
SOR ¶¶ 1.a., 1.c., and 1.d.: These are three medical accounts for professional 
services with unpaid balances of $251, $360, and $179 that were placed for collection in 
2008 and 2009.13 Applicant contacted the credit reporting agency to determine the 
identity of the medical providers, but was unable to obtain the requested information 
from them. He also spoke with the two hospitals in his local area but they could not 
assist him either. Only the account for $251 remains listed in his March 2015 credit

report.14 Applicant disavowed responsibility for the accounts because he was unmarried 
at the time and did not have a child, and he could not recall any incident requiring 
medical treatment during that period.15 The accounts are unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.e.: This is a bank credit card with a high credit of $7,367 and unpaid 
and past-due balance of $3,256 that was placed for collection.16 Applicant contacted the 
collection agent to establish a repayment plan. Under that plan, Applicant made several 
small payments over time, and in July 2014, approximately 15 months before the SOR 
was issued, he made his final payment. Applicant’s cumulative payments of $6,328.15 
left a remaining balance of zero.17 The account was no longer listed in his March 2015 
credit report.18 The account has been resolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b., 1.j. through 1.m.: These are federal student loan accounts for both 
subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans that, over time, were transitioned, 
transferred, or sold by and between the state student loan agency, the U.S. Department 
of Education, a loan servicing agent, and a collection agency when they were placed for 
collection.19 Applicant routinely made monthly payments by automatic withdrawal from 
July 2011 through March 2012, but when a new bank account debit card was issued 
replacing the old card (because of a bank merger), his payments ceased without 
Applicant’s knowledge.20 The loans, totaling $22,424.75, went into a default status. 
They were placed for collection with one collection agent. Applicant entered into a 
repayment installment agreement under which, commencing in January 2016, he was to 
make regular monthly payments of $50 for a period of six months. At that point, based 
on his finances, an adjustment in the payment amount would be considered.21 Applicant 
has made two monthly payments each month to the U.S. Department of Education’s 
Default Resolution Group since the commencement of the agreement.22 Those 
payments are applied to accrued interest and fees. The accounts are in the process of 
being resolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.f. through 1.i.: These are state student loan accounts for both 
subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans for which Applicant routinely made his 
monthly payments by automatic withdrawal until March 2012. When the debit card issue

arose, his payments ceased without Applicant’s knowledge.23 The loans went into a 
default status and then into a deferred status as he was still enrolled in school.24 
Applicant made some individual payments, and along with his 2012 income tax refund 
that was involuntarily applied by the state to his unpaid student loan balance, he was 
credited with paying $14,425.69.25 Applicant entered into a repayment installment 
agreement under which, commencing in May 2016, he was to make regular monthly 
payments of $124.26 Applicant has made monthly payments by automatic withdrawal 
each month since the commencement of the agreement.27 The accounts are in the 
process of being resolved. 
While he did not submit a written personal financial statement, Applicant 
estimated that his monthly net income is $2,200, and after unspecified monthly 
expenses, he has a monthly remainder of between $200 and $400 available for saving 
or spending.28 He has a checking account with a balance of approximately $700, and a 
401(k) retirement account with approximately $3,000.29 His wife maintains a separate 
savings account with approximately $3,000.30 In lieu of a written budget, Applicant and 
his wife rely on the bank phone applications and computer on-line accounting to keep 
track of their income and expenses.31 Applicant has no other outstanding debts. In the 
absence of any additional unidentified delinquencies, it appears that Applicant's 
financial problems are under control. 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a [position of public trust].”32 As Commander in 
Chief, the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on 
national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to 
have access to such information. Positions designated as ADP-I and ADP-II are 
classified as “sensitive positions.”33 “The standard that must be met for . . . assignment

to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s loyalty, 
reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties 
is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.”34 DOD contractor personnel 
are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final 
unfavorable access determination may be made.35  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a public trust 
position. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”36 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.37 
  
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
                                                          
34 Regulation ¶ C6.1.1.1. 
 
35 Regulation ¶ C8.2.1. It should be noted that a memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense 
for Counterintelligence and Security, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases, dated November 19, 2004, covers the 
handling of trustworthiness cases under the Directive. The memorandum directed the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) to continue to utilize the Directive in ADP contractor cases for trustworthiness determinations. 
 
36 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  
Furthermore, security clearance determinations, and by inference, public trust 
determinations, should err, if they must, on the side of denials.38 In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations 
is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
       
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. 
Under AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially 
disqualifying. Also, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” 
may raise trustworthiness concerns. Applicant’s initial financial problems arose in 2007 
and 2008 when several accounts started to become delinquent. Eventually, additional 
accounts became delinquent, and student loans went into a default status. Accounts 
were placed for collection. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) have been established.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate 
trustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the 
disqualifying condition may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, 
was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.” Also, under AG ¶ 20(b), financial trustworthiness concerns may be mitigated 
where “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the 
person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person has received or is receiving 
counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶

8 
                                      
 
20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”39  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) partially apply. The nature of 
Applicant’s multi-year period of financial difficulties since 2007 and 2008 make it difficult 
to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” However, it appears 
that Applicant’s initial financial problems were caused by events that were both largely 
and minimally beyond his control: he was laid off in 2005 and given a severance 
package sufficient to take off an entire year to return to school full-time to obtain his 
associate’s degree, and subsequently, he had a lack of income. With insufficient income 
to address his debts, some accounts were dormant. He continued his education with 
additional student loans. Applicant routinely made his monthly student loan payments 
by automatic withdrawal from July 2011 through March 2012, but when there was a 
bank merger, a new bank account debit card was issued replacing the old card, his 
payments ceased without Applicant’s knowledge. 
 
 Upon learning of his financial predicament, Applicant eventually contacted his 
creditors to set up repayment plans and started making payments. He entered into a 
repayment installment agreement under which he has been making regular monthly 
payments on his federal student loans. Applicant made some individual payments, and 
along with his 2012 income tax refund that was involuntarily applied by the state to his 
unpaid state student loan balance, he was credited with paying $14,425.69.  His state 
student loans were in a deferred status until recently. Both types of student loans are 
currently in the repayment process. A delinquent credit card account was resolved in 
July 2014, approximately 15 months before the SOR was issued.  
Applicant estimated that he has a monthly remainder of between $200 and $400 
available for saving or spending. He has a checking account with a balance of 
approximately $700, and a 401(k) retirement account with approximately $3,000. His 
wife maintains a separate savings account with approximately $3,000. They keep track 
of their income and expenses. Other than the three delinquent medical accounts with a 
combined unpaid balance of $790 about which Applicant has been unable to track down 
and resolve. he has no other outstanding debts. In the absence of any additional 
unidentified delinquencies, it appears that Applicant's financial problems are under 
                                                          
39 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

control. Applicant’s actions no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.40 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.41   
     
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He initially failed 
to exercise sufficient control over his expenses to maintain his various accounts in a 
current status. Several accounts, including his student loans, became delinquent and 
were placed into a default status.  
 
 The mitigating evidence is more substantial. There is no evidence of misuse of 
information technology systems, mishandling protected information, or substance 
abuse. Instead, Applicant was laid off during a reduction in force, and with his 
severance package, he attempted to better himself by completing his initial college 
degree. He then went on to obtain another degree. While his efforts to keep all of his 
accounts in a current status fell short of Applicant’s desires, he did engage his creditors 
in attempts to establish payment plans. A bank merger created financial difficulties 
when his normal monthly student loan payments were, without his knowledge, disrupted 
and cancelled. He paid off one delinquent credit card 15 months before the SOR was 
issued. He entered into repayment installment agreements regarding his student loans. 
While it may take some time for those loans to be paid off, those loans are being paid at 
a rate agreed to by the creditors. Applicant has only the three delinquent medical debts, 
                                                          
40 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).

Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

and once he can identify the creditors and verify his responsibility for them, he intends 
to resolve them. There are no other delinquencies.  
 
 Applicant has embraced the paradigm of fiscal responsibility. Applicant did not 
conceal his financial difficulties when completing his e-QIP. Instead, he was honest and 
forthright, and he reported them. The undisputed developed evidence enables me to 
conclude that there are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are now 
under control. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 42 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a good track record of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts, limited only by his modest earnings. With $3,256, he paid off one 
credit card account, and was already credited with paying $14,425.69 on state student 
loans. The student loan payments continue. He keeps track of his expenses.  
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a position of public trust. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.m.: For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility to 
occupy a public trust position to support a contract with DOD.  Eligibility is granted.
