Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his eligibility for
access to classified information. The evidence is not sufficient to explain and mitigate
Applicant’s financial problems or difficulties. Accordingly, this case is decided against
Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on October 29, 2012, for a periodic reinvestigation.  About1
three years later on October 2, 2015, after reviewing the application and information
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).

gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD)  sent2
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified
information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the3
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. He
answered the SOR on November 6, 2015, and requested a hearing.          
The case was assigned to me on February 22, 2016. The hearing was held as
scheduled on May 24, 2016. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1–5, and they were
admitted. Applicant testified on his own behalf and offered Exhibit A, and it was
admitted. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on June 2, 2016.
The record was kept open until June 30, 2016, to allow Applicant to submit
additional documentation.  He made a timely submission on June 29  consisting of his4 th
IRS account transcripts for tax years 2009 through 2015, and they are admitted without
objections as Exhibits B–H. He made an untimely submission on August 5  of his DDth
Form 214, and it is admitted without objections as Exhibit I. 
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 57-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance
that he has held for many years. His background includes 20 years of honorable military
service, which concluded in 2001 when he retired.  His primary speciality was working5
as an avionics technician. He has since been employed as an electronics technician for
a defense contractor in support of the military. He has worked for his current employer
since August 2009. He has a good employment record as shown by a strong letter of
recommendation from his site manager, who describes Applicant as “an outstanding
electronic and computer repair technician” who is “proven to be honest, dependable,
and responsible.”  He has been married since 1990, and he has two adult children. His6
spouse is employed by a state agency.

 Although the medical collection accounts remain unpaid, they are decided for Applicant for the following9
reasons: (1) they are for minor if not trivial amounts; (2) medical debts are presumed to be incurred for
necessary medical care and treatment as opposed to frivolous or irresponsible spending; and (3) he has no
idea of the basis of the debts. Accordingly, they are not discussed further herein.

Applicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties, which he does not
dispute. He disclosed an adverse financial record in his 2012 security clearance
application.  He stated that he had severe credit-card problems, things snowballed and7
he fell into deeper debt, but he had been working for the past two-plus years to remedy
the problems. He reported that he had failed to pay about $2,000 in total in federal
income taxes for tax years 2009 and 2010. He further reported four delinquent credit
card accounts for a total of about $17,550. He provided additional details about his
financial record (concerning three listed and three unlisted delinquent debts) during his
December 2012 background investigation.    8
Under Guideline F, the SOR allegations fall into three groups: (1) Applicant failed
to file a federal income tax return, as required, for tax years 2009 and 2010; (2) an
unpaid $7,909 charged-off account stemming from a credit card account; and (3) two
unpaid medical collection accounts for $119 and $25.  The SOR allegations are9
established by Department Counsel’s documentary evidence, Applicant’s documentary
evidence, and Applicant’s admissions in his answer to the SOR and his hearing
testimony. 
At the hearing, Applicant conceded he was not completely certain what led to his
tax problems for tax years 2009 and 2010.  He believes the tax problems stem from his10
change of employers in 2009; his former employer gave him a check for the proceeds
(about $18,000) of his 401(k) account; he misplaced the check at his home; and he
failed to timely rollover the proceeds into another qualified account.  He discovered this11
circumstance during the 2009 tax season (in 2010), he found the check in a roll-top
desk, and deposited it in a regular bank account. He admits that he should have
obtained professional tax assistance to address the issue, but he continued to handle
his federal income tax returns.12

hearing, show the following:13

• For tax year 2009, no tax return was filed, and the account balance is $0.  The14
filing status of single with no exemptions is indicative of no return filed. In April
2012, a $3,640 credit was transferred from his 2011 tax return.15
• For tax year 2010, a substitute tax return was prepared by the IRS on February
11, 2013, and the account balance is $0.11.  The filing status of single with one16
exemption is indicative of no return filed. In April 2013, a $998 credit was
transferred from his 2012 tax return.  A tax return was secured on August 21,17
2013. Thereafter, in September 2013, Applicant was assessed a $1,226 penalty
for filing the tax return after the due date; he was charged $532 interest for late
payment; and he was assessed a $790 penalty for late payment of tax. In April
2014, a $6,800 credit was transferred from his 2013 tax return.  Collection18
notices were issued in May and June 2014; a payment of $1,640 was made in
October 2014; and he was charged $165 for interest and assessed a $272
penalty for late payment of tax in November 2014.   19
• For tax years 2011–2015, Applicant timely filed his returns by the April 15th
deadline or within an extension of time, and the account balances are $0.  The20
filing status is married filing jointly with four or three exemptions. He received
sizable refunds (e.g., about $5,000) for tax years 2012, 2014, and 2015. He and
his spouse had taxable income of more than $100,000 annually for tax years
2011–2015.
Applicant had no further information or documentation for the $7,909 charged-off
account in SOR ¶ 1.c.  He disclosed the account in his 2012 security clearance21
application, and he was asked about it during his 2012 background investigation.  The22
account is listed in credit reports from 2012 and 2015.  He explained he was paying off23
other credit card accounts and by the time he got to this account, it had been written off,

and he thought he could do nothing more with the account.  He has made no recent24
efforts to resolve the debt, and it remains unresolved.
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As25
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt26
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An27
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  28
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting29
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An30
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate31
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  32
In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a
preponderance of the evidence.  The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s33

reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence
standard.34
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it35
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant36
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 37
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  38
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.

 AG ¶ 20(a)–(f).41

The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties as well as inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and a failure
to file federal income tax returns for two years. His tax problems with the IRS for tax
years 2009 and 2010 combined with his lack of attention to the unresolved charged-off
credit card account for $7,909 are sufficient to raise a serious concern.  His tax39
problems were discovered during the 2009 tax season, but went unresolved until
October 2014 when he made the last payment for tax year 2010.  His tax problems40
deserve close examination because failure to timely file tax returns or pay taxes
suggests that an applicant has a problem complying with well-established governmental
rules and systems. And voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential
for protecting classified information.   
I considered the six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and none,41
individually or taken together, is sufficient to mitigate the concern. Applicant’s tax
problems are due to his negligence in 2009, when he mishandled the check from the
401(k) account, and it was not seen again until sometime in 2010. His tax problems
were recently resolved in October 2014. It is also noted that most of the back taxes for
2009 and 2010 were paid by application of refunds from other tax years as opposed to
voluntary payments. Further, his financial problems are ongoing as reflected by the
unresolved charged-off account for $7,909. He has had the past several years to
address the account, and he has done nothing to address it once it was charged off,
which does not eliminate or cancel out the indebtedness. Given his level of annual
income, he should have been in a position to pay off or settle this account for a lesser
amount without great difficultly. Based on the totality of facts and circumstances, I
conclude that Applicant did not make a reasonable effort to resolve his tax problems or
resolve the charged-off account. 
In addition to considering the formal mitigating circumstances, I gave favorable
consideration to Applicant’s honorable military service; his long record of holding a
security clearance without a security infraction or violation; his good employment record;
and his voluntarily reporting of adverse financial information in his security clearance
application. Although those circumstances are certainly favorable, they are not enough
to completely mitigate the serious concern stemming from his tax problems and the
unresolved charged-off account.   
Applicant’s history of financial problems or difficulties creates doubt about his
current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified
information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and
considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice

versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I42
conclude that he did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified
information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.e: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
