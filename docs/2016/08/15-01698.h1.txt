Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny him eligibility for
access to classified information. He did not present sufficient evidence to demonstrate
that he has made a reasonable effort to resolve his financial problems. Accordingly, this
case is decided against Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on March 3, 2014.  Thereafter on October 13, 2015, after1
reviewing the application and information gathered during a background investigation,
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).

the Department of Defense (DOD)  sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR),2
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to a3
complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action under the security guideline known as
Guideline F for financial considerations. He  answered the SOR on November 5, 2015,
and requested a hearing.         
The case was assigned to me on February 22, 2016. The hearing was held as
scheduled on April 13, 2016. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1–4, and they were
admitted. Applicant testified on his own behalf and offered Exhibits A–C, and they were
admitted. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional
documentation. He made a timely submission on April 15, 2016, and those matters are
admitted as Exhibits D and E. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on April
21, 2016.
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security
clearance. His education includes a high school diploma and some college. His
background includes honorable military service in the U.S. Army during 2004–2011.
During that time, he deployed three times to Iraq.  The Department of Veterans Affairs4
has given him a 50% rating for his service-connected disabilities.  He described the5
factual basis for his disabilities, which includes PTSD.  He is employed as a computer6
operator for a company doing business in the defense industry. His work involves the
operation of a firing range on a large military installation.  He has worked for his current7
employer since February 2014.

Applicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties, which he does not
dispute. Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges several matters that are summarized as
follows: (1) an unpaid $742 state tax lien filed in 2013; (2) five collection or charged-off
accounts for a total of about $14,061; and (3) a $2,000 collection account for an unpaid
student loan.  
The SOR allegations are established by Department Counsel’s documentary
evidence as well as Applicant’s admissions in his answer to the SOR.  Applicant8
addressed each of the seven delinquent debts in his hearing testimony, explaining that
they are unresolved.  He made some progress by establishing a payment plan for the9
$466 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.f, but he had not yet made the initial payment.10
In addition to the matters in the SOR, Applicant presented documentation
showing that in April 2016 he entered into a rehabilitation program for student loans not
alleged in the SOR.  The documentation shows his monthly income as $2,797 and11
monthly expenses as $2,542. That is generally consistent with his hearing testimony in
which he said he earns $2,400 monthly from his job and has no money left over at the
end of the month.  His most recent large purchase was a used pickup truck that he12
bought in August 2014 for $20,000, which carries a monthly loan payment of $472.13
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As14
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt15
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.

A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An16
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  17
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting18
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An19
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate20
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  21
In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a
preponderance of the evidence.  The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s22
reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence
standard.23
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it24
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.

financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In

Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant25
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 26
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  27
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties as well as an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.  That28
conclusion is supported by the documentary evidence and Applicant’s admissions that
establish an unpaid state tax lien, five unpaid collection accounts, and an unpaid
collection account for a student loan for a total of about $17,000. Although that is not a
large amount of delinquent debt, it is large in comparison to his annual income of about
$34,000. Applicant’s problematic financial history raises a security concern under
Guideline F.    
 I considered the six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and none,29
individually or taken together, are sufficient to explain and mitigate the security concern.
To start, Applicant’s financial problems are largely ongoing and unresolved. Moreover,
he did not present sufficient documentary evidence to demonstrate that he has made a
reasonable effort to resolve his problematic financial history. The seven delinquent
debts in the SOR are unresolved with only one of those debts at the beginning of a
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).30

repayment arrangement. Although I am persuaded that Applicant is sincere in his desire
to repay his delinquent debts, at this point it is simply too soon to tell if he will do so in
the foreseeable future. 
Applicant’s problematic financial history creates doubt about his current reliability,
trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching
this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable
evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due
consideration to the whole-person concept.  In that regard, I gave special consideration30
to his honorable military service, which includes three deployments to Iraq. Accordingly,
I conclude that he did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified
information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.g: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
