HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 The statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 15 delinquent debts totaling $41,919, 
including one federal and two state tax debts and a Chapter 13 bankruptcy was 
dismissed in 2004. He has made some progress paying his delinquent tax debts and 
improving his finances. However, his history of owing federal and state income taxes 
continues to raise unresolved financial considerations security concerns. Access to 
classified information is denied.  
 
History of the Case 
  
On October 13, 2012, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SCA). 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On September 14, 2015, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant 
to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on 
September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF could not make the affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative 
 
2 
                                         
 
judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the 
financial considerations guideline. 
 
On November 28, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a 
hearing. On February 5, 2016, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On April 20, 
2016, the case was assigned to me. On May 16, 2016, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for June 6, 2016. 
(HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled.  
 
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 
18-19, 38; Government Exhibit (GE) 1-8) Applicant offered two exhibits. (Tr. 20-21; 
Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-B) The transcript was received on June 14, 2016. On June 17, 
2016, Applicant provided four exhibits. (AE C-F) Applicant requested and received an 
extension to submit additional evidence until July 1, 2016. (HE 4) He did not provide any 
additional documents after June 17, 2016, and on August 24, 2016, I asked him 
whether he provided any additional evidence. (HE 5) On August 24, 2016, he provided 
an updated credit report, and he indicated he had received several offers of 
employment with substantial increases in pay, which could be used to pay his 
delinquent debts. (AE G; AE H) On August 25, 2016, he provided a draft property 
settlement agreement related to his pending divorce, a rental application, and an August 
25, 2016 letter from Applicant’s divorce attorney. (AE I-AE K) All exhibits were admitted 
without objection. The record closed on August 25, 2016.   
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted some of the underlying facts of the 
SOR allegations. The facts admitted are cited in the Findings of Fact section. He also 
provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted 
as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 60-year-old software deployment engineer continuously employed 
by a defense contractor since 2009. (Tr. 8-9, 29) In 1974, he graduated from high 
school. (Tr. 6) He has the equivalent to an associate’s degree. (Tr. 6) He received 
several technical certifications in information technology. (AE C) He never served in the 
military. (Tr. 8) In 1974, he married, and in 1980, he divorced. (Tr. 7) In 1981, he 
married, and in 1986, he divorced. (Tr. 8) In 1992, he married his spouse. (Tr. 7; GE 1) 
About 18 months before his hearing, he separated from his spouse. (Tr. 27-28) He and 
his spouse are negotiating a property-settlement agreement for their divorce. (AE I; AE 
K) He has an adult son and an adult stepson. (Tr. 28)   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s spouse had medical problems in the 1990s. (Tr. 24) In 2002, 
Applicant and his spouse filed for protection under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, 
and his bankruptcy was dismissed in 2004. (Tr. 31-38; GE 8; SOR ¶ 1.p) In 2005, 
Applicant’s property was damaged by Hurricane Katrina. (Tr. 24) In 2006, Applicant had 
 
3 
                                         
 
cancer. (Tr. 24) His income was reduced through various employment issues, including 
the loss of part-time employment, intermittent unemployment before 2009, and his 
spouse’s intermittent unemployment. (Tr. 73-75) Applicant wanted to obtain part-time 
employment to increase his income so he could pay his debts. (Tr. 76) Applicant has 
endeavored to reduce his expenses. (AE H; AE J)  
 
Applicant’s spouse was responsible for paying the family bills, and when 
Applicant found out about their delinquent debts, especially a large garnishment in April 
2014, he claimed that he was surprised. (Tr. 80-81) She had a long history of not paying 
their debts extending back to the 1990s. (Tr. 82-83) He described her as a “financial 
abuser.” (Tr. 30-31) She repeatedly promised to reform her behavior, and then he 
discovered that she failed to pay the family debts and caused checks to be returned for 
insufficient funds. (Tr. 30-31; 82-84) 
 
Applicant’s December 27, 2012 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 
personal subject interview discussed many of the debts alleged in the SOR, including 
the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($23,556), 1.f ($4,434), 1.j ($4,000), 1.m ($1,725), 1.n ($1,015), 
and 1.o ($3,425). (GE 2)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a $23,556 collection debt owed to an apartment complex. He 
said he went to court and lost a lawsuit. (SOR response) He said three months of rent 
with charges and interest became $23,556. (SOR response) He said, “I do plan to 
contact and negotiate the bill down to pay it but current back IRS taxes and bills [have] 
not opened up the ability to make payments just yet but I [plan to].” (Tr. 54-56; SOR 
response) He was not able to make an offer to the creditor because he did not have 
sufficient funds to make a credible settlement offer. (Tr. 54-58)     
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a $500 collection debt owed to the same apartment complex 
as in SOR ¶ 1.a. Applicant said he was unsure about whether this debt was a mistake 
or not, but if the debt is legitimate, he will pay it. (SOR response) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a $278 utility collection debt. He said, “I will investigate it. I had 
[a debt dispute company] help clean up any non-bills on credit report.” (SOR response) 
He did not pay this debt. (Tr. 58-59) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a credit card debt in collections for $569 and SOR ¶ 1.e 
alleges a credit card debt in collections for $130. He acknowledged he used these credit 
cards. (SOR response) He said, “I had this check[ed] out by [a debt dispute company] 
and thought it was settled if not [he] will set up a repayment plan.” (SOR response) He 
did not present any evidence that either of the debts were settled. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a $4,434 collection debt owed to an apartment complex. 
Applicant acknowledged the debt was in his name. (SOR response) He said he would 
seek his former spouse’s assistance paying this debt; however, he planned to pay this 
debt. (SOR response)   
 
 
4 
                                         
 
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a telecommunications collection debt for $293. He had an 
account with the creditor; however, he wants the debt dispute company to have it 
removed, if it is not his bill. (SOR response) He said if it was his bill, he would pay it. 
(SOR response) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges a telecommunications collection debt for $204. He said the bill 
is in his name, and it needs to be paid. (SOR response) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges a telecommunications collection debt for $744. He had an 
account with the creditor; however, he wants the debt dispute company to have it 
removed, if it is not his bill. (SOR response) This debt may be a duplication of the debt 
in SOR ¶ 1.g because they originate from the same telecommunications company. 
(SOR response) He said if it was his bill, he would pay it. (SOR response) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.j alleges a medical collection debt for $4,000. He admitted he was 
responsible for this debt, which related to his cancer treatment. (SOR response) He said 
payment of his current bills did not permit him to make payments on this debt; however, 
he planned to pay it. (Tr. 66; SOR response) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.k alleges a credit union collection debt for $744. He said he believed the 
debt was paid around the time of Hurricane Katrina. (SOR response) His debt dispute 
company was successful in having it removed from his credit report. (SOR response) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.l alleges a telecommunications collection debt for $302. He said he 
owed this debt, and he planned to make arrangements to pay this debt. (SOR 
response) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.m is a state tax debt for $1,725 from 2000. Applicant said when he 
purchased a home in 2000, it may have had a state tax lien on it. (Tr. 41) The previous 
owners took back a second mortgage on the property and may owe the debt. (Tr. 41) 
He employed a debt-verification company to find out whether the debt was legitimate. 
(Tr. 39-42) He did not have any documentation indicating the debt was invalid or 
incorrect. (Tr. 43)   
 
SOR ¶ 1.n is a state tax debt for $1,015. Applicant said, “I admit this is a tax bill 
that was set up for repayment by my ex-wife and was to be paid back. If I still owe I will 
address this also.” (SOR response) From July 2012 to present, he has been making 
$50 monthly payments to address the debt; however, he did not provide proof of the 
current amount owed or resolution of the debt. (Tr. 43-45; GE 2) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.o is a federal tax debt for $3,425. Applicant admitted he failed to 
withhold sufficient funds to pay his federal income taxes for tax years 2010 and 2011, 
resulting in a tax debt he could not pay when he filed his annual tax returns. (Tr. 47-50; 
SOR response; GE 1) He provided documentation showing $50 monthly payments from 
August 2012 to June 2014. (GE 2) He began paying the IRS $100 monthly in July 2014, 
and he has continued to pay $100 monthly to the IRS. (Tr. 49; GE 2) He may not have 
withheld sufficient funds for additional tax years. (Tr. 47-50) He estimated his total 
 
5 
                                         
 
federal income tax bill to be about $10,000. (Tr. 50) He expects to receive a refund on 
his 2015 federal income taxes. (Tr. 51)    
 
In June 2014, Applicant generated a budget.1 In 2014, Applicant’s gross monthly 
pay was $6,038, not including his spouse’s pay. (GE 2) It shows payments to address 
his state and federal income tax debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.n and 1.o) and one bank debt. It also 
includes $4,356 in monthly income from his spouse. His monthly net remainder is 
$1,446. This budget is obsolete as he is separated from his spouse and the family 
income is substantially reduced.  
 
Applicant provided a June 5, 2016 TransUnion credit report, which gave him a 
“very poor” credit score at 505, and this credit report did not contain several of the 
collection debts he acknowledged, as well as his state and federal tax debts. The 
TransUnion credit report revealed Applicant has a $45,827 collection debt owed to the 
federal government for a post-Hurricane Katrina loan. (Tr. 66-69; AE B) When he 
completed his October 13, 2012 SCA, he said he was five payments of $170 per month 
behind on this debt, because of lack of income and maxed out credit cards. (GE 1) He 
said the federal government threatened to garnish his pay, and he is now paying $814 
monthly to address this debt. (Tr. 66-68)2 He did not provide proof of the $814 monthly 
payments or amount currently owed on this debt. 
 
On August 24, 2016, Applicant said he had two offers of employment with 
significant pay increases. (AE G) He would use the pay increases to address his 
delinquent debts. (AE G) His July 18, 2016 combined credit report shows improvement 
as it only contains two delinquent and three derogatory entries. (AE H) This credit report 
does not show entries for his delinquent state and federal taxes or his unpaid post-
Hurricane Katrina federal disaster loan. (AE H)

(GE 2) 
 
2Applicant’s SOR does not allege that he failed to repay his federal loan received in the aftermath 
of Hurricane Katrina, resulting in a delinquent debt for about $45,000, and it does not allege all of the tax 
years where he owes income taxes totaling about $10,000. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may 
be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.

Consideration that Applicant failed to timely repay his federal disaster loan after Hurricane Katrina and to 
fully pay his federal income taxes for some tax years after 2011 when due will not be considered except 
for the five purposes listed above.

There are several ongoing class-action lawsuits resulting from damage from 
Hurricane Katrina. (Tr. 71-72) He received notice that he would receive several hundred 
dollars, and there is at least one class-action lawsuit that is unresolved. (Tr. 72-74) 
 
In sum, Applicant did not make any payments to any of the SOR creditors, 
except to the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.n and 1.o. (Tr. 62-63) He disputed some of the 
amounts of the debts, especially the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a. (Tr. 63) He used a debt dispute 
company to investigate his responsibility for paying the debts. (Tr. 62-66) Several SOR 
debts were removed from his credit report. Several debts are still under investigation. 
     
Character Evidence 
 
 Applicant provided his resume and documentation showing he volunteers and 
teaches in his community. He has a strong technical background with many years of 
experience providing advice and assistance to the government especially in the realm of 
information technology. (AE A-D) He received a letter of appreciation and two 
certificates of appreciation for his outstanding performance of duty and contributions to 
mission accomplishment in 2014. (GE 2)  
 
 Applicant’s division chief describes Applicant as having very good moral 
character with integrity. (AE A) He is efficient, considerate, dedicated, honest, 
compassionate, careful, and trustworthy. (AE A) He has received several honors for his 
dedication to his work. (AE A)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
 
7 
                                         
 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this 
decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
 
8 
                                         
 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt 
is documented in his credit reports, SCA, SOR response, and hearing record. The SOR 
alleges 15 delinquent debts totaling $41,919, including one federal and two state tax 
debts and a Chapter 13 bankruptcy dismissed in 2004. He has had delinquent debts for 
more than four years. Applicant failed to withhold sufficient funds for his federal income 
taxes for 2010 and 2011, which resulted in a federal tax debt that is currently 
unresolved.  
 
  In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board 
explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). The Government established the disqualifying conditions in 
AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of 
mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;3 and  
                                            
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
 
9 
                                         
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
None of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, he provided some 
mitigating information. Six circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his 
finances: (1) His spouse had medical problems in the 1990s; (2) In 2005, his property 
was damaged by Hurricane Katrina; (3) In 2006, Applicant had cancer; (4) His income 
was reduced through various employment issues, including the loss of part-time 
employment and intermittent periods of unemployment before 2009; (5) His spouse had 
intermittent periods of unemployment; and (6) His separation from his spouse and their 
pending divorce. However, he did not provide sufficient evidence that he acted 
responsibly under the circumstances. There is insufficient specific information about the 
effects of these circumstances on his finances, especially over the last three years. 
 
Applicant is credited with mitigating four SOR debts: ¶ 1.b because it is a 
duplicate of the debt in ¶ 1.a; ¶ 1.g because it is a duplicate of the debt in 1.i; and 1.k; 
and 1.m are mitigated because of their age and the lack of evidence of their current 
validity. He has reduced his expenses, and he indicates he has two offers of 
employment with substantial pay increases, and he assured he intends to pay his 
unresolved debts.  
 
Applicant’s failure to timely pay his taxes in full raises the most significant 
security concern. For tax years 2010 and 2011, he failed to pay his federal income 
                                                                                                                                            
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

taxes in full when due. He currently has a federal tax debt of about $10,000. He also 
owes an unspecified amount of state income taxes. Although he has a payment plan to 
resolve his federal and state tax debts, he did not provide enough specific details about 
his finances to explain why he did not make more progress resolving his tax debts. 
Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a 60-year-old software deployment engineer continuously employed 
by a defense contractor since 2009. He has the equivalent to an associate’s degree, 
and he received several technical certifications in information technology. In 1992, he 
married his spouse. About 18 months before his hearing, he separated from his spouse.  
 
Applicant volunteers and teaches in his community. He has a strong technical 
background with many years of experience providing advice and assistance to the 
government especially in the realm of information technology. His division chief 
describes Applicant as having very good moral character with integrity. He is efficient, 
considerate, dedicated, honest, compassionate, careful, and trustworthy. He has 
received several honors for his dedication to his work.  
 
Six circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his finances; however, 
he did not establish that he acted reasonably under the circumstances. He had ample 
notice of his spouse’s poor financial management. Nevertheless, he continued to allow 
her to have access to his bank accounts. He has had steady employment since 2009. 
He has reduced his expenses; he indicates he has two offers of employment with 
substantial pay increases; and he assured he intends to pay the unresolved debts. He 
 
11 
                                         
 
has mitigated four debts and his Chapter 13 bankruptcy is not sufficiently recent to pose 
a security concern. 
 
In 2010, 2011, and perhaps for other tax years, Applicant failed to withhold 
sufficient funds for his federal income taxes, and he currently owes about $10,000 to the 
IRS. He also owes state tax debts. He has been making payments on his delinquent 
taxes. However, his history of failing to fully pay his federal and state income taxes 
when due raises unresolved financial considerations security concerns.4 When an issue 
of delinquent taxes is involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how long 
an applicant waits to file their tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax returns, 
and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete making 
payments.5 There is no evidence Applicant failed to timely file his tax returns; however, 
the primary problem here is that Applicant has owed taxes to the IRS since 2010 or 
2011. He did not prove his inability to make greater progress resolving his tax debts. His 
payment history and current balance regarding his federal disaster loan is also unclear. 
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to 
Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a 
determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for 
award of a security clearance in the future. With more effort towards documented 
                                            
4See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security 
clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A security clearance represents 
an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor 
other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and 
ability to protect classified information.”). 
 
5See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance 
and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only 
after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated 
himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone 
entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) 
(reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances 
beyond applicant’s control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and 
garnishment of Applicant’s wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); 
ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting 
not all tax returns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More 
recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a 
security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited that applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax 
years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed 
his tax returns and paid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The 
Appeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, 
contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations 
regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax 
returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established government rules 
and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted).

resolution of his past-due debt, and a track record of behavior consistent with his 
obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security 
clearance worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. I conclude that financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated.
