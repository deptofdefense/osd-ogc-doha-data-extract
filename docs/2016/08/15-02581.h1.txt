GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 20, 2012, Applicant applied for a public trust position and 
submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On 
November 24, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to DOD 
Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended 
and modified (Regulation); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified 
(Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to 
Classified Information (effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all 
adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged 
trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed

reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to make an affirmative finding under 
the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or 
continue Applicant’s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract 
with the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 4, 2015. In a sworn 
statement, dated December 16, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On an unspecified date, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) had issued her a set of 
interrogatories. She responded to the interrogatories on December 9, 2015.2 On 
February 29, 2016, Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to 
proceed. The case was assigned to me on April 22, 2016. A Notice of Hearing was 
issued on April 29, 2016. I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on May 19, 2016.  
 
 During the hearing, 5 Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 5), 21 Applicant 
exhibits (AE A through AE U), and 1 administrative exhibit, were admitted into evidence 
without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 1, 2016. 
I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of 
that opportunity. She timely submitted a number of additional documents, which were 
marked as AE V through AE AB, and admitted into evidence without objection. The 
record closed on June 16, 2016. 
  
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted seven of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c., 1.f., 1.g., 1.k., and 1.l.) of the 
SOR. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been a full-
time medical reviewer for a defense contractor since January 2013, as well as a part-
time licensed practical nurse, two nights per week, with another employer since 
November 2012.3 She has another part-time position, one day per week, cleaning 
condominiums.4 She is seeking to retain her eligibility for occupying a public trust 
position to support a contract with the DOD. She has never served in the U.S. military.5 
She is a 1979 high school graduate as well as a 1983 practical nursing school 
graduate.6 Applicant was married on three occasions: in January 1982, and divorced in

Financial Considerations9 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until sometime in mid-
2009 when, after a decade of emotional and physical abuse at the hands of her 
alcoholic second husband, she fled the marital home and obtained a court protection 
order. Applicant was treated for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Because she 
was in constant fear of her husband, she lived briefly with various friends. Her employer 
posted a photo of her husband at the front desk in the event he turned up at her work 
place. The eventual divorce resulted in Applicant receiving a substantial monetary 
settlement. In order to generate enough funds to enable her to contribute to household 
expenses, and to pay her bills, Applicant took a second job. Her credit score was over 
800.10 
 
Applicant met an individual who was employed where Applicant had her part-time 
job, and they eventually decided to cohabit. The relationship deteriorated over time 
when his behavior and eventual unemployment became major issues. Not wishing to 
continue supporting him, Applicant assisted him in finding an apartment where she 
cosigned the lease. Three months later, Applicant’s mother became very ill, in the early 
stages of dementia, with lung cancer, and in need of oxygen, and Applicant and her 
siblings agreed that since Applicant was a nurse, it would be best if Applicant would 
care for her. The decision would cause Applicant to relocate to another state. Before 
she left, Applicant was concerned about the cosigned lease because of her friend’s 
increasingly bizarre and paranoid behavior, so she contacted the facility manager to 
have her name removed from the lease. Applicant’s former cohabitant remained in the 
apartment until September that same year.11 
 
Applicant subsequently discovered that her former cohabitant had stolen one of 
her checkbooks and forged her name, stealing approximately $25,000 of her divorce 
settlement monies. Criminal charges were brought against him, and after Applicant 
cooperated in his prosecution, Applicant only got back $10,000 of the stolen money. In 
the interim, checks bounced and her medical expenses were generated. While residing

with her mother, Applicant assisted her with town taxes, medical expenses, food, and 
utilities.12 
 
Applicant met her current husband at their 30th high school reunion. They 
eventually married and he joined her at her childhood home. Also residing with them 
were Applicant’s daughter and granddaughter, as well as Applicant’s mother. Because 
of mounting bills associated with Applicant’s increased responsibilities, Applicant sought 
guidance from her 401(k) retirement plan representative. Based on the information 
given to her, Applicant sought a hardship loan. While she was aware of the penalty or 
interest to be generated by the early withdrawal, Applicant was not advised that the 
amount of the loan would be added to her gross income.13 
 
Three weeks after Applicant’s mother passed away in March 2012, one of 
Applicant’s brothers served Applicant with eviction papers. The eviction caused 
Applicant, her husband, her daughter, and granddaughter to relocate, and while they 
searched for a new home and jobs, they were given some financial assistance from her 
brother-in-law. Applicant obtained her two part-time jobs, but her husband was unable 
to gain new employment until October 2012. That job only lasted until the end of 
January 2013. Applicant then took on a third job. She reduced expenses where possible 
and sought assistance at food banks to get them through a rough year. In October 
2014, her husband found another job. At some point, Applicant’s husband suffered 
seizures, and then another significant health issue. In December 2014, Applicant 
suffered a mini-stroke and was hospitalized.14  
 
Each of the above incidents and factors either resulted in increased or additional 
costs to Applicant or to a decrease in the family income. As a result of those varied 
circumstances, Applicant was unable to routinely maintain her normal monthly 
payments. Some accounts became delinquent, and they were placed for collection. Her 
state and federal income taxes were revised upward because of her 401(k) withdrawals. 
 
Applicant contacted various creditors, established repayment arrangements, and 
made payments. She also met with a financial advisor in an effort to learn better ways of 
handling her finances.15 She set up a budget that indicates her monthly income is 
$4,220, her total monthly expenses are $3,974.31, and she has a remainder of $245.69 
available for discretionary saving or spending.16 It is unclear if Applicant’s budget 
includes the $300 her daughter gives her for food each month, or if Applicant’s 
husband’s salary is included.

The SOR identified 12 purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, totaling 
approximately $23,173, as reflected by the January 2013 credit report,17 the March 
2015 credit report,18 and the September 2015 credit report.19 Those debts and their 
respective current status, according to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by 
the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are 
described below:  
SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.l: These are two “snapshots” of the same state income tax 
account caused by Applicant’s withdrawal of her 401(k) funds. In May 2012, the state 
department of taxation noted that Applicant had $4,036 in total payments and 
refundable credits, leaving a balance of $3,054.16, for the tax period 2011.20 On May 1, 
2013, the same state entity obtained a judgment against Applicant in the amount of 
$3,416.21 One week later, her anticipated $339 refund from her 2012 income taxes was 
applied to the 2011 balance.22 In October 2015, the state department of taxation 
restated Applicant’s income tax liability for the tax period 2011: tax assessed was 
$3,034; interest assessed was $925.81; penalty assessed was $586.14; payments or 
credits were $339; and the current balance due was $4,206.95.23 Applicant sought 
eligibility for entry into the state’s Offer in Compromise Program for “financially 
distressed taxpayers to put overwhelming tax liabilities behind them by paying a 
reasonable amount in compromise and becoming productive members of the 
economy.”24 She made three separate repayment offers, with the initial one being 
rejected, and the remaining two not yet resolved.25 She also agreed to an alternative 
repayment plan under which she makes monthly payments of $100. As of the hearing 
date, Applicant contended she had already made two such payments.26 Applicant failed 
to submit documentation to support her contentions that a repayment agreement had 
been established or that payments had been made. Nevertheless, in spite of the 
missing documentation, under the circumstances presented, it appears that the account 
is in the process of being resolved.

SOR ¶ 1.b.: This is a medical account with a high credit of $216 and a remaining 
unpaid balance of $191 (that insurance failed to cover) that was placed for collection 
following Applicant’s treatment for a mini-stroke.27 On May 27, 2016, Applicant 
contacted the current holder of the account and made the entire payment of $191.28 The 
account has been resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.c.: This is a medical account with a remaining unpaid balance of $76 
that was placed for collection following Applicant’s treatment for a mini-stroke.29 On May 
27, 2016, Applicant contacted the current holder of the account and made the entire 
payment of $76, but it appears that the check was never cashed.30 Applicant has had no 
further contact with the collection agent, but is willing to furnish a substitute check if the 
first one cannot be found.31 The account has either been resolved or is in the process of 
being so. 
SOR ¶ 1.d.: This is an apartment lease that Applicant cosigned for her former 
boyfriend with an unpaid balance of $4,650 that was placed for collection.32 Although 
Applicant had contacted the facility manager to have her name removed from the lease 
when she moved out of state, and she was under the impression that her request had 
been honored, she later learned that her name remained on the lease. Applicant claims 
to be assisting the creditor in their effort to locate her former boyfriend. In the event he 
cannot be located, she was willing to negotiate a settlement or to start making payments 
towards at least one-half of the remaining balance. Her offer was rejected.33 As a lease 
cosigner, Applicant remains legally responsible for the unpaid balance. The account 
remains unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.e.: This is a bank credit card account with a $300 credit limit that was 
placed for collection, and charged off in the amount of $505.  The account was sold to a 
debt purchaser.34 Applicant contacted the debt purchaser and agreed to a repayment 
settlement. An unspecified amount was paid to the debt purchaser and the account was 
considered satisified.35 The account has been resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.f.: This is a bank credit card account with a credit limit of $775 and a 
past-due balance of $1,196 that was charged off in January 2013, and sold to a debt

purchaser.36 Applicant contacted the current holder of the account and agreed to a 
settlement of $358.80 provided monthly payments were made as agreed. Applicant 
made her initial payment of $81.76 in February 2016, and subsequent monthly 
payments of $71.76 followed. The final payment was due in June 2016.37 Although 
Applicant failed to submit documentation regarding payments made after her initial one 
or a letter from the current collection agent, it appears that the account, if not already 
resolved, is in the process of being resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.g.: This is a bank credit card account with a $720 credit limit and high 
credit of $988 that was placed for collection, and charged off in the amount of $660.  
The account was sold to a debt purchaser in September 2007.38 Applicant contacted the 
original creditor who referred her to the debt purchaser. The creditor said that 
Applicant’s balance with it was zero, but that she “may still owe something to [the debt 
purchaser].”39 Although Applicant made numerous telephone calls and wrote two letters 
to the debt purchaser, she has never received any response to her resolution efforts.40 
Other than the letter informing her that the account had been sold, Applicant failed to 
submit any documentation to support the existence of her follow-up efforts to contact 
the debt purchaser. Considering the age of the debt, it appears that the statute of 
limitations may have run making the debt generally unenforceable at this late date 
unless it has been re-aged by Applicant. Furthermore, the debt is not listed in 
Applicant’s most recent credit report under the debt purchaser’s name, and the creditor 
has requested that the debt under its name be deleted by the credit reporting 
agencies.41 Nevertheless, it appears that the account has not been resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.h.: This is a telephone land-line account with a past-due balance of $58 
that was placed for collection.42 Applicant insisted that she had called the creditor before 
closing the account in June 2012 and was told that there was no outstanding balance. 
She was subsequently informed that the account was in collection, but no one was able 
to tell her what the delinquency was for.43 Applicant claimed to have made the payment, 
but that payment was apparently lost and the account was transferred to another 
collection agent. Upon learning of the situation and the new collection agent, in 
February 2016, Applicant sent that collection agent a check for $58.83. The payment 
was returned to Applicant in March 2016 stating that all future payments should be

forwarded to yet another collection agent.44 A money order was then sent to the new 
collection agent in May 2016.45 The account has been resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.i.: This is a bank credit card account with a credit limit of $250, a past-
due balance of $160, and an unpaid balance of $331 that was placed for collection and 
charged off in December 2006.46 It was subsequently transferred or sold to another 
collection agent. Applicant contended the account became delinquent when she 
separated from her second husband, and that when she received monies from a 
workmen’s compensation case in 2008 or 2009, she paid the entire balance.47 When 
she called the creditor or the collection agent, Applicant was informed that the account 
had been sold and there was no further information available.48 Applicant failed to 
submit any documentation to support the existence of her purported payments or her 
follow-up efforts to contact the creditor or collection agents. Considering the age of the 
debt, it appears that the statute of limitations may have run making the debt generally 
unenforceable at this late date unless it has been re-aged by Applicant. Furthermore, 
the debt is not listed in Applicant’s more recent credit reports under the creditor’s name 
or the collection agents’ names. Applicant intends to continue her efforts to locate the 
current holder of the account. It appears that the account has not been resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.j.: This is a utility account at the apartment for which Applicant served 
as a cosigner with an unpaid balance of $426 that was placed for collection.49 For the 
same reasons she gave with respect to her disputed responsibility for the apartment 
lease, Applicant disputed responsibility for this cosigned utility account. She has made 
efforts to locate her former boyfriend to persuade the creditor and collection agents to 
seek payment from him.50 As an account cosigner, Applicant remains legally 
responsible for the unpaid balance. The account remains unresolved. 
 SOR ¶ 1.k.: This is Applicant’s income tax account with the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) which originally covered insufficient income tax payments for the tax year 
2011. Although Applicant’s withholding for the year was $16,283, and she made modest 
irregular payments with and after her filed income tax return, it was subsequently 
determined that Applicant’s actions with respect to her 401(k) required an upward 
adjustment of her tax for the year. Interest and penalties were added. Adjustments, 
interest, and penalties were also made for the tax years 2012, 2013, and 2014. An 
installment agreement was established in July 2014, but it was terminated in March

2015, pending the reestablishment of a new installment agreement in June 2015.51 It is 
unclear if Applicant made any payments under those installment agreements. As of July 
10, 2015, the total balance due for the four-year tax period was $7,057.70, including 
interest and penalties.52 The IRS rejected Applicant’s proposed monthly payment 
amount, but indicated it was willing to accept monthly payments of $85.53 Although 
Applicant indicated in December 2015 that she had an installment agreement in place 
under which she was to make monthly payments of $100,54 in fact, that installment 
agreement was not established until May 2016, with the first such payment, along with a 
$120 user fee, due on June 25, 2016.55 An income tax overpayment to another state 
department of revenue, in the amount of $1,682, was transferred to the IRS in April 
2016.56 Applicant indicated that modest withholdings were made from one of her part-
time incomes, and that she had increased withholding to $50 per month.57 She indicated 
that her payments would be taken out of her paycheck.58 She also stated that, as of the 
hearing, she had made two monthly $100 payments under this installment agreement.59 
Applicant also contended that her IRS balance is now down to a little over $4,000, as 
purportedly set forth in AE M.60 Applicant is confused and her contention is inaccurate, 
for AE M does not state any current balance, but AE B, from the state department of 
taxation does. Applicant failed to submit any documentation to support the existence of 
her accepted installment agreement or her purported payments to the IRS. In the 
absence of such documentation, the account is not yet in the process of being resolved. 
Applicant dedicated herself to becoming financially stable, and she has resolved 
at least one non-SOR delinquent account which had an unpaid balance of $127.61 She 
refuses to get or use credit cards, and has not taken a vacation for four years. Instead, 
she routinely works six days a week at three jobs to generate income to apply to her 
debts.62 In the absence of any additional unidentified delinquencies, it appears that 
Applicant's financial problems are finally closer to becoming under control.

Work Performance, Character References, and Community Service 
 
 Applicant was a member of the ladies auxiliary of a veterans organization to 
assist veterans; a volunteer at a local center for developmentally disabled children; 
active in the church choir; active in an organization assisting recovering breast cancer 
survivors; a volunteer assisting women and children in domestic violence situations; a 
nurse-volunteer at a hospital in the days following the 9/11 terrorist attacks; a volunteer 
in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina searching for abandoned pets; and a participant in 
Honor Flight accompanying military veterans on their visit to Washington, D.C. After 
9/11, she attempted to join the U.S. military but was rejected as being too old. Her 
stepson has served four tours in Afghanistan.63 
Applicant’s former supervisor noted that Applicant consistently met or surpassed 
all measurable performance standards, and that she exhibited a “team player mindset, 
enthusiastic embrace of change, ability to work with minimum supervision, and 
unwavering commitment to provide a quality product.”64 Other professional colleagues 
describe Applicant as respectful, knowledgeable, reliable, hard-working, honest, 
resourceful, and dedicated, with a willingness to go the extra mile.65  Applicant’s rating 
on responsibility (accountability for actions, acts in the best interests of the company, 
and acts in a compliant and ethical manner) has consistently been “meets 
expectations.”66 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”67 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. Positions designated as ADP-I and ADP-II are classified as 
“sensitive positions.”68 “The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive 
duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s loyalty, reliability, and 
trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security.”69 Department of Defense contractor

personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any 
final unfavorable access determination may be made.70  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a public trust 
position. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”71 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.72  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  
Furthermore, security clearance determinations, and by inference, public trust 
determinations, should err, if they must, on the side of denials.73 In reaching this

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations 
is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
       
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. 
Under AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially 
disqualifying. Also, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” 
may raise trustworthiness concerns. Applicant’s initial financial problems arose in mid-
2009 when she fled the marital home. Thereafter, for a variety of reasons, she had 
insufficient money to maintain all of her monthly payments. Various accounts became 
delinquent. Some of those accounts, both SOR and non-SOR, were placed for 
collection or charged off. Some accounts were sold to debt purchasers. AG ¶¶ 19(a) 
and 19(c) have been established.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate 
trustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the 
disqualifying condition may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, 
was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.” Also, under AG ¶ 20(b), financial trustworthiness concerns may be mitigated 
where “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the 
person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person has received or is receiving 
counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 
20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”74 
                                                          
74
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
 
13 
                                      
 
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. The nature, 
frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing multi-year period of financial difficulties 
since mid-2009 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so 
infrequent.” Applicant was confronted with a number of issues and incidents (PTSD 
after a decade of emotional and physical abuse, separation, divorce, an unsuccessful 
follow-up relationship, victim of theft, caring for a chronically ill mother, eviction from her 
childhood home, income tax penalty for withdrawing 401(k) funds, supporting her 
daughter and granddaughter, her husband’s unemployment, her unemployment, her 
husband’s seizures and other health issues, and Applicant’s mini-stroke) over which she 
had little if any control, that facilitate the conclusion that those financial issues occurred 
under such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur.  
 
Applicant is somewhat naive regarding financial matters, especially when it 
comes to her short-sighted decisions to cosign both an apartment lease and a utility 
service agreement for a former boyfriend. She still fails to understand why she should 
be held responsible for the entire balance owed for both debts. She is apparently also 
confused by various debts, sometimes referring to one when, in fact, she should be 
referring to another. She continues to confuse her state income tax debt with her IRS 
debt. The majority of Applicant’s debt resolution efforts occurred within months after her 
receipt of the SOR.  
 
But there is also a positive side. Despite years of having to deal with the above 
issues, sometimes simultaneously, Applicant continued to serve and care for her family 
and friends. Confronted with escalating financial problems, she obtained one job, then 
another job, and finally a third job, all with the ultimate goal of resolving her financial 
issues. Although some of Applicant’s delinquent debts, both SOR and non-SOR, have 
already been resolved, she, nevertheless, continues to work six days a week at her 
three jobs to eventually facilitate her resolution of her remaining debts. She reduced 
expenses where possible, met with a financial advisor to learn better ways of handling 
her finances, set up a budget, contacted her creditors, and established some repayment 
agreements.  
 
Seven of the alleged debts in the SOR have either been resolved or are in the 
process of being resolved. The delinquent apartment lease and the utility account have 
not yet been addressed, although Applicant has held discussions with the creditors. As 
for the remaining debts, it is unclear what their status might be. Applicant contended 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

she took certain actions, but failed to submit documentation to support her contentions. 
Such documentation would reflect resolution efforts. Nevertheless, it appears that 
Applicant's financial problems are closer to becoming under control. As noted above, 
Applicant generally has a monthly remainder of $245.69 available for discretionary 
saving or spending. As she resolves some of her debts, she can start applying 
additional funds to her remaining debts. Applicant’s actions no longer cast doubt on her 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.75 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.76   
     
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. She unwisely 
cosigned an apartment lease and a utility service agreement for a former boyfriend. She 
failed to make her monthly payments on a variety of accounts, and they became 
delinquent, resulting in some being charged off. State and federal income taxes were 
revised upward, and interest and penalties were added.  
 
 The mitigating evidence is more substantial and compelling. There is no 
evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling protected 
information, or substance abuse. Applicant has been working six days per week at one 
full-time job and two part-time jobs to generate funds sufficient to resolve her debts. Her 
community service as a volunteer is noteworthy. In some ways, Applicant is unique. She 
has routinely sacrificed herself and her finances to assist others: her mother, her

daughter, her granddaughter, her current husband, and her former boyfriend. She 
embraced the responsibility of caring for loved ones both as a loving family member and 
as a professional licensed practical nurse.  
 
 Applicant also embraced the paradigm of fiscal responsibility. She prioritized her 
debts and minimized expenses. Although she was beset by a variety of issues, she 
made various efforts to resolve her delinquent accounts. Applicant did not conceal her 
financial difficulties when completing her e-QIP. Instead, she was honest and forthright, 
and she reported them. Repayment plans were established, payments made, and many 
of her accounts are now either resolved or in the process of being resolved. The 
absence of documentation to support her contentions with respect to her efforts 
regarding the other accounts prevents me from concluding that they are also in the 
process of being resolved. Nevertheless, with the developed evidence, I can conclude 
that there are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are closer to 
becoming under control. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 77 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a fair track record of debt reduction and elimination 
efforts, limited only by her modest earnings as a result of a series of issues over which 
she had little control. Nevertheless, because Applicant is currently in the process of 
resolving her remaining debts, this decision should serve as a warning that Applicant’s 
failure to continue her debt resolution efforts pertaining to those remaining accounts, or

the actual accrual of new delinquent debts, will adversely affect her future eligibility for a 
position of public trust.78  
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a position of public trust. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility to 
occupy a public trust position to support a contract with DOD.  Eligibility is granted.

 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant as security officials may continue to monitor 
her finances, this decision, including the warning, should not be interpreted as a conditional eligibility to hold a 
position of public trust to support a contract with DOD. The Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at 
any time through credit reports, investigation, and interrogatories. Approval of a position of public trust now does not 
bar the Government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the 
security [or trustworthiness] significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having 
negative security [or trustworthiness] significance.” Nevertheless, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) has no authority to attach limiting conditions, such as an interim, conditional, or probationary status, to an 
applicant’s eligibility for a position of public trust. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012)
