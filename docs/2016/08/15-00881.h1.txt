HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 The statement of reasons (SOR) alleges two federal income tax liens filed in 
2011, totaling $39,982. The SOR also alleges Applicant owes federal income taxes for 
tax years 2009 through 2011. He made some progress resolving his federal income tax 
debt; however, his history of owing federal income taxes continues to raise unresolved 
financial considerations security concerns. Access to classified information is denied.  
 
History of the Case 
  
On March 14, 2012, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (e-QIP) (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On November 20,  
2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) 
issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF could not make the affirmative 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 
 
2 
                                         
 
2) Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial 
considerations guideline. 
 
On December 30, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a 
hearing. On February 22, 2016, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On March 
21, 2016, the case was referred to me. On June 20, 2016, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for July 
14, 2016. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled.  
 
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits into evidence; 
Applicant offered five exhibits into evidence; and all exhibits were admitted without 
objection. (Tr. 17-20; Government Exhibit (GE) 1-5; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-E) The 
transcript was received on July 22, 2016.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 
1.c. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 49-year-old satellite technician employed by a defense contractor, 
who is seeking to continue his security clearance. (Tr. 6, 9; SCA) He has been a 
satellite technician since 2007. (Tr. 9) His current salary is $36 an hour. (Tr. 40) In 1986, 
he graduated from high school. (Tr. 7) He attended college for two years, and he did not 
receive a degree. (Tr. 8) He did not serve in the military. (Tr. 8) In 1981, he married, and 
in 2004, he divorced. (Tr. 9) His son was born in 2004. (GE 1) There is no evidence of 
violations of his employer’s rules, criminal conduct, or abuse of alcohol or illegal drugs.       
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant said he has owed almost $80,000 to the IRS when interest and 
penalties are included. (Tr. 36) The SOR alleges and Applicant admitted that two tax 
liens were filed against him in 2011 for a total of $39,982. He disclosed his federal 
income tax debt on his March 14, 2012 SCA. (GE 1) 
 
In 2009, Applicant moved, and he changed tax preparation services. (Tr. 21-22) 
The new tax preparation service advised him to take 10 dependents on his W-4 form 
(the maximum number of dependents), which greatly reduced withholdings for the IRS 
in 2009 through 2011. (Tr. 22-26)  
 
For tax year 2009, Applicant had only $26 withheld from his pay, and he owed 
the IRS $17,256. (Tr. 27, 48-49; GE 2) In 2010, he reached an agreement with the IRS 
to pay $200 monthly beginning in 2010. (Tr. 27) Sometimes Applicant was out of the 
installment payment program because he “kind of defaulted on the payments.” (Tr. 30-
31) He had no explanation for why he defaulted. (Tr. 31) He was busy and he traveled 
extensively as part of his work. (Tr. 36-37) 
 
 
3 
                                         
 
On February 18, 2013, Applicant filed his 2010 and 2011 federal income tax 
returns. (Tr. 22, 28-30; GE 2 at 15, 18) As of November 2015, his account balance 
owed for tax year 2010 was $27,885 and for tax year 2011 was $15,886. (GE 2 at 15, 
18)  
 
Applicant timely filed his federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 
2015. (Tr. 33) For tax years 2012 through 2015, he received the following federal 
income tax refunds: $3,400—2012; $2,094—2013; $1,460—2014; and $2,054—2015. 
(Tr. 31-32; AE A-C) He also received tax refunds from his state taxes for 2013 through 
2015 ranging from $617 to $744. (AE A-C) 
 
In October 2015, Applicant began making $436 monthly payments to the IRS, 
and in November 2015, he decided to negotiate with the IRS to resolve his tax debt. (Tr. 
35, 39; AE D) In June 2016, the Applicant and the IRS agreed to settle his tax debt for 
tax years 2008 through 2011 for $11,148. (AE D) He was credited with payment of 
$2,180 based on his $436 monthly payments from October 2015. (AE D) His agreement 
requires him to pay $8,533 within five months of May 26, 2016. (AE D) Applicant 
believed he could borrow the money from his bank to pay his IRS debt. (Tr. 49) He has 
minimal funds available in his checking and savings accounts. (Tr. 50-51)   
 
  Applicant understands the requirement to timely file and pay his federal and 
state taxes. (Tr. 46-47) He indicates he will ensure his future taxes are timely filed and 
paid. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
 
4 
                                         
 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this 
decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
 
5 
                                         
 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt 
is documented in his SCA, SOR response, and hearing record. The SOR alleges and 
the record establishes two federal income tax liens filed in 2011, totaling $39,982 and 
Applicant owes federal income taxes for tax years 2009 through 2011. The Government 
established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), and 19(c), requiring additional 
inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.   
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;1 and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
                                            
1The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   
 
6 
                                         
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant’s failure to timely pay his 
federal taxes in full raises a significant security concern. The IRS filed two federal 
income tax liens in 2011, totaling $39,982 and Applicant owes federal income taxes for 
tax years 2009 through 2011. In June 2016, the Applicant and the IRS agreed to settle 
his tax debt for tax years 2008 through 2011 for $11,148. He was credited with payment 
of $2,180 based on his $436 monthly payments from October 2015. His agreement 
requires him to pay $8,533 within five months of May 26, 2016. He did not explain why 
he did not make more progress resolving his tax debts over the last four years. 
Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a 49-year-old satellite technician employed by a defense contractor, 
who is seeking to continue his security clearance. He has been a satellite technician 
 
7 
                                         
 
since 2007. There is no evidence of violations of his employer’s rules, criminal conduct, 
or abuse of alcohol or illegal drugs.     
 
Applicant failed to withhold sufficient funds from his monthly salary for his federal 
income taxes. For tax year 2009, Applicant had only $26 withheld from his pay, and he 
owed $17,256. The IRS filed two federal income tax liens in 2011 against Applicant, 
totaling $39,982. He owes federal income taxes for tax years 2009 through 2011. It is 
unclear how much he owes the IRS. His agreement with the IRS requires him to pay 
$8,533 within five months of May 26, 2016, and if he does so, his federal income tax 
debt will be resolved.  
 
Applicant failed to fully pay his federal income taxes from 2009 through 2011 in 
full when due.2 He has been making periodic payments on his delinquent taxes for 
several years, and the IRS has been intercepting his income tax refunds; however, he 
owes an unspecified amount to the IRS. When an issue of delinquent taxes is involved, 
an administrative judge is required to consider how long an applicant waits to file their 
tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax returns, and how long the applicant waits 
after a tax debt arises to begin and complete making payments.3 The primary problem 
here is that Applicant has owed thousands of dollars to the IRS since 2009. He did not 
prove his inability to make greater progress resolving his tax debts.  
 I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. 
                                            
2See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security 
clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A security clearance represents 
an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor 
other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and 
ability to protect classified information.”). 
 
3See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance 
and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only 
after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated 
himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone 
entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) 
(reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances 
beyond applicant’s control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and 
garnishment of Applicant’s wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); 
ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting 
not all tax returns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More 
recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a 
security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 
2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his 
tax returns and paid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The 
Appeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, 
contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations 
regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax 
returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established government rules 
and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted).

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
