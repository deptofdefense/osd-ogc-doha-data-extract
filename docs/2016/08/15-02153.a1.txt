APPEAL BOARD SUMMARY DISPOSITION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust
position.  On September 22, 2015, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of
the basis for that decision—trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial
Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). 
Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 9, 2016, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Carol G.
Ricciardello denied Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.  Applicant appealed pursuant
to the Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant’s appeal brief contains no assertion of harmful error on the part of the Judge. 
Rather, it contains new evidence in the form of a narrative statement describing Applicant’s current
financial situation and two character reference letters.  Applicant also states that loss of her clearance
will have an adverse impact on her employment.  The Board cannot consider Applicant’s new
evidence on appeal.  See Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  Likewise, we are not permitted to consider the impact
that an adverse decision may have on an applicant.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 14-02496 at 3 (App.
Bd. May 14, 2015).
The Board does not review a case de novo. The Appeal Board’s authority to review a case
is limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the Judge committed harmful error. 
Applicant has not made an allegation of harmful error on the part of the Judge.  Therefore, the
decision of the Judge is AFFIRMED.
