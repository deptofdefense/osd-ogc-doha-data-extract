GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 5, 2012, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP).1  On August 5, 2015, 
the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel 
Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended and modified (Regulation); DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines 
for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the DOD 
on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under 
the Directive. The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to make

an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for occupying a public trust 
position to support a contract with the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 18, 2015. In a sworn 
statement, dated September 1, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
failed to indicate if she wanted a hearing before an administrative judge, stating she “will 
not be able to attend the hearing.” Department Counsel sought clarification regarding 
that comment. On January 27, 2016, Applicant requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge. On December 10, 2015, Department Counsel had previously 
indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to me on 
January 7, 2016. A Notice of Hearing was issued on January 20, 2016. I convened the 
hearing, as scheduled, on February 2, 2016.  
 
 During the hearing, 5 Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 5) and 20 Applicant 
exhibits (AE A-1 through A-6, B, C-1 through C-3, D-1 through D-3, E-1 through E-4, 
and F-1 through F-3) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. 
The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 10, 2016. I kept the record open to enable 
Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity. She timely 
submitted a number of additional documents, which were marked as AE G through AE 
N, and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on February 22, 
2016. 
  
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted five of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.e.) of the SOR. Applicant’s 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been a full-
time claims processor for a defense contractor since May 2004.2 She is seeking to 
retain her eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract with the 
DOD. She has never served in the U.S. military.3 She is a 2000 high school graduate 
with two years of college credits, but no degree.4 Applicant was married in April 2010.5

She has a son, born in 2003 from a prior relationship, as well as two daughters, born in 
2011 and 2014, and a stepdaughter, born in 2007.6 
 
Financial Considerations7 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until sometime mid-2003 
when she went into “preterm labor.” She was forced to drop out of school for complete 
bed rest, and she moved back in with her mother. In dropping out of school, Applicant 
lost her part-time college work-study position. After her son was born, Applicant was 
able to obtain some temporary positions, and she consolidated her student loans and 
started reimbursing her mother for various expenses including daycare, car insurance, 
and car payments.8 The child’s father was also a student, and with his income from the 
military reserve, he helped out financially when he could.9  
 
In 2010, when she got married, Applicant spent an estimated $5,000 (some was 
borrowed money and the remainder was cash) on the wedding.10 At about the same 
time, Applicant’s husband’s truck caught fire and he was unable to work until it was 
repaired.11  
 
During the period July 2011 to September 2011, Applicant went into “preterm 
labor” with her second child and was unable to work.12 Applicant’s third child was born 
with serious health issues.13 In addition to that child’s health issues, Applicant’s son was 
hurt on two occasions at school when he broke a collar bone and later a wrist. Her 
oldest daughter sustained injuries while in daycare. Transporting them to their 
respective medical appointments caused Applicant to lose substantial time from work. 
Applicant also underwent surgery for a condition that kept her from working for six 
weeks in 2012. As a result of continuing issues associated with her condition, as of 
September 2015, Applicant has been permitted to work from home.14

Because of what she described as a “rollercoaster” with her children’s issues and 
missing time at work, Applicant had insufficient funds to keep up with all of her monthly 
payments. A small number of accounts, including two of which she was unaware, 
became delinquent, and they were placed for collection or charged off. Her student 
loans went into default. After learning the extent of her financial issues while being 
interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), 
Applicant contacted her creditors. In August 2015, she sought the assistance of a 
financial coach to establish a debt payoff plan and a budget.15 She now has a budget 
plan that includes her initial “snowball” repayment plans for her small accounts and her 
subsequent repayment plans for her larger accounts.16  
The SOR identified seven purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, totaling 
approximately $23,133, as reflected by the September 2012 credit report,17 the January 
2015 credit report,18 and the September 2015 credit report.19 Those debts and their 
respective current status, according to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by 
the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are 
described below:  
SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b: These are two student loans that were issued by Sallie 
Mae and transferred to a servicing agent, before they went into default. They were 
returned with claims for reimbursement to Sallie Mae. The amounts of both loans were 
unclear because they appear in the credit reports with different balances, depending on 
the listed creditor and the listed reporting agency. The January 2015 credit report lists 
the loan attributed to SOR ¶ 1.a. as having a high credit of $10,770 and a past-due 
amount of $14,246,20 while the September 2015 credit report lists the account with a 
high credit of $10,770 and a past-due balance of $11,646.21 The January 2015 credit 
report lists the loan attributed to SOR ¶ 1.b. as having a high credit of $6,141 and a 
past-due amount of $8,123,22 while the September 2015 credit report lists the account 
with a high credit of $6,141 and a past-due balance of $6,640.23 Applicant contacted the 
most recent listed creditor and set up a repayment plan, and commencing on 
September 2, 2015, she has had automatic monthly withdrawals from her account in the

amount of $20.24 She also contacted the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program 
to seek a repayment plan25 as well as a loan consolidation.26 The loan consolidation 
was completed, and the two loans, in the amounts of $9,395.95 and $5,357.58 – 
amounts far lower than those listed in the credit reports – were consolidated with the 
remaining combined balance of $17,890.73. The accounts are in the process of being 
resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.c.: This is a department store charge account with a credit limit of $300 
and past-due and unpaid balance of $554 that was placed for collection and charged 
off.27 The account was eventually transferred or sold to another entity. Applicant 
contacted the current holder of the account and agreed to a repayment arrangement 
under which she makes monthly payments of $15, commencing in September 2015.28 
The account is in the process of being resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.d.: This is a department store charge account with a $200 credit limit, an 
unpaid balance of $352, and a past-due balance of $79. In early 2015, $446 was 
charged off, and the account was sold to a debt purchaser.29 Applicant contacted the 
debt purchaser and agreed to a repayment arrangement under which, since September 
2015, she has had automatic monthly withdrawals from her account in the amount of 
$26.36.30 The account is in the process of being resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.e.: This is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $215 that was 
placed for collection during a period when Applicant’s son’s medical services were 
covered by Medicare.31 For some reason, Medicare either did not receive the bill or 
failed to pay it. By the time Applicant learned of the situation, the filing time had elapsed, 
and, although the school indicated they would take care of the bill, Medicare had no 
further responsibility.32 Applicant contacted the current holder of the account and agreed 
to a settlement of $141 and a repayment arrangement under which she made an initial

payment of $30 in November 2015, and a final payment of $111 in January 2016.33 The 
account has been resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.f.: This is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $222 that was 
placed for collection in 2009 during a period when Applicant’s son’s medical services 
were covered by Medicare.34 An account under that collection agency’s name or in the 
same amount does not appear in subsequent credit reports. Applicant contends that in 
speaking with a representative of the current holder of the account identified in SOR ¶ 
1.e., it was determined that the two accounts are actually one medical account 
stemming from services provided in 2007 to Applicant’s son when he fractured his wrist. 
The account was purchased by the current holder in December 2013.35 While Applicant 
identified the individual she spoke with, and his telephone number, she failed to submit 
any documentation to support her contention. Nevertheless, in spite of the missing 
documentation, under the circumstances presented (the disappearance of the account 
from subsequent credit reports, the identity and telephone number of the source of the 
information, and Applicant’s explanations), it appears that the two allegations are 
“snapshots” along the timeline of the same account. The account has been resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.g.: This is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $104 that was 
placed for collection during a period when Applicant’s son’s medical services (when he 
broke a collar bone) were covered by Medicare.36 For some reason, Medicare either did 
not receive the bill or failed to pay it. An account under that collection agency’s name or 
in the same amount does not appear in subsequent credit reports. Applicant contends 
that in speaking with a representative of the current holder of the account, it was 
determined that the initial collection agency had been bought out by the current 
collection agency and they had no record of the account. Applicant also spoke with the 
medical billing department of the medical center where the service was provided, and 
they confirmed to her that the bill had, in fact, been paid by Medicare.37 While Applicant 
identified the individuals she spoke with, and their telephone numbers, she failed to 
submit any documentation to support her contention. Nevertheless, in spite of the 
missing documentation, under the circumstances presented (the disappearance of the 
account from subsequent credit reports, the identity and telephone numbers of the 
sources of the information, and Applicant’s explanations), it appears that the account 
has been resolved. 
Applicant’s personal financial statement indicates a net monthly income of 
$1,541.66 as well as $340 for her son’s Social Security Survivor Benefits, for a total of 
$1,881.66 (her husband’s net monthly income fluctuates but is generally $3,363.67); her

normal monthly expenses (reduced because her husband pays a substantial portion of 
their normal monthly expenses) of $776.96; her normal monthly debt (both current and 
delinquent) payments are $722.36, or a total for monthly expenses and debts is 
$1,499.32. Applicant’s husband has no personal debts.38 Not counting her husband’s 
income, Applicant generally has a monthly remainder of $382.34 available for 
discretionary saving or spending.39 She has dedicated herself to becoming financially 
stable, and she is also making monthly payments on a non-SOR delinquent account 
which had an unpaid balance of $120.40 In the absence of any additional unidentified 
delinquencies, it appears that Applicant's financial problems are finally closer to 
becoming under control.  
Work Performance 
Applicant’s supervisors over the past four performance rating periods noted her 
improved performance from “meets expectations” to “consistently exceeds 
expectations.”41  Applicant’s rating on responsibility (accountability for actions, acts in 
the best interests of the company, and acts in a compliant and ethical manner) has 
consistently been “meets expectations.”42 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”43 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. Positions designated as ADP-I and ADP-II are classified as 
“sensitive positions.”44 “The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive 
duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s loyalty, reliability, and 
trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security.”45 Department of Defense contractor

personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any 
final unfavorable access determination may be made.46  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a public trust 
position. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”47 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.48  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  
Furthermore, security clearance determinations, and by inference, public trust 
determinations, should err, if they must, on the side of denials.49 In reaching this

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations 
is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
       
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. 
Under AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially 
disqualifying. Also, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” 
may raise trustworthiness concerns. Applicant’s initial financial problems arose in mid-
2003 when she was forced to drop out of school and relinquish her part-time college 
work-study position. Thereafter, she had insufficient money to maintain all of her 
monthly payments. Various accounts became delinquent. Some of those accounts, both 
SOR and non-SOR, were placed for collection or charged off. Some accounts were sold 
to debt purchasers. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) have been established.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate 
trustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the 
disqualifying condition may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, 
was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.” Also, under AG ¶ 20(b), financial trustworthiness concerns may be mitigated 
where “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the 
person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person has received or is receiving 
counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 
20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”50

AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. AG ¶20(a) does not apply. The nature, 
frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing multi-year period of financial difficulties 
since her 2003 pregnancy make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or 
“was so infrequent.” Applicant was confronted with a number of incidents (difficult 
pregnancies, children’s health issues, her own health issues, periods of unemployment 
or leave without pay, and a truck fire) over which she had little if any control, that 
facilitate the conclusion that those financial issues occurred under such circumstances 
that they are unlikely to recur. However, Applicant’s expenditure of $5,000 for her 
wedding might be considered by some to be excessive under the circumstances. It 
appears that Applicant has, since her marriage, generally altered her spending ways. 
Her somewhat lengthy delay in addressing her delinquent accounts was accompanied 
by repeated unanticipated health-related incidents. She attempted to address her 
student loans several years before the SOR was issued, but that effort was overcome 
by subsequent events.  
 
The receipt of the SOR approximately 12 months ago was, for the most part, the 
motivation or ignition for Applicant’s subsequent corrective actions related to her debts: 
she sought guidance from her financial coach; prioritized her delinquent accounts; set 
up a debt repayment plan; contacted her creditors to establish repayment plans; and 
made agreed payments. Her student loans were consolidated and returned from default 
status. The remaining debts, both SOR and non-SOR, are either resolved or in the 
process of being resolved. It appears that Applicant's financial problems are closer to 
becoming under control. Applicant generally has a monthly remainder of $382.34 
available for discretionary saving or spending. As she resolves some of her debts, she 
can start applying additional funds to her remaining debts. Applicant’s actions no longer 
cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.51 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.52   
     
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. She failed to 
make her monthly payments on a variety of accounts, and they became delinquent, 
resulting in some being charged off. Her student loans went into default.  
 
 The mitigating evidence is more substantial and compelling. There is no 
evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling protected 
information, or substance abuse. Applicant has been with the same employer since May 
2004. Confronted with financial issues following her first pregnancy, Applicant prioritized 
her accounts and minimized expenses by moving in with her mother. Although she was 
beset by a variety of health issues, as well as unemployment and periods of leave 
without pay, she made some efforts to resolve her delinquent accounts. Applicant did 
not conceal her financial difficulties when completing her e-QIP. Instead, she was 
honest and forthright, and she reported them. Finally motivated by receipt of the SOR 
over one year ago, she started to address her debts. Student loans were consolidated 
and returned to current status, repayment plans were established, payments made, and 
her accounts are now either resolved or in the process of being resolved. There are 
clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are closer to becoming under 
control. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
                                                          
52
 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
 
12 
                                      
 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 53 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a good track record of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts, limited only by her modest earnings as a result of a series of issues 
over which she had little control. Nevertheless, because Applicant is currently in the 
process of resolving her remaining debts, this decision should serve as a warning that 
Applicant’s failure to continue her debt resolution efforts pertaining to those remaining 
accounts, or the actual accrual of new delinquent debts, will adversely affect her future 
eligibility for a position of public trust.54  
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a position of public trust. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.:  For Applicant

 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant as security officials may continue to monitor 
her finances, this decision, including the warning, should not be interpreted as a conditional eligibility to hold a 
position of public trust to support a contract with DOD. The Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at 
any time through credit reports, investigation, and interrogatories. Approval of a position of public trust now does not 
bar the Government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the 
security [or trustworthiness] significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having 
negative security [or trustworthiness] significance.” Nevertheless, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) has no authority to attach limiting conditions, such as an interim, conditional, or probationary status, to an 
applicant’s eligibility for a position of public trust. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. 
Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006); ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. 
June 30, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-17410 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0109 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar.

Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility to 
occupy a public trust position to support a contract with DOD.  Eligibility is granted.
