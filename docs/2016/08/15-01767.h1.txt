Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny him eligibility for
access to classified information. The evidence is sufficient to explain and mitigate
Applicant’s financial problems or difficulties. Accordingly, this case is decided for
Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on July 1, 2014.  Thereafter, on November 20, 2015, after1
reviewing the application and information gathered during a background investigation,
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).     
 Exhibits 1 and 2. 4
 Exhibit M. 5
 Exhibit N. 6

the Department of Defense (DOD)  sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR),2
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to a3
complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline
known as Guideline F for financial considerations. He  answered the SOR on December
24, 2015, and requested a hearing.          
The case was assigned to me on March 2, 2016. The hearing was held as
scheduled on April 12, 2016. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1–4, and they were
admitted. Applicant presented one witness, testified on his own behalf, and offered
Exhibits A–P, and they were admitted. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received
on April 22, 2016. 
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 52-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance
that he has held without an adverse incident since 1987 or 1988 while working for
various companies in the defense industry.  His education includes a bachelor’s degree4
in electrical engineering. He is currently employed as an engineer, and his work involves
testing and evaluating communication and weapons’ systems. He has worked for his
current employer since June 2015, with a salary of $82,000 annually.  His annual salary5
is now $110,000.6
Applicant married in 1982, separated near the end of 2004, and divorced in 2005.
Applicant and his former spouse have three adult children. He and his former spouse
reconciled and have been living together since December 2011. He has a history of
financial problems or difficulties that he attributes to a difficult and costly divorce, court-
ordered support payments, and providing financial support to his children and former

spouse above the court-ordered requirements.  He also used credit cards to fund a7
business during 2004–2008, when it failed. 
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges ten collection or charged-off accounts for a
total of about $58,000, although several of the charged-off accounts have no dollar
amounts alleged. Applicant disclosed several delinquent accounts in his 2014 security
clearance application.  He provided additional details about his financial record and8
delinquent accounts during his 2014 background investigation.  The SOR allegations9
are established by Department Counsel’s documentary evidence as well as Applicant’s
admissions in his answer to the SOR and his hearing testimony. 
The evidence establishes that two student loan accounts were rehabilitated and
are in good standing; five accounts were paid or settled; one account is in repayment
with a large balance; and two accounts have unknown creditors. The ten accounts are
discussed further below.
SOR ¶ 1.a–charged-off account. This debt stems from a student loan for
$10,000 Applicant obtained for one of his sons in 2005.  Applicant successfully10
rehabilitated the loan, the creditor removed the record of default from the loan in 2013,
and the loan is current and up to date.  He estimated the current balance at about11
$1,800.12
SOR ¶ 1.b–$26,116 charged-off account. This debt stems from an unsecured
line of credit Applicant obtained in about 2007 or 2008 for business and family
expenses.  He had multiple conversations with the creditor and they indicated they13
were not interested in establishing a formal repayment arrangement because the debt
was charged off. Nonetheless, he has made monthly payments in varying amounts
($200, $150, or $100) since December 2015. He estimated the current balance at about
$25,580.  The goal is to reduce the balance owed to about $10,000 and then ask the14
creditor to cancel or forgive the balance due.

charge card account.  Applicant paid it in full in September 2014.18 19

account that was turned over to a collection agency. The account was satisfied in full in

SOR ¶ 1.h–$2,363 charged-off account. This debt stems from a credit card
account opened in about early 2007. The debt was subsequently reduced to a civil
judgment for $2,446 in June 2010. Applicant paid $2,800 to satisfy the judgment in
March 2015.21
SOR ¶ 1.i–$13,540 collection account. This debt stems from a student loan
Applicant cosigned for a son.  Applicant was unaware that the loan was delinquent until22
his 2014 background investigation. The loan became delinquent when his son was laid
off from a job. His son has resumed making payments on the loan, and the loan is
current and up to date.

Applicant has a good employment record and the full support of his senior project
manager.  He also has the full support of his former spouse and three adult children, all25
of whom submitted letters on his behalf. Taken together, the letters described Applicant
as a dedicated family man, before and after the divorce, whose financial contributions to
his former spouse and children went well beyond what was required by the court
order.  The financial support extended to paying for expensive extracurricular activities26
for two of the children. Most recent, his financial support extended to his youngest child,
a daughter, to help her obtain a nursing degree, which was recently completed.  He27
estimated having $10,000 to $11,000 in his checking account, and he is contributing to
a 401(k) account.  His financial situation is continuing to improve as reflected by his28
credit score increasing 91 points from April 2015 to March 2016.29
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As30
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt31
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An32

unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  33
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting34
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An35
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate36
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  37
In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a
preponderance of the evidence.  The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s38
reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence
standard.39
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it40
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.

financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In

Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant41
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 42
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  43
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties as well as inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.  I44
considered the six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and the following are most45
pertinent:
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
AG ¶ 20(c) [t]here are clear indications that the problem is being resolved
or is under control; and 
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).46
8
Applicant did not present a perfect case, but the evidence is sufficient to explain
and mitigate the concern stemming from his financial problems or difficulties. First, it is
evident that Applicant’s history of financial problems or difficulties were brought about
by conditions largely beyond his control; namely, the separation and divorce in
2004–2005, the court-ordered financial support obligations for his spouse and children,
and the business failure in 2008. Second, the evidence shows that he made a
reasonable effort to resolve his delinquent debts. For the ten accounts in the SOR, the
evidence establishes that two student loan accounts were rehabilitated and are in good
standing; five accounts were paid or settled; one account is in repayment with a large
balance; and two accounts have unknown creditors. Those are not the actions of a
financially irresponsible person. 
Granted, Applicant should have acted sooner to address these matters. But the
timing of his remedial actions does not cancel out or wholly negate his efforts to
rehabilitate his financial record. In any event, his payment record is sufficient to
establish a meaningful track record of actual debt reduction. It also shows that it is likely
that he will continue working to resolve the charged-off account with the large balance in
SOR ¶ 1.b. 
Applicant’s history of financial problems or difficulties does not create doubt
about his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect
classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice
versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.  In that regard, I46
gave favorable consideration to his good employment record; his long record of holding
a security clearance without an adverse incident; his difficult marital circumstances
resulting in a separation in 2004, a divorce in 2005, and then a reconciliation in 2011;
and his strong commitment to provide financial support for his wife and children beyond
what was required by the court order, although that hindered his ability to address his
lawful debts. Accordingly, I conclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to
show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for
access to classified information.

Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
