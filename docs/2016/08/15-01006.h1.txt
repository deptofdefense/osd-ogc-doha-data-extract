Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny him eligibility for
access to classified information. The evidence is sufficient to explain and mitigate
Applicant’s financial problems or difficulties. Accordingly, this case is decided for
Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on July 21, 2014.  Thereafter, on November 30, 2015, after1
reviewing the application and information gathered during a background investigation,
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).     
 Exhibit 1. 4
2
the Department of Defense (DOD)  sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR),2
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to a3
complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline
known as Guideline F for financial considerations. He  answered the SOR on January 4,
2016, and requested a hearing.          
The case was assigned to me on March 2, 2016. The hearing was held as
scheduled on April 12, 2016. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1–6, and they were
admitted. Applicant testified on his own behalf and offered Exhibits A–J, and they were
admitted. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on April 21, 2016. 
The record was kept open for 30 days until May 12, 2016, to allow Applicant to
submit additional information concerning his child-support obligation. He made two
timely submissions, and those five documentary matters are admitted without objections
as Exhibits K–O. 
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 30-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security
clearance. His background includes honorable service (active reserve) in the U.S.
Marine Corps during 2004–2011. He made two deployments to Iraq during that period.
Thereafter, he attended a technical college from January 2011 to January 2013, and he
was awarded an associate’s degree in information systems and security. He attended
another school during July–August 2013, and he was awarded a commercial driver’s
license (CDL) certificate. He is currently employed as an electronics technician for a
company doing business in the defense industry. He has worked for this company from
March 2014 to present, although he had two short periods of employment with the same
company in 2013.  4
Applicant has never married, and he currently lives with the mother of his son,
who was born in 2012. He also has a daughter, born in 2005, and the child lives with
her mother in a city a substantial distance (10 to 11 hours by car) from Applicant. He
has a child-support obligation to his daughter, he has been delinquent in the past, and
he disclosed a judgment for past-due child support in his 2014 security clearance

application. In addition to the child-support matter, the SOR alleges three collection or
charged-off accounts for a total of $3,433. These four matters are discussed below.
SOR ¶ 1.a–$1,664 collection account. This debt stems from Applicant’s
attendance at the school in 2013 to obtain the CDL certificate.  He has not made any5
payments on this account. It is unresolved according to Applicant’s April 2016 credit
report.  6
SOR ¶ 1.b–$1,657 charged-off account. This debt stems from a credit card
account that went into default.  He has not made any payments on this account. It is7
unresolved according to Applicant’s April 2016 credit report.8
In December 2015, Applicant entered into an agreement with a credit-repair firm
to address his indebtedness with the intention of paying off the two debts mentioned
above.  The plan calls for him to make $195.50 monthly payments for 12 months to the9
firm in exchange for debt-management counseling services in negotiating a repayment
plan with individual creditors. He had not made any payments on the plan as of April
2016.10
SOR ¶ 1.c–$112 collection account. This debt stems from an apartment lease,
and Applicant paid it in December 2015.  11
SOR ¶ 1.d–$11,906 judgment for a child-support enforcement agency in
2010. As mentioned above, Applicant has an ongoing child-support obligation for his
daughter born in 2005. The child-support order began in 2007. He is currently ordered
to pay a total of $473 monthly as follows: $265 for ongoing child support; $135 for the
child-support judgment or arrears; and $73 for medical support payment.12
Two judgments for child-support arrears were obtained against Applicant. The
first judgment, as alleged in the SOR, was obtained in July 2010 for $11,906.13

Apparently, the judgment was obtained after an arrearage had accumulated. It appears
that judgment has been resolved and any balance due was included in the second
judgment.  The judgment was recently deleted from Applicant’s credit history according14
to his April 2016 credit report.  15
The second judgment, which is not alleged in the SOR, was obtained in June
2013 for $14,060 for child-support arrears.  The judgment was entered during the16
course of a case to modify child support and custody between Applicant and the child’s
mother. The court ordered Applicant to pay $265 per month for child support beginning
in June 2013.  The court also found Applicant was in arrears for $14,060, which17
included all unpaid child support and any balance owed on previously confirmed arrears
or retroactive support judgment.  The court ordered Applicant to pay $135 per month18
for the arrears beginning in June 2013. 
The official payment record shows that Applicant paid a total of $17,971 for child
support from January 2007 to April 2013.  He then paid a total of $24,495 for child19
support from May 2013 to April 2016.  The payment record includes a lump-sum20
payment of about $3,014 in March 2016 stemming from a $3,000 bond payment
Applicant made in June 2015 when he failed to appear for a mandatory court
appearance.  The bond payment was subsequently applied to the child support. 21
Applicant reduced the child-support arrears from $14,060 in April 2013 to $3,498
as of April 2016.  He has made the full monthly child-support payment ($475) since22
February 2014, which is about the same time he began his current employment.  In23
total, the official payment record shows Applicant paid about $42,466 for child support
from January 2007 to April 2016.  At $135 per month (plus interest), he should repay24
arrears of $3,498 in about 26 months or so.

Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As25
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt26
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An27
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  28
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting29
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An30
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate31
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  32
In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a
preponderance of the evidence.  The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s33
reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence
standard.34

 ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that “the security suitability of an applicant37
is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness or recurring
financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In
security clearance cases, “the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances
surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation
omitted). 
 AG ¶ 18.  38
 AG ¶¶ 19(a) and (c).39

The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it35
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant36
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 37
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  38
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties as well as inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.  That39
 AG ¶ 20(a)–(f).40
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).41
7
conclusion is supported by the documentary evidence that establishes the child-support
arrears and the three other delinquent debts.  
 I considered the six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and the following40
are most pertinent:
AG ¶ 20(c) [t]here are clear indications that the problem is being resolved
or is under control; and 
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
Applicant did not present a perfect case, but the evidence is sufficient to explain
and mitigate the concern stemming from his financial problems, which consists primarily
of child-support arrears. The evidence shows that he is making a concerted effort to
meet his child-support obligation and support his own family concurrently, which can be
a difficult task. The best evidence on this point is the following: (1) he paid $24,495 in
child-support payments during the last three years; (2) he reduced an arrearage of more
than $14,000 to less than $3,500 in the same period; and (3) he paid the total amount of
about $42,466 in  child-support payments from January 2007 to April 2016. His payment
record is sufficient to establish a meaningful track record of actual debt reduction. It also
shows that it is likely that he will continue making the child-support payments. In
addition, he paid off the minor $112 collection account. Those are not the actions of a
financially irresponsible person. And, unlike many applicants in Guideline F cases, he
did a good job of providing documentation in support of his case. 
Applicant’s case is less than perfect because two delinquent debts remain wholly
unresolved. But he did obtain the services of a credit-repair firm to assist him. The two
debts are for less than $3,500, which is not a large amount of money. He should be able
to pay off or settle those accounts in the foreseeable future.   
Applicant’s history of financial problems or difficulties does not create doubt
about his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect
classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice
versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.  In that regard, I41
gave special consideration to his honorable military service, which included two
deployments to Iraq. Accordingly, I conclude that he met his ultimate burden of
persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him
eligibility for access to classified information.
