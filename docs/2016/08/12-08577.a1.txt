APPEAL BOARD SUMMARY DISPOSITION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On
August 13, 2015, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision—security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. 
On May 17, 2016, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)
Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance. 
Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant’s appeal brief contains assertions that her employers were negligent in the
processing of her security clearance, and one employer committed a breach of employment.  In
supported of her claims, she provided a number of documents that were not previously submitted
to the Judge.  The Appeal Board can neither receive nor consider such new evidence.  See Directive
¶ E3.1.29.  
The Board does not review a case de novo.  Besides the assertions involving her employers,
we are unable to determine with any degree of certitude exactly what error Applicant is raising.  An
appealing party must state with sufficient specificity what it is about a Judge’s decision that he or
she believes to be erroneous so as to enable the Appeal Board to address the assignment of error. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05920 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 8, 2016).  Because Applicant has not raised
an allegation of harmful error on the part of the Judge, the decision is AFFIRMED.
