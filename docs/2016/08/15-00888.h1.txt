HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s state and federal tax returns were not timely filed for several years, 
and he has owed the state and federal tax authorities thousands of dollars since 2010. 
In the last three years, he has made some progress; however, he is unsure whether all 
of his state tax returns have been filed, and he does not know how much he owes the 
state and federal government for delinquent taxes. Financial considerations security 
concerns are not mitigated. Access to classified information is denied.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On April 12, 2012, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86) (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On November 27, 2015, 
the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an 
SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 
2, 1992; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 
2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
 
2 
                                         
 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the 
SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. 
 
On February 1, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR. On April 6, 2016, 
Applicant requested a hearing. (Transcript (Tr.) 16) On April 6, 2016, Department 
Counsel was ready to proceed. On May 24, 2016, the case was assigned to me. On 
June 6, 2016, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of 
hearing, setting the hearing for June 22, 2016. (HE 1) Applicant waived his right to 15 
days of notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing. (Tr. 19-20) The hearing was 
held as scheduled on June 22, 2016.  
  
Department Counsel offered four exhibits, and Applicant offered three exhibits, 
which were admitted into evidence without objection. (Tr. 27-31; Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1-4; Applicant Exhibit (AE) 1-3) On June 29, 2016, DOHA received a copy of the 
transcript of the hearing. On August 2, 2016, Applicant provided one post-hearing 
exhibit consisting of 18 pages including forwarding emails, which were admitted without 
objection. (AE D pg. 1-18)  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations. He also 
provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted 
as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 55 years old, and he has been employed by a defense contractor as 
an analyst and technical writer for six years. (Tr. 5; GE 1; AE A) In 1978, he graduated 
from high school. (Tr. 6) He served in the Air Force from 1979 to 2000. (Tr. 6-11) He 
honorably retired from the Air Force as a master sergeant (E-7). (Tr. 10) He served in 
Southwest Asia, and he received numerous awards including the Meritorious Service 
Medal, Air Force Commendation Medals, and Good Conduct Medals. (Tr. 10) His last 
few years were in the Air Force Reserve, and he will not be able to receive retirement 
pay until age 60. (Tr. 12) In 2000, he received an associate’s degree in flight 
engineering. (Tr. 6)  
 
In 1995, he married, and in 1997, he divorced. (Tr. 12; GE 1) In 1999, he 
married, and he has been separated from his current spouse for three years. (Tr. 13) 
His stepchildren are adults, and his 16-year-old daughter lives with his spouse. (Tr. 13)   
 
Applicant has been unemployed since May 1, 2016. (Tr. 32, 34) He is receiving 
$359 weekly unemployment compensation, and this amount is too low for him to 
address his SOR debts. (Tr. 33, 36) His child support responsibility for his 16-year-old 
daughter is $1,140 monthly; however, this payment is not court ordered. (Tr. 36-37) 
Applicant has been borrowing from family to make ends meet until his employment 
resumes. (Tr. 42-43)

Financial Considerations 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a bank debt for $4,590, and SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a bank debt for 
$626. Applicant did not make any payments to address these two debts. (Tr. 32) The 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.a resulted from the voluntary repossession of his vehicle, and the debt 
in SOR ¶ 1.b is from a credit card. (Tr. 33, 40)  
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e allege three state tax liens that were entered against 
Applicant in the following years and amounts: 2010 for $46,470; 2013 for $12,582; and 
2013 for $6,163. 
   
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges Applicant failed to file his state tax returns for tax years 2003 
through 2010, and SOR ¶ 1.g alleges he failed to file his federal income tax returns for 
tax years 2007 through 2010. Applicant was unclear on when his federal and state tax 
returns were filed. (Tr. 45-46) At the time of his September 12, 2012 Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant had not filed his federal 
and state income tax returns for 2007 through 2010. (Tr. 47-48; AE C at 5) He 
estimated that he filed his federal tax returns in 2012 or 2013. (Tr. 46, 51, 58) The SOR 
does not allege Applicant owes federal income taxes; however, Applicant said the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) garnished $540 monthly from his pay for several years. 
(Tr. 49, 57) Applicant believes the IRS is satisfied with the current payment plan. (Tr. 
49) He estimated the IRS has garnished about $16,000 over the last three years to 
address his tax debt. (Tr. 56-57) 
 
In April 2016, Applicant hired a tax service to file his state tax returns; however, 
as of the date of his hearing his state tax returns were not filed. (Tr. 52; AE B) He 
agreed to pay the tax service $500 monthly from April 2016 to March 2017 or a total of 
$6,500 to help with his tax issues. (AE B) He was unsure about which years he failed to 
file his state tax returns. (Tr. 52, 61) He estimated he owes about $70,000 in delinquent 
taxes. (Tr. 53; AE B) He was unaware of whether the tax service had taken any action 
on Applicant’s behalf. (Tr. 56) He may have to stop payments to the tax service until he 
becomes employed. (Tr. 55-56) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the 
Bankruptcy Code in September 2000, and in April 11, 2003, his bankruptcy was 
dismissed. Applicant explained his bankruptcy was dismissed because he was able to 
pay his bills, and there was no need to continue the bankruptcy. (Tr. 44) 
 
Applicant’s federal income tax transcript for tax year 2014 shows: his tax return 
was received on May 3, 2016; his income was $85,760; his income tax was $14,863; 
and his refund was $2,004. (AE D at 11-13) Applicant’s federal income tax transcript for 
tax year 2015 shows: his tax return was received on May 3, 2016; his income was 
$86,566; his income tax was $14,763; and his refund was $1,944. (AE D at 11-13) 
 
Applicant attributed his financial problems to delay in filing his tax returns and 
substantial variations in his income. (Tr. 24, 66) He emphasized he had a payment plan 
with the IRS for his federal taxes, and he has taken steps to bring his state taxes to 
 
4 
                                         
 
current status. (Tr. 23) He has reduced his expenses. (Tr. 25) He has contributed to his 
country for 38 years. (Tr. 25, 67) He promised to endeavor to pay his remaining tax 
debt. (Tr. 66) He understands the requirement to maintain his financial responsibility. 
(Tr. 66) He is a loyal employee who is professional and competent. (Tr. 24-26) 
Applicant’s program manager has known Applicant for six years, and he lauded 
Applicant’s loyalty, diligence, and competence. (AE A) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
 
5 
                                         
 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;” and “(g) failure to file annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required . . . .” Applicant admitted that he 
failed to timely file his federal and state tax returns, and he owes state and federal 
income taxes. He has two additional delinquent debts totaling about $5,000. The 
Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) 
requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
6 
                                         
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;1 and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
No mitigating conditions apply; however, Applicant presented some mitigating 
information. He had variations in his income, and he became unemployed around May 
1, 2016. These unusual circumstances were beyond Applicant’s control and caused or 
contributed to Applicant’s financial problems. Applicant’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy was 
dismissed in 2003, and Applicant was able to pay his debts. Applicant is credited with 
mitigating the financial allegation in SOR ¶ 1.h.      
                                            
1The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   
 
7 
                                         
 
Applicant failed to withhold sufficient funds from his salary to pay his share of his 
federal and state income taxes. He failed to timely file his state and federal tax returns. 
The DOHA Appeal Board has commented: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. 
Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for 
protecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is 
not directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 
(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward 
inducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at 
evaluating an applicant’s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails 
repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the 
high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted 
access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 
(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union 
Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 
886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 
2002)). ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board 
clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the 
applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent 
such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant’s 
security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing 
irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR 
Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, 
no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employed an “all’s well that 
ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified 
information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
Applicant paid about $16,000 through garnishment of his pay to address his 
federal income tax debt. He hired a tax service to help with his taxes and to find out 
whether he needs to file some state tax returns. Notwithstanding these positive 
developments, there are too many unanswered questions about Applicant’s tax 
situation. It is unclear how much he owes the state and federal government, and it is 
unclear whether he has filed all of his state tax returns. Financial considerations 
concerns are not mitigated.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
8 
                                         
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is 55 years old, and he has been employed by a defense contractor as 
an analyst and technical writer for six years. He served in the Air Force from 1979 to 
2000. He honorably retired from the Air Force as a master sergeant. He served in 
Southwest Asia, and he received numerous awards including the Meritorious Service 
Medal, Air Force Commendation Medals, and Good Conduct Medals. In 2000, he 
received an associate’s degree in flight engineering.   
  
Three state tax liens were entered against Applicant in 2010 for $46,470, in 2013 
for $12,582, and in 2013 for $6,163. He failed to timely file his state tax returns for tax 
years 2003 through 2010, and he failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for 
tax years 2007 through 2010. About $16,000 has been garnished from his pay over the 
previous three years to address his federal income tax arrearage.2  His history of failing 
to fully pay his federal and state income taxes when due raises unresolved financial 
considerations security concerns. He owes an unspecified amount of state and federal 
income taxes.3 When an issue of delinquent taxes is involved, an administrative judge is 
                                            
2Of course, Applicant loses some mitigating credit because some debt payments were made 
through garnishment of his salary even though his opportunity to establish a payment plan was limited 
because of lack of income and other financial commitments. Payment of a debt “though garnishment 
rather than a voluntary effort diminishes its mitigating force.” Compare ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 4 
(App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2010) with ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (payment of two 
of four debts through garnishment did not bar mitigation of financial considerations concerns). See also 
ISCR Case No. 09-05700 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011) (garnished payments towards delinquent tax 
debts is not mitigating information in light of other factors); ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 
21, 2009) (remanding the case to the administrative judge and stating when addressing an Internal 
Revenue Service garnishment, “On its face, satisfaction of a debt through the involuntary establishment 
of a creditor’s garnishment is not the same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the 
debtor.”). 
  
3See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security 
clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A security clearance represents 
an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor 
other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and 
ability to protect classified information.”).

required to consider how long an applicant waits to file their tax returns, whether the IRS 
generates the tax returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to 
begin and complete making payments.4 The primary problem here is that Applicant has 
owed thousands of dollars to the IRS and state since 2010. He did not prove his inability 
to make greater progress resolving his tax debts.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated.

recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a 
security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 
2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his 
tax returns and paid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The 
Appeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, 
contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations 
regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax 
returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established government rules 
and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
