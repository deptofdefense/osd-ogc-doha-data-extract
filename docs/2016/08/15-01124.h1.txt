GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 30, 2012, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On August 5, 2015, 
the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel 
Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended and modified (Regulation); DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines 
for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the DOD 
on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under 
the Directive. The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to make

an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for occupying a public trust 
position to support a contract with the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 28, 2015. In a sworn 
statement, dated September 14, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On December 10, 2015, 
Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was 
assigned to me on January 7, 2016. A Notice of Hearing was issued on January 20, 
2016. I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on February 2, 2016.  
 
 During the hearing, five Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 5) and one 
administrative exhibit were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. 
The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 10, 2016. I kept the record open to enable 
Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity and submitted 
five Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE E) that were admitted into evidence without 
objection. The record closed on February 24, 2016. 
  
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted a number of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a., 1.c., 1.g., 1.h., 1.k. through 1.m., 1.p., and 
1.r.) of the SOR. She denied the remaining allegations. Applicant’s admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been a 
claims processor for a defense contractor since October 2012. She is seeking to retain 
her eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract with the DOD. 
She received a General Educational Development (GED) diploma in 1988.2 She has 
never served in the U.S. military.3 Applicant was married to her first husband in 1989, 
separated in 1990, and divorced in 1991. They reconciled and remarried in 1993, but 
were eventually divorced again in 2000. She married her current husband in 2001 and 
they separated about a year before the hearing.4 She has a daughter, born in 1991, and 
two sons, born in 1990 and 1994.5

Financial Considerations6 
 
When Applicant divorced her first husband for the second time in 2000, she was 
already $45,000 in debt.7 When she married her current husband, he too had earlier 
support obligations (characterized as child support, but actually alimony because he 
had no children) to his first wife in the amount of $45,000, to be paid $450 per month.8 
Nevertheless, according to Applicant, there was nothing unusual about her finances 
until August 2007. She and her husband were both employed, and they generally 
maintained all their accounts in a current status. Things apparently changed around that 
time for Applicant initially stated that her financial problems started in August 2007.9 
She failed to elaborate on the nature or causes of those financial problems. In her e-
QIP, Applicant listed periods of unemployment: July 2009 until September 2009; 
October 2009 until February 2010; and June 2010 until June 2012.10 During her October 
2012 interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM), Applicant noted that her husband – a pipefitter – was also unemployed from 
2009 until June 2012.11 Those periods of unemployment meant Applicant and her family 
did not have health insurance. Another factor negatively impacting her finances is 
Applicant having to take leave without pay because of the progression of her 
Parkinson’s Disease which impacts her day-to-day ability to do things, also causing her 
difficulty with speaking and walking, as well as to involuntarily throw things, cry, and 
easily get emotional.12  
 
As a result of the above factors, including the reduction in family income and loss 
of health insurance, Applicant was unable to maintain her accounts in a current status. 
She was forced to prioritize her accounts, and she chose to address what she called the 
“essentials of life” – food, water, rent, utilities, etc., first – with other accounts next. She 
failed to timely file her state income tax return for the tax year 2010.13 Accounts became 
delinquent and were placed for collection, charged off, or went to judgment. A vehicle 
was repossessed. A state tax lien and a judgment lien were also filed. Many accounts 
were sold to debt purchasers. When questioned by the OPM investigator about her 
delinquent accounts, Applicant acknowledged most of them, and she indicated: (1) she 
had some repayment plans in place, and (2) she hoped to have repayment plans

established for other known accounts by early 2013. As for the accounts that she did 
not recognize, she stated she would dispute all such accounts, and if they turn out to be 
her accounts, she would also try to set up repayment arrangements by early 2013.14  
The SOR identified 18 purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, totaling 
approximately $15,812, as reflected by the September 2012 credit report,15 the January 
2015 credit report,16 and the October 2015 credit report.17 Applicant’s Answer to the 
SOR included responses to a number of those accounts that differed from her 
explanations given during her OPM interview. Some accounts that she had 
acknowledged during the interview were no longer recognized by her in her Answer to 
the SOR. During the hearing, some positions and explanations again changed. All of the 
debts and their respective current status, according to the credit reports, other evidence 
submitted by the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding 
same, are described below:  
SOR ¶ 1.a.: This is a state tax lien in the amount of $331 that was filed against 
Applicant in June 2010. Applicant claimed that in October 2012 she agreed to a 
repayment plan under which she would make monthly payments of $50 commencing in 
November 2012. Applicant’s husband was supposed to make the payments, but 
Applicant was not sure if he ever did so. Furthermore, when she finally asked him about 
the payments, he admitted that he had forgotten about them.18 As of the closing of the 
record, no documentation indicating either a repayment plan or payments had been 
submitted to me by Applicant. The account remains unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.b.: This is a judgment in the amount of $257 that Applicant initially 
identified as the unpaid balance on a loan for the purchase of a 2004 Jeep that was 
repossessed in 2009.19 She subsequently denied having any knowledge of the debt.20 
During the hearing, she acknowledged that she had not made any effort to identify the 
creditor.21 The account remains unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.c.: This is an automobile loan with a high credit of $17,440 that was 
placed for collection and charged off in the amount of $9,417. The account was

transferred or sold to another collection agent.22 Applicant initially could not identify the 
account, the creditor, or the collection agent,23 but subsequently acknowledged the loan 
was for an automobile that she eventually voluntarily returned in 2013 because her 
medical condition made it difficult for her to drive. The vehicle was to be sold by the 
creditor, and she was to be responsible for the remaining unpaid balance. During the 
hearing, she gave inconsistent stories regarding contacting the creditor. First she 
acknowledged that she had not made any effort to contact the creditor,24 but then she 
said she had.25 The account remains unresolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d., 1.e., 1.j., 1.n., and 1.o.: These are medical accounts with unpaid 
balances of $2,535, $1,709, $210, $93, and $55. At one point, Applicant denied 
knowing anything about some of the debts. During her OPM interview in October 2012, 
Applicant said she would contact the creditors and resolve as many of the accounts as 
possible. She failed to do so, claiming that the progression of her illness prevented her 
from following up on her promise.26 With the exception of the one account for $210 (for 
which Applicant claimed she made payments of $25 starting in August 2012),27 
Applicant offered no evidence of any contacts, repayment arrangements, or payments 
pertaining to any of the accounts. As to the one account for which payments were 
claimed, she failed to submit any documentation to support her claim. The accounts 
remain unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.f.: This is a furniture store charge account with a credit limit of $740 and 
a past-due balance of $300 that was placed for collection.28 Applicant contended she 
had paid the account in full,29 but she failed to submit any documentation to support her 
contention. The account remains unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.g.: This is a bank credit card account with a credit limit of $300 and a 
past-due balance of $514 that was placed for collection and charged off.30 Applicant 
initially claimed that she had paid off the entire balance in October 2012.31 She 
subsequently stated that when she moved she never received another statement from

the creditor. Since she received the SOR, Applicant has made no effort to resolve the 
remaining unpaid balance.32 The account remains unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.h.: This is an unspecified type of loan account with an unpaid balance of 
$312 that was placed for collection and charged off.33  Applicant purportedly contacted 
the collection agent “the other day” and was advised that the remaining balance had 
been reduced to $157.34 She offered no testimonial or documentary evidence of having 
entered into any repayment arrangements or making any payments. The account 
remains unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.i.: This is a clothing store charge account with a credit limit of $100 and 
a high credit of $297 that was placed for collection and charged off in October 2011. 
The account was sold to a debt purchaser.35 Applicant could not identify the account, 
the creditor, or the eventual debt purchaser.36 The account remains unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.k.: This is a credit card account with an unpaid balance of $202 that 
was placed for collection and charged off in October 2009.37 Applicant said she 
contacted the creditor in 2012 and gave them her new address. She acknowledged that 
she has not been in contact with the creditor since 2012.38 The account remains 
unresolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.l. and 1.r.: These are two cellular telephone accounts with unpaid 
balances of $200 (an account for Applicant’s daughter) and $602 (an account for 
Applicant) that were placed for collection.39 Applicant offered no testimonial or 
documentary evidence of having entered into any repayment arrangements or making 
any payments for either account. The accounts remain unresolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.m. and 1.p.: These are two credit card accounts with unpaid balances 
of $196 and $454 that were placed for collection and charged off.40 Applicant offered no 
testimonial or documentary evidence of having entered into any repayment 
arrangements or making any payments for either account. The accounts remain 
unresolved.

SOR ¶ 1.q.: This is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid and past-due 
balance of $326 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser.41 Applicant 
initially claimed to have no knowledge of the account, but subsequently claimed that it 
was one of the accounts for which she was responsible after her second divorce from 
her first husband.42 Applicant offered no testimonial or documentary evidence of having 
entered into any repayment arrangements or making any payments for the account. The 
account remains unresolved. 
During a good month, when she is not too sick to work, Applicant’s net monthly 
income, including salary and spousal assistance, is generally $1,350. Her normal 
monthly expenses, including expenses for her unemployed daughter’s mental health 
issues, her daughter’s boyfriend, and her granddaughter, is $1,359.43 That leaves 
Applicant with a negative remainder of $9, with insufficient funds to make any payments 
towards her delinquent accounts.  Applicant does not maintain a budget, and she simply 
pays bills if she can do so.44 When asked what her plan was to resolve her accounts, 
Applicant responded that she wanted to pay her bills. She was advised that her 
statement constituted a desire, not an established plan. When afforded the opportunity 
to supplement the record with documentation supporting her contentions that repayment 
plans had been established; that payments were made to creditors both listed in the 
SOR as well as other unlisted creditors; that disputes had been filed; that additional 
contacts with creditors had been made; that a budget had been created; or that financial 
counseling had been received, she failed to follow up on that opportunity. It appears that 
Applicant's financial problems are not any closer to becoming under control.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”46 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national

security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. Positions designated as ADP-I and ADP-II are classified as 
“sensitive positions.”47 “The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive 
duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s loyalty, reliability, and 
trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security.”48 Department of Defense contractor 
personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any 
final unfavorable access determination may be made.49  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a public trust 
position. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”50 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.51  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to

repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  
Furthermore, security clearance determinations, and by inference, public trust 
determinations, should err, if they must, on the side of denials.52 In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations 
is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
       
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. 
Under AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially 
disqualifying. Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” 
may raise trustworthiness concerns. Although Applicant claimed that her financial 
problems did not start until August 2007, they actually started in 2000, when she was 
already $45,000 in debt following her second divorce from her first husband. At some 
point, Applicant had insufficient money to maintain all of her monthly payments. Various 
accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection, charged off, or sent to 
judgment. Some accounts were sold to debt purchasers. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) have 
been established.   
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate 
trustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the 
disqualifying condition may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, 
was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.” Also, under AG ¶ 20(b), financial trustworthiness concerns may be mitigated 
where “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the 
person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical

emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person has received or is receiving 
counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 
20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”53 In addition, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply 
if “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt 
which is the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
 
AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do not apply. 
The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties since 
at least 2007 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so 
infrequent.” It is clear that Applicant’s and her current husband’s periods of 
unemployment, as well as her health conditions, created financial hardships that made it 
difficult to maintain her accounts in a current status. She was forced to prioritize her 
accounts, and she chose to address what she called the “essentials of life” first, with 
other accounts next. Accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection, 
charged off, or went to judgment. Many were sold to debt purchasers.  
 
Applicant offered no documentary evidence of a good-faith effort to resolve any 
of her accounts. She contended she entered into some repayment arrangements and 
made some payments, but failed to submit any documentation such as receipts, 
cancelled checks, account records, etc., to support her contentions. There is no 
evidence that Applicant took any positive action to resolve her accounts either before or 
since her October 2012 OPM interview. Over the years, she failed to pay or resolve 
accounts with balances as low as $55, $93, $196, and $200.  
 
Without even superficial examination of some of the accounts, Applicant merely 
“disputed” them because accounts with a particular identified creditor, debt purchaser, 
or collection agent were not recognized by her. Applicant failed to submit any 
documentation to support her contentions that she had filed such disputes. Merely 
disputing certain accounts because they were not recognized, without substantially 
more, and without any substantiating documentation, is not sufficient to prove those

 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

disputes. In this instance, Applicant should have had greater familiarity with her various 
accounts, or an enhanced interest in following through on disputed issues. 
 
Trustworthiness adjudications are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The 
adjudicative guidelines do not require an applicant to establish resolution of each and 
every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve 
financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no 
requirement that an applicant immediately resolve or make payments on all delinquent 
debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in an SOR be 
paid first. Rather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the 
payment of such debts one at a time. In this instance, there is a verbal alleged plan to 
resolve financial problems, but there is little documentation to support the existence of 
such a plan.  
 
In this instance, there are purported actions taken, but there is no documentation 
to support the existence of any of Applicant’s claimed actions or payments. She failed to 
submit her proposed repayment plan related to her accounts with a repayment 
schedule, or repayment arrangements supposedly entered into with various creditors, or 
proof of past payments. Applicant has not acted responsibly by failing to timely address 
her delinquent accounts or the judgments filed against her.54 Applicant’s relative 
inaction under the circumstances confronting her cast substantial doubt on her current 
reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.55 
 
There is no evidence to indicate that Applicant ever received financial 
counseling. Based on the information furnished, it appears that Applicant has no funds 
remaining at the end of each month for discretionary use or savings. As reported by her, 
there is a deficit of $9 each month. There is no evidence to reflect that Applicant’s 
financial problems are under control. To the contrary, the overwhelming evidence leads 
to the conclusion that Applicant’s financial problems are not under control.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.56   
     
 There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. There is no 
evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling protected 
information, or substance abuse. Applicant has worked with the same employer since 
October 2012. She is a loving, caring mother and grandmother. Confronted with 
financial issues following her second divorce from her first husband, her periods of 
unemployment, his second husband’s period of unemployment, and her health issues, 
Applicant prioritized her accounts. With only a very modest annual income, she 
apparently made some efforts to resolve her delinquent accounts. Applicant did not 
conceal her financial difficulties when completing her e-QIP. Instead, she was honest 
and forthright, and she reported some of them.  
 
The disqualifying evidence is more substantial and compelling. Applicant 
contended she paid a number of her accounts, but she failed to submit any 
documentation such as receipts, cancelled checks, account records, etc., to support her 
contentions. Applicant has failed to take any positive action to resolve any of the 
accounts even after her 2012 OPM interview. Although she was urged to submit 
documentation to support her contentions that she had entered into a number of 
repayment agreements with her creditors and had made a number of payments to 
creditors and collection agencies, she failed to submit such materials. She has not 
received any financial counseling. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial 
problems are no closer to becoming under control. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
                                                          
56
 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 57 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a poor track record of debt reduction and elimination 
efforts. She discussed repayment arrangements and payments to creditors, but she 
again offered no documentation, even though she was exhorted to do so.  
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a position of public trust. For all of these reasons, 
I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from her 
financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.r.:  Against Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility to 
occupy a public trust position to support a contract with DOD.  Eligibility is denied.
