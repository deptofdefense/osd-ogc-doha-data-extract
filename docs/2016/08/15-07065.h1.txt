GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 26, 2015, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On March 19, 2016, 
the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel 
Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended and modified (Regulation); DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines 
for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the DOD 
on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under 
the Directive. The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to make

an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for occupying a public trust 
position to support a contract with the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 28, 2016. In a sworn 
statement, inadvertently dated April 13, 2015,2 Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On May 5, 2016, 
Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was 
assigned to me on June 6, 2016. A Notice of Hearing was issued on June 28, 2016. I 
convened the hearing, as scheduled, on July 13, 2016.  
 
 During the hearing, three Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 3) and one 
Applicant exhibit (AE A) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 22, 2016. I kept the record open to 
enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity. She 
timely submitted a number of additional documents, which were marked as AE B 
through AE F that were admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on 
August 10, 2016. 
  
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.i.) of the SOR. She did not 
agree with some of the amounts alleged, but failed to specify which ones she disputed. 
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I 
make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been a full-
time health care finder and provider relations representative for a defense contractor 
since March 2015.3 She had previously gone through several periods of unemployment: 
August 2014 until November 2014; April 2010 until February 2011; and December 2007 
until January 2009.4 She is seeking to retain her eligibility for occupying a public trust 
position to support a contract with the DOD. She is a 2003 high school graduate.5 She 
has never served in the U.S. military.6 Applicant was married in July 2014 and 
separated in April 2015.7

 It should be noted that the affidavit form upon which Applicant was to choose either a hearing or a decision 
based upon the administrative record, and list her contact information, and which the notary public was to sign, was a 
boilerplate preprinted form with “2015” furnished by the DOD CAF. The correct date should be “2016.”

Financial Considerations8 
 
In December 2007, Applicant was fired from her position as an online specialist 
with a bank for having inappropriate content on her office computer. Applicant 
unsuccessfully disputed the basis for her discharge, claiming she was wrongfully 
accused and wrongfully terminated.9 During her period of unemployment, Applicant was 
supported by unemployment compensation and spent her time attending her religious 
organization and doing housework.10 In order to qualify for unemployment 
compensation, Applicant had to submit two job applications per week. She contended 
she sought more than just two jobs each time.11  
 
In April 2010, Applicant was fired from her position as a sales representative for a 
communications company for attendance issues. Applicant disputed the basis for her 
discharge and went through the appeal process with the assistance of her union 
representative. Although the employer offered to reinstate her, it refused to pay her for 
time lost. Applicant declined the proposed reinstatement, ending the appeal process.12 
During her period of unemployment, Applicant was supported by unemployment 
compensation and spent her time attending her religious organization and doing 
housework.13  
 
Applicant acknowledged that in 2006 or 2007, due to her own immaturity, she 
had incurred more debt than she could afford. She failed to make monthly payments on 
her own accounts in order to financially assist her mother or siblings with their living 
expenses.14 Monthly car loan payments were missed, and two vehicles were eventually 
repossessed. In June 2015, three months after separating from her husband, Applicant 
misled an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) by saying 
that she had her spouse’s income and had enough money to pay off her accounts as 
well as living expenses.15

Applicant’s father owns a credit counseling company. She claimed that 
commencing in late 2014, her father has been giving her advice on how to pay off her 
delinquent debt. She also stated that she had been giving him between $20 and $100, 
without specifying the frequency of such payments, to contact her creditors and pay 
them unspecified amounts under “pre-negotiated payment plans” about which she had 
no specifics.16 She failed to submit copies or specifics of the repayment plans to confirm 
the existence of such plans. In April 2016, a representative of the credit counseling 
company indicated that Applicant came to it seeking advice on how to clear up some of 
her outstanding debt, and that Applicant has been adhering to the suggested budget 
she was given.17 She failed to submit a copy of the suggested budget to confirm the 
existence of one. An account statement, dated August 9, 2016, from the credit 
counseling company reflects activity on the account between August 1, 2011, and 
August 9, 2016. There are 18 accounts reflected with 15 payments made between 2011 
(3 payments), 2014 (3 payments), 2015 (5 payments), and 2016 (4 payments), some of 
which were made to accounts which are not listed in the SOR.18 
A debt assessment furnished by Applicant indicates 12 debts with a combined 
total of $42,035. It also indicates that combined payments of $1,121 are scheduled for 
each month.19 With the exception of documentation related to three payments made on 
July 25, 2016, nearly two weeks after the hearing was conducted, with a combined total 
of $45, Applicant failed to submit documentation to support monthly payments for the 
remaining $1,076.  
The SOR identified nine purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, totaling 
approximately $16,273, as reflected by her March 2015 credit report.20 All of the debts 
and their respective current status, according to the credit reports, other evidence 
submitted by the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding 
same, are described below:  
SOR ¶ 1.a.: This is an automobile loan with a high credit of $9,944 and past-due 
balance of $2,901 that was placed for collection and charged off in the amount of 
$5,625 in December 2014.21 Applicant contends that, through her father’s company, she 
made three $25 payments in February 2015.22 There is no evidence of any more recent 
payments being made during the ensuing 18 months. The account remains unresolved.

SOR ¶ 1.b.: This is a loan in the amount of $1,579 that Applicant obtained to pay 
other bills that was placed for collection, charged off in the amount of $1,050, and sold 
to another lender after Applicant ceased making her monthly payments of $110 in mid-
2014.23 Applicant contends that, through her father’s company, she made two 
payments, one for $25 in February 2015 and one for $19 in May 2015.24 There is no 
evidence of any more recent payments being made during the ensuing 15 months. The 
account remains unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.c.: This is an online household products ordering service account in the 
amount of $392 that was charged off in March 2015.25 Applicant acknowledged that she 
stopped making monthly payments to use the unspent funds for living expenses.26 
There is no evidence of any payments being made during the ensuing 17 months. The 
account remains unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.d.: This is an automobile loan with a high credit of $19,620 that was  
charged off and sold to another lender in August 2014 after Applicant ceased making 
her monthly payments of $390.27 The vehicle was repossessed and sold.28 Applicant 
estimated that she still owes $7,000 on the account.29 There is no evidence of any 
payments being made after the repossession. The account remains unresolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.e. through 1.i.: These are medical accounts with unpaid balances of 
$665, $475, $450, $310, and $306.30 Applicant contends that, through her father’s 
company, she made two $15 payments (one each for SOR ¶¶ 1.h.31 and 1.i.32) in July 
2016, nearly two weeks after the hearing.33 There is no evidence of any other  
payments ever being made. Three of the accounts remain unresolved, and two are in 
the process of being resolved. 
Applicant does not currently use the suggested budget to keep track of her 
income and expenses.34 She contends she receives a monthly net income of

approximately $1,800. Her normal monthly expenses include $200 for rent, $298 for 
insurance for two automobiles, $117 for her cell phone, $262 for two storage units, $415 
for one automobile loan, $538 for another automobile loan, and $75 for food expenses 
for a total of $1,905, leaving a monthly deficit, not a remainder.35 Applicant failed to 
include monthly expenses for medical expenses, health insurance, clothing, laundry, 
gasoline, miscellaneous expenses such as entertainment, or any debt repayments 
(which she claimed were $1,121). Furthermore, her estimate for monthly food expenses 
is unrealistically low. Applicant said she had no savings and “probably” $100 in her 
checking account. Her 401(k) retirement account has approximately $600.36  
 
Because Applicant claimed she has insufficient money to pay her debts, she was 
afforded the opportunity to supplement the record with a number of items to bring her 
finances into better focus. She failed to submit a personal financial statement, the 
specific financial guidance she received, proof of payments made on her SOR accounts 
(other than the two payments she eventually made after the hearing), or specific 
contacts with her medical creditors. It appears that Applicant's financial problems are 
not close to becoming under control.  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a [position of public trust].”37 As Commander in 
Chief, the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on 
national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to 
have access to such information. Positions designated as ADP-I and ADP-II are 
classified as “sensitive positions.”38 “The standard that must be met for . . . assignment 
to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s loyalty, 
reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties 
is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.”39 DOD contractor personnel 
are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final 
unfavorable access determination may be made.40

Appeals (DOHA) to continue to utilize the Directive in ADP contractor cases for trustworthiness determinations.

When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a public trust 
position. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”41 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.42  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  
Furthermore, security clearance determinations, and by inference, public trust 
determinations, should err, if they must, on the side of denials.43 In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations 
is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
       
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. 
Under AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially 
disqualifying. Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” 
may raise trustworthiness concerns. In 2006 or 2007, Applicant incurred more debt than 
she could afford. At some point, Applicant had insufficient money to maintain all of her 
monthly payments. Various accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection, 
and sometimes charged off. Two automobiles were repossessed. Some accounts were 
sold to debt purchasers. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) have been established.   
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate 
trustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the 
disqualifying condition may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, 
was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.” Also, under AG ¶ 20(b), financial trustworthiness concerns may be mitigated 
where “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the 
person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person has received or is receiving 
counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 
20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”44  
                                                          
44
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].  
 
9 
                                      
 
AG ¶¶ 20(b) and 20(c) minimally apply. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(d) do not apply. The 
nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties since at 
least 2006 or 2007 make it difficult to conclude that it “was so infrequent.” It is apparent 
that Applicant’s periods of unemployment created financial hardships that made it 
difficult to maintain her accounts in a current status. But the real culprit in her financial 
dilemma was her own immaturity, as well as her lack of financial responsibility. 
Applicant’s financial irresponsibility continues until the present day, for while she is 
burdened by substantial delinquent debts, she recently purchased a 2016 automobile 
with a monthly payment of $538, an amount she can ill-afford. Applicant has 
acknowledged debts totaling $42,035, including her SOR-related debts of $16,273. 
From 2011 until two weeks after the hearing, she made 15 rather insignificant 
payments. Although her purported repayment plan calls for monthly payments of 
$1,121, it is clear that her plan is unrealistic in light of her limited income and continuing 
unwise financial decisions. 
 
Applicant offered no realistic documentary evidence of a good-faith effort to 
resolve any of her accounts. Making two $15 payments in July 2016 (two weeks after 
the hearing) on SOR accounts that became delinquent in 2011 or 2012 is insufficient to 
constitute a “good-faith effort,” especially in light of her recent purchase of a new 2016 
automobile. 
 
Trustworthiness adjudications are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The 
adjudicative guidelines do not require an applicant to establish resolution of each and 
every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve 
financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no 
requirement that an applicant immediately resolve or make payments on all delinquent 
debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in an SOR be 
paid first. Rather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the 
payment of such debts one at a time. In this instance, while there is an alleged plan to 
resolve financial problems, there is little documentation to support evidence of positive 
action being taken under the plan. Instead, there is exacerbation of financial difficulties 
with the addition of the costly new car, especially after two vehicles were already 
repossessed, and the unpaid balances of those vehicles remain delinquent. 
 
In this instance, Applicant failed to submit her proposed repayment plan related 
to her accounts with realistic repayment schedules, or repayment arrangements 
supposedly entered into with various creditors, or proof of past payments. Applicant has 
not acted responsibly by failing to timely address her delinquent accounts.45 Applicant’s

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case

relative inaction under the circumstances confronting her cast substantial doubt on her 
current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.46 
 
There is superficial evidence to indicate that Applicant has received financial 
counseling. Based on the information furnished, it appears that Applicant has no funds 
remaining at the end of each month for discretionary use or savings. As reported by her, 
there is a deficit each month. There is no evidence to reflect that Applicant’s financial 
problems are under control. To the contrary, the overwhelming evidence leads to the 
conclusion that Applicant’s financial problems are not under control.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.47   
     
 There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. There is no 
evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling protected 
information, or substance abuse. Applicant has worked with the same employer since 
March 2015. She had periods of unemployment. She made some small efforts to 
resolve some of her delinquent accounts. Applicant did not conceal her financial 
difficulties when completing her e-QIP. Instead, she was honest and forthright, and she 
reported some of them.  
 
The disqualifying evidence is more substantial and compelling. Two of 
Applicant’s periods of unemployment resulted from being terminated by her employers

for unacceptable conduct. During her periods of unemployment, Applicant was 
supported by unemployment compensation and spent her time attending her religious 
organization and doing housework. Searching for a new job was apparently not as 
important, although she noted that she exceeded the requirement for two job 
applications per week to qualify for her unemployment compensation. She was 
immature and financially irresponsible, choosing to help others financially while 
seemingly ignoring her own debts. Two vehicles were repossessed. Accounts were 
charged off. Ignoring her delinquent debts, she purchased a new 2016 automobile. 
Applicant has failed to take significant positive action to resolve any of the accounts. 
She finally took insignificant steps to address two such accounts nearly two weeks after 
the hearing. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are not close 
to becoming under control. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 48 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a very poor track record of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. She discussed repayment arrangements and payments to creditors, 
but she offered no documentation of the types requested, even though she was 
exhorted to do so.  
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a position of public trust. For all of these reasons, 
I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from her 
financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i.:  Against Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility to 
occupy a public trust position to support a contract with DOD.  Eligibility is denied.
