HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 The statement of reasons (SOR) alleges nine delinquent debts totaling $25,801, 
including a $10,000 federal income tax debt. In 2009, Applicant failed to withhold  
sufficient funds for his federal income taxes, and he currently owes about $8,000 to the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS). He has made some progress paying his delinquent 
debts. However, his history of owing federal income taxes continues to raise unresolved 
financial considerations security concerns. Access to classified information is denied.  
 
History of the Case 
  
On September 2, 2014, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (e-QIP) (SF 86). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On December 
2, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) 
issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF could not make the affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative 
judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
 
2 
                                         
 
revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the 
financial considerations guideline. 
 
On December 21, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a 
hearing. On February 22, 2016, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On March 
21, 2016, the case was referred to me. On June 20, 2016, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for July 
13, 2016. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled.  
 
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 
16-17; Government Exhibit (GE) 1-5) Applicant objected to the accuracy and staleness 
of the credit reports. (Tr. 17-18) I overruled Applicant’s objection, but noted I will give 
less weight to information in credit reports that he disputes. (Tr. 17-18) Applicant offered 
11 exhibits, which were admitted without objection. (Tr. 19-24, 38-42; Applicant Exhibit 
(AE) A-K) The transcript was received on July 23, 2016.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.b through 
1.e and 1.g through 1.i. Applicant denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.f. He also 
provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted 
as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 67-year-old technician employed by a defense contractor, who is 
seeking to continue his security clearance, which he has held for more than 20 years 
without a security violation. (Tr. 6, 26, 33, 57) In 1967, he graduated from high school. 
(Tr. 6) In 1971, he received an associate’s degree. (Tr. 6-7) He served on active duty in 
the Army from 1972 to 1978. (Tr. 7) When he left the Army he was a sergeant (E-5). (Tr. 
7) He received an honorable discharge. (AE G; AE H; GE 1) In 1981, he married, and in 
1986, he divorced. (Tr. 8) In 1988, he married his spouse. (Tr. 8; GE 1) His child is 26 
years old, and his stepchild is 39 years old. (Tr. 8; GE 1)   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s employer moved operations to a different state. (Tr. 25) In 2007, 
Applicant was unemployed for one month. (Tr. 30) He moved to a different company, 
and his annual salary was reduced from $78,000 to $58,000. (Tr. 25, 31) In 2006 or 
2007, his spouse received knee surgery; she could not work; and his household income 
was further reduced by the loss of her $35,000 annual salary. (Tr. 30-32) He maintained 
his mortgage and most debts in current status; however, some debts became 
delinquent. (Tr. 25) His home decreased in market value. (Tr. 33)  
 
Applicant’s current annual salary is $68,000. (Tr. 31) Applicant began receiving 
$2,230 monthly Social Security retirement payments one month ago, and he began 
receiving $2,100 monthly retirement payments from a previous employer a year ago. 
(Tr. 29, 34-35) He received financial counseling in 2009 or 2010. (Tr. 35) He intends to 
resolve his remaining debts in the near future, and he wishes to continue his current 
 
3 
                                         
 
employment. (Tr. 26, 54) He intends to retire in two years, and he wants to have all 
accounts in current status. (Tr. 54) He has about $140,000 equity in his house and 
about $2,000 in the bank. (Tr. 55-56) 
 
Applicant’s history of financial problems is documented in his credit reports, 
September 2, 2014 SCA, October 2, 2014 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 
personal subject interview (PSI), SOR response, and hearing record. The SOR alleges 
nine delinquent debts totaling $25,801, and their current status is as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a is a bank debt placed for collection for $3,454.  Applicant said it was 
paid in 2011. (Tr. 27; SOR response) Applicant’s February 16, 2016 Equifax credit 
report shows: the account became delinquent in 2011; the balance is $3,454; the past-
due amount is $3,103; and it was charged off in February 2016. (GE 4 at 2) Applicant 
acknowledged that he had several accounts with this creditor, and he paid off one 
account. (Tr. 28) When he called the creditor in May 2016, the creditor said the account 
was charged off, and the creditor did not elaborate further about the debt. (Tr. 28-29)     
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c are two bank debts from the same creditor for the same 
amount, $1,547, that were placed for collection. Applicant said they were duplications of 
each other. (Tr. 36-37; SOR response) The balance owed is $2,915. Applicant made 
$200 monthly statements for seven months from January through July 2016. (Tr. 38-39; 
AE J)   
 
SOR ¶ 1.d is a bank debt placed for collection for $2,744. Applicant made three 
$120 payments in 2016 to the creditor. (Tr. 40-42; AE K) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e is a bank debt placed for collection for $2,040. Applicant planned to 
pay the creditor $1,200 on August 1, 2016, in full settlement of the debt. (Tr. 43) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f is a pest control company debt placed for collection for $1,547. 
Applicant believes the debt is actually about $354, and it is paid in full. (Tr. 44) He 
provided a January 2016 check for $155 and an April 2016 check for $112 made 
payable to the creditor. (AE E) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g is a bank debt placed for collection for $429. Applicant provided 
cancelled checks showing the account was paid and resolved in December 2015. (Tr. 
45-46; AE D) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h is a debt placed for collection for $2,493. In 2016, Applicant made 
about four $125 payments to the creditor. (Tr. 46-47; AE B)   
 
SOR ¶ 1.i is a federal tax lien filed in 2009 for $10,000. Applicant miscalculated 
his income resulting in a federal tax debt. (Tr. 47, 57) In his September 2, 2014 SCA, 
Applicant said he had a $175 monthly installment payment plan with the IRS. (GE 1)  At 
his hearing, he said he made payments for at least one year. (Tr. 48) Applicant withheld 
insufficient funds from his income for his federal income taxes for tax years 2011 and 
2013, and he owed about $1,500 for each year. (Tr. 48, 58-59) He also under withheld 
 
4 
                                         
 
for 2015, and he owes the federal government several hundred dollars in federal 
income taxes for 2015. (Tr. 59) On May 29, 2015, the IRS wrote Applicant that his taxes 
owed for tax years 2011 and 2013 were included in his $175 monthly installment plan. 
(SOR response) He provided checks showing from November 2015 through June 5, 
2016, he made seven $175 payments to the IRS under his payment plan. (AE C) His 
total current federal tax debt is about $8,000. (Tr. 48-49) He also owes a much lesser 
amount to the state for income taxes. (Tr. 58-59)1  
    
Character Evidence 
 
 Applicant provided a July 1987 letter from the White House thanking him for 
sending words of support and encouragement to President Reagan. (AE F) Applicant 
was designated a drill sergeant in July 1971. (AE I) 
      
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
                                            
1Applicant’s SOR does not allege that he failed to pay his federal income taxes as required for tax 
years 2011, 2013, and 2015, and his state income taxes in full as required for several years. In ISCR 
Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which 
conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 
14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). 
Consideration that Applicant failed to fully pay his federal income taxes for tax years 2011, 2013, and 
2015, and to fully pay his state income taxes for several years when due will not be considered except for 
the five purposes listed above. 
 
5 
                                         
 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this 
decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
 
6 
                                         
 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt 
is documented in his credit reports, SCA, SOR response, and hearing record. The SOR 
alleges nine delinquent debts totaling $25,801, including a $10,000 federal income tax 
debt. Around 2008, Applicant failed to withhold sufficient funds for his federal income 
taxes (which resulted in a $10,000 federal tax lien in 2009), and he currently owes about 
$8,000 to the IRS. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and  
 
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   
 
7 
                                         
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a) through 20(d) apply to the non-tax delinquent debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b 
through 1.d, and 1.f through 1.h. These debts are either paid or in a payment plan. He 
received financial counseling. He assured he intends to pay the unresolved debts. 
Applicant made good progress bringing his non-tax delinquent debts to current or paid 
status. 
 
Three circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his finances. 
Applicant’s employer moved operations to a different state. In 2007, Applicant was 
unemployed for one month. He moved to a different company, and his annual salary 
was reduced from $78,000 to $58,000. In 2006 or 2007, his spouse received knee 
surgery; she could not work; and his household income was further reduced by the loss 
of her $35,000 annual salary. His home decreased in market value.  
 
Applicant’s failure to timely pay his taxes in full raises the most significant 
security concern. Around 2008 and for tax years 2011, 2013, and 2015, he failed to pay 
his federal income taxes in full when due. He has had a tax debt ranging from $10,000 
to the current $8,000 from 2009 to the present. He also owes an unspecified amount of 
state income taxes. He has a payment plan to resolve his $8,000 federal tax debt. 
Applicant is receiving two pensions in addition to his salary. He did not explain why he 
did not make more progress resolving his tax debts. Financial considerations security 
concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
 
8 
                                         
 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a 67-year-old technician employed by a defense contractor, who is 
seeking a security clearance. In 1971, he received an associate’s degree. He served on 
active duty in the Army from 1972 to 1978. Applicant was designated a drill sergeant.  
When he left the Army he was a sergeant, and he received an honorable discharge. A 
July 1987 letter from the White House thanked Applicant for sending words of support 
and encouragement to President Reagan.  
 
Reduction in Applicant’s income through changes in employment, loss of his 
spouse’s employment because of knee surgery, and decrease in his home value were 
all circumstances beyond his control that adversely affected his finances.  
 
In 2009, Applicant failed to withhold sufficient funds for his federal income taxes, 
and he currently owes about $8,000 to the IRS. He either paid or is making payments to 
address six of the nine SOR debts. Three debts remain unresolved totaling about 
$12,000 including an $8,000 IRS debt.   
 
Applicant failed to fully pay his federal income taxes around 2008 and for tax 
years 2011, 2013, and 2015 when due. He owes an unspecified amount of state income 
taxes. He has been making payments on his delinquent taxes since at least September 
2014. However, his history of failing to fully pay his federal and state income taxes when 
due raises unresolved financial considerations security concerns. He owes about 
$8,000 to the IRS.3 When an issue of delinquent taxes is involved, an administrative 
judge is required to consider how long an applicant waits to file their tax returns, 
                                            
3See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security 
clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A security clearance represents 
an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor 
other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and 
ability to protect classified information.”). 
 
 
9 
                                         
 
whether the IRS generates the tax returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax 
debt arises to begin and complete making payments.4 There is no evidence Applicant 
failed to timely file his tax returns; however, the primary problem here is that Applicant 
has owed about $8,000 to $10,000 to the IRS since 2009. He did not prove his inability 
to make greater progress resolving his tax debts.  
 
 I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated.

not all tax returns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More 
recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a 
security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 
2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his 
tax returns and paid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The 
Appeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, 
contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized the “the 
allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure to 
file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established government 
rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
