NOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Department of Defense’s (DOD) intent to deny his 
eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant incurred delinquent debt under 
circumstances that do not reflect negatively on his security worthiness. Clearance is 
granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 16, 2014, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing 
security concerns under the financial considerations guideline.1 DOD adjudicators were 
unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s 
security clearance and recommended her case be submitted to an administrative judge 
for consideration.
