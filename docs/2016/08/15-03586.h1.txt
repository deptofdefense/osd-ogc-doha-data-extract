GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 9, 2013, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On December 6, 2015, 
the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel 
Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended and modified (Regulation); DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines 
for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the DOD 
on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under 
the Directive. The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to make

an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for occupying a public trust 
position to support a contract with the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 21, 2015. In a sworn 
statement, dated January 4, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On March 16, 2016, Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to 
me on March 23, 2016. A Notice of Hearing was issued on April 29, 2016. I convened 
the hearing, as scheduled, on May 18, 2016.  
 
 During the hearing, four Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4), four 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE D), and two administrative exhibits were admitted 
into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on 
June 1, 2016. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant 
took advantage of that opportunity. He timely submitted a number of additional 
documents, which were marked as AE E through AE P, and admitted into evidence 
without objection. The record closed on June 22, 2016. 
  
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.f.) of the SOR. Applicant’s 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a full-
time client advocate for a defense contractor since March 2016.2 He had previously 
spent a number of years (1993 until 2016) in various positions (associate – analyst, vice 
president – productivity analyst, and vice president consultant – business technology 
analyst) with two major international banks.3 He is seeking to retain his eligibility for 
occupying a public trust position to support a contract with the DOD. He has never 
served in the U.S. military.4 He is a 1984 high school graduate and the recipient of a 
2000 bachelor’s degree.5 Applicant was married to his first wife in August 1988 and 
divorced in March 1994. He married his second wife in August 2003.6 He has two sons,

Financial Considerations8 
 
Applicant and his wife purchased their first home in 2004 with a high credit of 
$286,150. While contemplating real estate investment, he received information on 
buying, renting, and selling properties, and he obtained realtor’s licenses in two states. 
The national housing market was flying high. Housing prices peaked in early 2006, but 
started to decline later that year. After checking out several property portfolios, 
Applicant subsequently invested in other real estate and successfully rented his 
properties without any trouble. There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances 
until sometime in mid-2008 when the housing “bubble” burst and the national economy 
and the real estate market started to implode. The financial community was surprised, 
and no one knew the length and depth of the implosion. Individuals lost their jobs or 
were otherwise unable to maintain their normal monthly rent payments. Bankruptcies 
and foreclosures soared. Some renters simply departed in the middle of the night 
without informing the landlords. Although the renters of Applicant’s first property came 
upon hard times and could not continue their lease payments, Applicant managed to 
keep up with his mortgage payments and finally sold that property in April 2016. He was 
not as successful with his other properties. 
The SOR identified six purportedly continuing delinquent accounts referring to 
three rental properties that went into foreclosure, as reflected by the July 2013 credit 
report,9 the August 2014 credit report,10 and the March 2015 credit report.11 Those 
debts and their respective current status, according to the credit reports, other evidence 
submitted by the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding 
same, are described below:  
In December 2006, Applicant purchased his second investment property for 
approximately $132,500 split 80% between a bank first mortgage in an unspecified 
amount (SOR ¶ 1.c.), and 20% for a second mortgage in the amount of $33,125 (SOR ¶ 
1.d.).12 Applicant had a reliable tenant. However, in mid-2009, at the end of her lease,

his tenant relocated to another property in the same area for one-half the rent. Applicant 
unsuccessfully tried to rent his property, and then put it up for sale. He paid the 
mortgage on the vacant property until he exhausted his savings, and then he 
approached the mortgage lender to offer a deed in lieu of foreclosure. His offer was 
rejected.13 The property was foreclosed in early 2010, and a notice of foreclosure sale 
was issued in February 2010.14 The property was sold in April 2010 for $105,090.15 In 
September 2014, the successor in interest to the second mortgage lender issued 
Applicant a Form 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt, indicating that $49,867.98 of the second 
mortgage debt had been discharged.16 The accounts have been resolved. 
 
In August 2007, Applicant purchased his third investment property for 
approximately $235,500 split 80% between a bank first mortgage in the amount of 
$188,400 (SOR ¶ 1.a.),17 and 20% for a second mortgage in the amount of $47,100 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.).18 Applicant’s tenant lost his job and was unable to continue making rent 
payments. Applicant unsuccessfully tried to rent his property, and then put it up for sale, 
hoping for a short or routine sale.19 His efforts were unsuccessful. As with his other 
rental properties, he paid the mortgage on the vacant property until he exhausted his 
savings, and then he approached the mortgage lender to renegotiate or refinance his 
mortgage or offer a deed in lieu of foreclosure.20 The property was foreclosed in mid-
2010, and a notice of foreclosure sale was issued in May 2010.21 The property was sold 
in July 2010 for $219,946.22  
 
Applicant was of the belief that he was informed that there was a deficiency of 
approximately $30,000 after the sale, but he is uncertain if he ever received a Form 
1099-C, and appears confused.23 Moreover, according to Applicant’s July 2013 credit 
report, the loan “grantor reclaimed collateral to settle defaulted mortgage,” leaving a

conform to the evidence that reflects that there was a past-due amount of $23,759, and deleting references to a 
second mortgage and a deficiency balance. There being no objection, and considering the fact that the figure 
proposed already appeared in GE 3 (at 1) and GE 4 (at 1), the motion was granted. The amendment was entered into 
the record as Administrative Exhibit II. See Tr. at 80-86.

zero balance.24 The subsequent credit reports for August 2014 and March 2015 reflect 
the erroneously merged first and second mortgages as a second mortgage, and report 
the high credit as $188,400, with a past-due amount of $23,759 and remaining balance 
of $46,786.25 Based upon my rough calculations, if there is a deficiency, it is not from 
the first mortgage because the actual sale price exceeded the remaining loan balance. 
There might be one of approximately $15,500 from the second mortgage. The first 
mortgage account (SOR ¶ 1.a.) has been resolved, but the second mortgage account 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.) has not been resolved. 
 
In October 2007, Applicant purchased his next investment property, a boarding 
house, with a mortgage for approximately $355,500 (SOR ¶ 1.f.).26 Applicant’s tenants 
were inconsistent with their monthly rent payments and eventually were unable to 
continue making them. Applicant unsuccessfully tried to rent his property, and then put it 
up for sale, hoping for a short or routine sale.27 His efforts were unsuccessful. As with 
his other rental properties, he paid the mortgage on the vacant property until he 
exhausted his savings, and then he approached the mortgage lender to renegotiate or 
refinance his mortgage or offer a deed in lieu of foreclosure.28 The property was 
foreclosed in the fall of 2008, and a notice of foreclosure sale was issued in October 
2008.29 The property was sold in February 2009 for $369,942. According to Applicant’s 
July 2013 credit report, the loan “grantor reclaimed collateral to settle defaulted 
mortgage,” leaving a zero balance.30 The account has been resolved.  
 
In January 2008, Applicant purchased his next investment property with a 
mortgage for approximately $349,200 (SOR ¶ 1.e.).31 Applicant’s tenants were 
inconsistent with their monthly rent payments and eventually were unable to continue 
making them. Applicant unsuccessfully tried to rent his property, and then put it up for 
sale, hoping for a short or routine sale.32 His efforts were unsuccessful. As with his other 
rental properties, he paid the mortgage on the vacant property until he exhausted his 
savings, and then he approached the mortgage lender to renegotiate or refinance his 
mortgage or offer a deed in lieu of foreclosure.33 The property was foreclosed, and in

mid-2009, it was sold for $68,000.34 According to Applicant’s July 2013 credit report, the 
account was transferred to another lender, leaving a zero balance.35 Applicant’s May 
2016 credit report also reflects a zero balance.36 In the absence of any current negative 
information pertaining to the account, I conclude that the account has been resolved.  
In October 2009, during the period when Applicant’s finances were under siege 
and his rental properties were draining him of his savings, Applicant engaged the 
professional services of a credit repair law firm to contact his creditors to resolve his 
accounts. He continued using their services for a couple of years, starting out with 
monthly payments of $60. Eventually, the monthly fee increased to a point when 
Applicant chose to terminate the relationship as being too costly.37 That professional 
relationship was followed by another one with an organization that not only represented 
him, but also furnished financial guidance on credit repair. This relationship lasted 
approximately one year.38 While the two organizations furnished some guidance and 
some success with minor financial issues, they were ineffective with respect to 
Applicant’s mortgages.39 
Applicant’s Personal Financial Statement indicates a monthly net income of 
$4,542, and normal monthly expenses of $3,181, leaving a monthly remainder of $1,361 
available for saving or spending.40 He has approximately $400 in his checking account, 
$4,000 in his savings account, and approximately $50,000 in his 401(k) retirement 
account.41 Applicant has no other outstanding debts.42 His credit score, as of May 16, 
2016, was 756, or excellent.43 In the absence of any additional unidentified 
delinquencies, it appears that Applicant's financial problems are under control.

The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a [position of public trust].”44 As Commander in

Chief, the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on 
national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to 
have access to such information. Positions designated as ADP-I and ADP-II are 
classified as “sensitive positions.”45 “The standard that must be met for . . . assignment 
to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s loyalty, 
reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties 
is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.”46 DOD contractor personnel 
are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final 
unfavorable access determination may be made.47  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a public trust 
position. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”48 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.49

for Counterintelligence and Security, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases, dated November 19, 2004, covers the 
handling of trustworthiness cases under the Directive. The memorandum directed the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) to continue to utilize the Directive in ADP contractor cases for trustworthiness determinations.

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  
Furthermore, security clearance determinations, and by inference, public trust 
determinations, should err, if they must, on the side of denials.50 In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations 
is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
       
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. 
Under AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially 
disqualifying. Also, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” 
may raise trustworthiness concerns. Applicant’s initial financial problems arose in mid-
2008 when his real estate investment activities turned sour and his rental properties 
started going into foreclosure. Because he was unable to continue making his monthly 
mortgage payments, four rental properties were foreclosed and sold. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c) have been established.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate 
trustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the 
disqualifying condition may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, 
was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.” Also, under AG ¶ 20(b), financial trustworthiness concerns may be mitigated

where “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the 
person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person has received or is receiving 
counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 
20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”51 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. The nature of Applicant’s multi-year 
period of financial difficulties, commencing in 2008 and extending to 2010, was 
occasioned by a largely unexpected world-wide financial cataclysmic event. The 
housing “bubble” burst and the national economy and the real estate market imploded. 
Individuals lost their jobs or were otherwise unable to maintain their normal monthly rent 
payments. Bankruptcies and foreclosures soared. Applicant’s financial problems were a 
direct result of those unusual events that were largely beyond his control. His tenants 
bailed out and it was nearly impossible to replace them. He was burdened by zero 
rental income. Nevertheless, Applicant continued making his monthly mortgage 
payments until he exhausted his savings. His good-faith efforts were overcome by the 
reality of insufficient funds to continue doing so. He contacted his mortgage lenders in 
an effort to renegotiate or refinance his mortgages. He tried selling his properties. He 
was not successful. The properties were foreclosed and sold, in most instances for 
amounts that settled the defaulted mortgages.  
 
Several years before the SOR was issued, Applicant utilized the professional 
services of two different credit repair organizations in an effort to resolve his mortgage 
issues and other debts. He paid for their services, and while they provided some 
positive financial guidance and success with minor financial issues, they were 
ineffective with respect to his mortgages. Applicant has no other delinquent accounts. 
He has savings, a good monthly remainder available for saving or spending, and an 
excellent credit score. Applicant's financial problems are under control. Applicant’s 
actions no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.52

 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.53   
     
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He became a 
real estate investor and, when he was unable to continue making his monthly mortgage 
payments, saw his investments sour and fall into foreclosure. Four properties were 
foreclosed and sold. 
 
 The mitigating evidence is more substantial and compelling. There is no 
evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling protected 
information, or substance abuse. After a lengthy career in international banking, 
Applicant received information on buying, renting, and selling properties, and he 
obtained realtor’s licenses in two states. Over the course of three years he invested in 
four rental-producing properties. Unexpected circumstances disrupted his investment 
plans when the housing “bubble” burst and the national economy and the real estate 
market imploded. Applicant’s tenants lost their jobs or were otherwise unable to 
maintain their normal monthly rent payments. Nationwide, bankruptcies and 
foreclosures soared, and Applicant was drawn into the downward spiral of real estate 
prices followed by foreclosures and further declines of real estate prices. Applicant did 
not conceal his financial difficulties when completing his e-QIP. Instead, he was honest 
and forthright, and he reported them. The undisputed developed evidence enables me 
to conclude that there are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are now 
under control.

Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a position of public trust. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f.:  For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility to 
occupy a public trust position to support a contract with DOD.  Eligibility is granted.
