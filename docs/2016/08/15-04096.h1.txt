HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s federal tax returns were not timely filed for several years, and he has 
owed federal tax authorities thousands of dollars since the late 1990s. In the last four 
years, he has made progress; and his current federal tax debt is about $38,000. He 
resolved the other debts alleged in his statement of reasons (SOR). Financial 
considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Access to classified information is 
denied.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On September 15, 2014, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On December 22, 2015, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant 
to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
 
2 
                                         
 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the 
SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. 
 
On January 12, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he requested a 
hearing. On March 16, 2016, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On April 20, 
2016, the case was assigned to me. On May 16, 2016, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for June 7, 2016. 
(HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled.  
  
Department Counsel offered 4 exhibits, and Applicant offered 12 exhibits. (Tr. 15-
16, 19-23; Government Exhibit (GE) 1-4; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-L) Applicant objected 
to GE 3 and 4, which are credit reports, because they do not reflect the current state of 
his finances and debts. (Tr. 16-17) Applicant was advised that it was his burden to 
present evidence at the hearing to rebut or clarify the content of the credit reports, and 
his objection was overruled. (Tr. 16-18) There were no objections to Applicant’s 
proffered exhibits. (Tr. 23-24) On June 14, 2016, DOHA received a copy of the 
transcript of the hearing. On July 15, 2016, Applicant provided 16 post-hearing exhibits, 
which were admitted without objection. (AE M-BB) The record closed on July 15, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted being responsible for all of the 
accounts alleged in the SOR except for the account in SOR ¶ 1.m. He also provided 
extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings 
of fact.  
 
Applicant is 50 years old, and he has been employed by a defense contractor as 
a senior security engineer since September 2014. (Tr. 6, 8; GE 1) In 1984, he 
graduated from high school. (Tr. 6) From 1984 to 1987, he attended college, where he 
majored in business management. (Tr. 6) In 2015, he received a bachelor’s degree in 
information technology. (Tr. 6) He never served in the military. (Tr. 6-7) From 2001 to 
2008, he was a network engineer team lead for a cable television company. (Tr. 8) 
From 2008 to 2014, he was employed as a service and delivery manager for a different 
cable television company. (Tr. 8) He had periods of unemployment in 2008 and 2014. 
(Tr. 8) He received severance pay in 2008. (Tr. 30-31) When he left his employment in 
2014, he received a $25,000 severance; and he applied $7,214 to pay his child support 
obligation. (Tr. 32)   
 
In 1998, he married, and in 2000, he divorced. (Tr. 7; GE 1) In 2005, he married, 
and he has five children; however, none of them live in his household. (Tr. 7) He does 
not have any child support obligations. (Tr. 7) There is no evidence of alcohol, drug 
abuse, or felony-level criminal convictions. (Tr. 29-30; GE 1)

Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant’s SOR alleges that he owes 14 creditors $90,892, and this total 
includes about $82,000 in delinquent taxes and $5,316 in child support. (Tr. 14) He 
provided summaries of his efforts to resolve each SOR debt. (SOR response; AE A; AE 
M) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a federal tax lien filed in 2005 for $1,838. Applicant’s 2005 
federal tax lien was for taxes owed for three years in the late 1990s. (Tr. 33) He paid 
this federal tax debt in 2008. (Tr. 26, 41) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a federal tax lien filed in May 2011, for $62,272. This tax lien 
was for tax years 2001 through 2006 as follows: 
 
Tax Year Date of 
Assessment

Assessment 
2001 Dec. 12, 2005 $3,199 
2002 Oct. 3, 2005 $12,922 
2003 Oct. 17, 2005  $4,524 
2004 Aug. 3, 2009 $15,471 
2005 Aug. 3, 2009 $8,463 
2006 Aug. 3, 2009 $17,423 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a federal tax lien filed in October 2011, for $18,735. This tax 
lien was for tax years 2008 through 2010 as follows: 
 
Tax Year Date of 
Assessment 
Unpaid Balance or 
Assessment 
2008 Sep. 12, 2011 $4,214 
2009 Sep. 12, 2011 $4,281 
2010 Sep. 12, 2011 $10,239 
 
Applicant provided financial support, including multiple loans, to family members 
and a girlfriend in lieu of fully paying his federal income taxes when due. (Tr. 34-35) The 
IRS withdrew the tax liens. (Tr. 32; SOR response) Applicant provided proof that he has 
paid $200 monthly to the IRS for 16 months; he timely paid his 2015 federal income 
taxes; and he has forfeited any federal income tax refund he has been scheduled to 
receive. (Tr. 24-25, 39-40) Actually, he has been making payments to the IRS since 
2011. (Tr. 39) The current amount of his total IRS federal income tax debt is $38,000. 
(Tr. 25) He has submitted two offers in compromise of his IRS debt; however, he has 
not learned the IRS’ response. (Tr. 25) He believes he can pay off the IRS debt in 12 to 
14 months if the IRS accepts his offer. (Tr. 26) He said he has timely filed his federal 
income tax returns since tax year 2010. (Tr. 35) The IRS initially assessed his tax debt 
to be more than $100,000, and he filed his taxes for tax years 2003 to 2009 in 2010, 
which significantly reduced his tax debt to about $80,000. (Tr. 37, 47)

In May 2016, the IRS wrote Applicant and said he owed $38,087 for tax years 
2004, 2005, 2008, 2009, and 2010. (Tr. 42-43) The tax year 2006 debt, which was 
previously estimated at $17,423 in the IRS lien, was not included in the IRS summary of 
his debt because after he filed his return, the balance owed was zero. (Tr. 48) In July 
2016, Applicant offered to settle his federal income tax debt of $38,087 for $9,500. (AE 
N-AE P)   
 
Applicant paid the four medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d for $150, 1.e. for $91, 1.g for 
$145, and 1.j for $150. (Tr. 26-28, 43-44; AE D; GE 4 at 2; GE 3 at 13) In 2013, he paid 
his child-support debt in SOR ¶ 1.i for $117. (Tr. 27, 44-45; AE H; GE 3 at 14) In 
February 2016, he paid his child support arrearage in SOR ¶ 1.f for $5,316, and he also 
provided financial support to his daughter, who was attending college. (Tr. 26-27, 46)  
 
Applicant disputed the telecommunications debt in SOR ¶ 1.h for $1,302 as 
fraudulent; he sent documentation to the three credit reporting companies; and the 
negative entry was removed from his credit report. (Tr. 27) He paid the parking tickets in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.k for $55 and 1.l for $55. (Tr. 28) He disputed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.m for $240 
as erroneous; he sent correspondence to the creditor; and the negative entry was 
removed from his credit report. (Tr. 28, 45-46; GE 3 at 16; AE BB) In 2013, Applicant 
paid his cell phone bill for $427 in SOR ¶ 1.n. (Tr. 28-29) He has not received financial 
counseling. 
 
In sum, Applicant resolved the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.n. (Tr. 51) He is 
making progress resolving the tax debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b.       
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
 
5 
                                         
 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;” and “(g) failure to file annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required . . . .” Applicant’s SOR alleges 
that he owes 14 creditors $90,892, and this total includes about $82,000 in delinquent 
taxes and $5,316 in child support. He admitted that he failed to timely file his federal tax 
returns, and he currently owes about $38,000 in federal income taxes.  
 
  In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board 
explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). The Government established the disqualifying conditions in 
AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability 
of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
  
 
7 
                                         
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;1 and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
No mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant presented some 
mitigating information. He had variations in his income, and he was unemployed in 2008 
and 2014. Family and friends had financial problems, and he provided financial 
assistance to them. These unusual circumstances were beyond Applicant’s control and 
caused or contributed to Applicant’s financial problems. Applicant disputed the debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.m, and those debts were removed from his credit report. He has not 
                                            
1The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

received financial counseling. Applicant is credited with mitigating the financial 
allegation in SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.n.      
 
Applicant failed to withhold sufficient funds from his salary to pay his share of his 
federal income taxes. He failed to timely file his federal tax returns. The DOHA Appeal 
Board has commented: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. 
Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for 
protecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is 
not directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 
(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward 
inducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at 
evaluating an applicant’s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails 
repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the 
high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted 
access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 
(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union 
Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 
886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 
2002)). ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board 
clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the 
applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent 
such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant’s 
security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing 
irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR 
Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, 
no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employed an “all’s well that 
ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified 
information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
Applicant consistently paid $200 monthly since 2011 to address his delinquent 
federal income tax debt. His federal income tax refunds were intercepted and applied to 
his delinquent tax debt. He made an offer to settle his $38,000 IRS tax debt for $9,500. 
Notwithstanding these positive developments, he has owed taxes to the federal 
government since the late 1990s. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
 
9 
                                         
 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is 50 years old, and he has been employed by a defense contractor as 
a senior security engineer since September 2014. From 1984 to 1987, he attended 
college, where he majored in business management. In 2015, he received a bachelor’s 
degree in information technology. From 2001 to 2008, he was a network engineer team 
lead for a cable television company. From 2008 to 2014, he was employed as a service 
and delivery manager for a different cable television company. He has periods of 
unemployment in 2008 and 2014. He does not have any child support obligations.  
There is no evidence of alcohol, drug abuse, or felony-level criminal convictions.    
 
The SOR alleges three federal tax liens totaling more than $80,000 and those 
liens resulted from multiple tax years going back to the late 1990s. His current federal 
tax debt is about $38,000. He failed to timely file his federal tax returns for multiple tax 
years. His history of failing to fully pay his federal income taxes when due raises 
unresolved financial considerations security concerns.2 When an issue of delinquent 
taxes is involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how long an applicant 
waits to file their tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax returns, and how long 
the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete making payments.3

clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A security clearance represents 
an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor 
other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and 
ability to protect classified information.”).

and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only 
after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated 
himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone 
entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015)

beyond applicant’s control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and

The primary problem here is that Applicant has owed thousands of dollars to the IRS 
since the late 1990s. His financial support for family and friends is a positive character 
trait; however, it does not fully mitigate his failure to pay his federal income taxes when 
due. He did not prove his inability to make greater progress resolving his tax debts.  
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to 
Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a 
determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for 
award of a security clearance in the future. With more effort towards documented 
resolution of his past-due debt, and a track record of behavior consistent with his 
obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security 
clearance worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.c through 1.n:  For Applicant 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                                                                                            
garnishment of Applicant’s wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); 
ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting 
not all tax returns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More 
recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a 
security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 
2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his 
tax returns and paid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The 
Appeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, 
contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations 
regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax 
returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established government rules 
and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted).

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
