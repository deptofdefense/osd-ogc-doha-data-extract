CERVI, Gregg A., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86)1 on 
October 17, 2012. On August 20, 2015, the Department of Defense Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant 
detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations.2 
                                                     
1 Also known as a Security Clearance Application (SCA). 
 
2 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended; and the Adjudicative Guidelines 
for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), implemented by the DOD on 
September 1, 2006. 
 
2 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on November 18, 2015, and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 7, 2016. 
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on 
April 25, 2016, scheduling the hearing for May 26, 2016. The hearing was convened as 
scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without 
objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were 
admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 6, 2016. 
The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional information. He submitted 
AE E through N, which were admitted without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 The SOR alleges Applicant is indebted on 11 delinquent debts, and that he failed 
to file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2007 through 2011. Applicant 
admitted the SOR allegations with some explanations. 
 
 Applicant is 52 years old and employed as a field service engineer for a defense 
contractor since 2012. Applicant has been married since 1987 and has two children, 
one with special needs. In approximately 2014, his spouse filed for divorce, but the 
action has been stagnant and the family is still together. Applicant lives and works in 
state A, while his spouse and children live in state B. Applicant travels extensively for 
his work and returns home every three to six months. He holds a bachelor’s degree and 
a master’s degree in business administration. This is his first application for a security 
clearance. 
 
The SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts and failure to file state and federal income 
tax returns when due. Applicant’s actions to resolve the SOR allegations are noted

 In the past, Applicant’s spouse typically handled household finances. In 2007, 
she was in an auto accident and suffered fractured bones and a head injury which may 
have affected her ability to handle household finances at times.3 Applicant has a current 
gross income of approximately $160,000. From 2003 to 2010, Applicant worked as an 
independent contractor in a subchapter “S” corporation with his spouse, providing

problems resulting from the accident.

technical expertise to corporate clients. He earned about $65,000 per year during this 
period.4 They used an accountant to handle tax filings.5 
 
 Applicant claimed he first became aware of mismanagement of his finances 
when he pulled his credit bureau report (CBR) to complete his SF 86 for his current 
employer. He reported extensive debts, including federal and state tax delinquencies in 
his SF 86, completed in 2012. He estimated tax delinquencies dating back to 2007, and 
other debts dating back to 2008. He attributed his financial delinquencies to his 
spouse’s accident6 and slow recovery, a poor business environment, and latent or 
irregular accounts receivable.7 He noted that the circumstances created by his personal 
issues, his extensive travel away from home, and business issues resulted in the 
delinquencies, but that he was working with an accountant to resolve them. 
 
 At the time of his Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview in November 
2012, Applicant was unable to pay several of his delinquent debts.8 He noted that his 
spouse’s medical bills, slow-paying clients and an economic downturn contributed to his 
financial problems. He was unable to stay current on his taxes because of his spouse’s 
inability to attend to them. He has not sought financial counseling or debt consolidation, 
but was working with an accountant to resolve his federal and state tax issues.9 
 
 In testimony, Applicant said his financial situation deteriorated between 2009 and 
2014. He believes his spouse intentionally failed to pay medical bills so that she can file 
“medical” bankruptcy, and mismanaged other debts.10 With respect to his 2007 to 2009 
tax returns, he was having difficulty recreating or locating business records. By July 
2015, Applicant became more vigilant of his debts and payments, and no longer relies 
on his spouse.11 He has now changed his address and contact information with 
creditors so that he is notified of bills when they occur.12 His current CBR shows no new 
delinquencies.13

 Applicant provided excellent performance appraisals, student evaluations, 
awards, and a letter of appreciation. He also provided 11 character reference letters that 
generally attest to his professionalism, integrity, character, work ethic, reliability and 
trustworthiness, despite knowing of the matters listed in the SOR. 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security clearance 
decision.14 The Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of the evidence.15 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  It is well-established 
law that no one has a right to a security clearance. As noted by the Supreme Court in 
Egan, “the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations 
should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, 
and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.16

to a security clearance”); Duane v. DOD, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no right to a security 
clearance).

The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to 
whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, 
consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
      
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19.  The following are potentially applicable in this case: 
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 
(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required or the fraudulent filing of the same. 
 Applicant incurred several delinquent debts and failed to file federal and state tax 
returns when due for tax years 2007 to 2011. The evidence is sufficient to raise the 
above disqualifying conditions. 
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
 
7 
 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Security requirements include consideration of a person’s judgment, reliability, 
and a sense of his legal obligations.17 Although Applicant has now resolved all of the 
SOR debts, they were largely paid in May 2016, one week before his security clearance 
hearing, despite knowledge of the debts since at least 2012.18 The delinquent 2010-
2014 tax returns were filed in April 2015, one month before his hearing.19 His 2007-
2009 tax returns were not filed until after his hearing. Failure to comply with federal and 
state tax laws suggests Applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established 
government rules and regulations.20 
 
 Timing of resolution of financial problems is relevant in determining the extent to 
which an applicant has demonstrated mitigation. Although I accept Applicant’s 
explanation for not knowing about delinquent household debts due to his wife’s alleged 
mismanagement of finances and his extended absence from the home, he was put on 
notice in 2012 of the delinquent debts yet failed to address the majority of them until 
2015 and 2016, just before his security clearance hearing. Taxes are another matter. 
He was operating a business from 2003 to 2010 and testified that he used an 
accountant for tax matters. Although his spouse’s condition may have led to additional 
medical debts and quirky behavior with regard to paying bills, there is no credible 
evidence to suggest this behavior prevented Applicant from taking responsibility for the 
family finances earlier, filing taxes on time, and paying debts once her condition became 
apparent or when he became aware of financial anomalies. 
                                                     
17 ISCR Case No. 14-00221 at 3 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016); Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union, Local 
473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
18 The mortgage was resolved well before the hearing, and two debts were paid in the fall of 2015. 
 
19 Applicant voluntarily submitted evidence of late-filed tax returns for 2012-2014. These tax returns were 
not alleged in the SOR and therefore not considered under the Guideline F analysis. The 2015 tax returns 
were filed on-time. 
 
20 ISCR Case No. 14-00221 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016).

 Applicant showed a laissez faire attitude toward his financial responsibilities and 
exhibited little effort to resolve the debts and tax issues once it clearly became a 
security clearance issue in 2012. Since that time, Applicant’s efforts to resolve these 
matters have been unreasonably delayed, and the evidence suggests he has exercised 
inadequate control over his finances. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations, such as filing and paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the 
high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to 
classified information.21 Applicant’s lack of financial responsibility toward his 
government tax obligations demonstrates the absence of that judgment. 
 
  Although the evidence shows that Applicant eventually filed his tax returns and 
paid the delinquent debts, I find that he failed to act reasonably under the circumstances 
or in good faith, and has not established a financial track record to show similar issues 
are unlikely to recur. His financial issues have been recent and ongoing, and he has not 
sought financial counseling or assistance in meeting his financial obligations outside of 
the use of accountants for his taxes. Mitigating conditions ¶¶ 20(b) and (c) partially 
apply because his spouse’s accident and the economic downturn affecting his business 
were conditions outside of his control, and he eventually resolved the debts and tax 
delinquencies. However, Applicant clearly did not act responsibly or make a good-faith 
effort to stay aware of his finances, take charge when necessary, and resolve the debts 
and tax issues until his security clearance hearing was imminent. His overall financial 
responsibility and willingness to comply with rules and regulations remain a concern, 
and his actions cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. 
No mitigating condition is fully applicable. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered all of the 
                                                     
21 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).

potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the evidence in favor of 
and against Applicant, and the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have 
incorporated my findings of fact and comments under Guideline F in this whole-person 
analysis.  
 
 Applicant’s extreme delay in filing eight years of tax returns, and resolution of the 
majority of his debts coincident with his security clearance hearing despite receiving 
notice of these issues in 2012, does little to show a good-faith effort to resolve his 
financial problems once they became apparent. Overall, the record leaves me with 
questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I 
conclude Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a, 1.g and 1.j:   For Applicant  
 
  Subparagraph 1.b - 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.k - 1.m. Against Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
