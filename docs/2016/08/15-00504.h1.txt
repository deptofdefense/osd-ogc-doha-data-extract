GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 10, 2012, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On August 1, 2015, 
the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel 
Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended and modified (Regulation); DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines 
for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the DOD 
on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under 
the Directive. The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to make

an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for occupying a public trust 
position to support a contract with the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 15, 2015. In a sworn 
statement, dated September 1, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On December 10, 2015, 
Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was 
assigned to me on January 7, 2016. A Notice of Hearing was issued on January 20, 
2016. I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on February 4, 2016. At the 
commencement of the hearing, Applicant submitted an Amended Answer to the SOR.2 
 
 During the hearing, five Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 5), eight 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE H), and one administrative exhibit were admitted 
into evidence without objection. Applicant and one witness testified. The transcript (Tr.) 
was received on February 16, 2016. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to 
supplement it. Applicant failed to take advantage of that opportunity. The record closed 
on February 22, 2016. 
  
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.d. through 1.y.) of the SOR. She 
supplemented that Answer with an Amended Answer to the SOR and altered some of 
her positions. She changed her responses from “admit” to “deny” for the following 
allegations: ¶¶ 1.d., 1.r., 1.s., 1.t., 1.v., and 1.x., and she changed her response from 
“admit” to “unknown” for ¶ 1.o. Upon the motion by Department Counsel that the SOR 
be amended by withdrawing the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.w., and there being no objection, 
the motion was granted and the SOR was amended.3 Applicant’s admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been a full-
time claims processor for a defense contractor since August 1996. She is seeking to 
retain her eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract with the 
DOD, which was initially granted to her in 2002.4 She served honorably on active duty 
with the U.S. Air Force from April 1988 until May 1990.5 During that period, Applicant

received no awards and decorations. She is a 1986 high school graduate with about 
one year of college credits.6 Applicant was married in February 1996 and widowed in 
June 2014.7 She has a daughter, born in 2001.8 
 
Financial Considerations9 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until April 2010. She and 
her husband were both employed, and they generally maintained all their accounts in a 
current status. Things changed in April 2010 when her husband lost his job due to 
illness. It was six to eight months before he could start drawing unemployment 
compensation. The unemployment compensation eventually ceased. Her husband was 
able to obtain new employment in February 2011, but the salary was about 50 percent 
less than before. He maintained that position for two years, but because of a continuing 
illness, he lost that job in February 2013. This time there was no unemployment 
compensation. In November 2013, Applicant’s husband entered the hospital, and he 
never left: he died in June 2014. During that entire period, Applicant took a combined 
two months of leave without pay. Fortunately, all of Applicant’s husband’s medical bills 
were paid by an unidentified benefactor at the hospital because Applicant’s husband did 
not have health insurance. As a result of his condition, the reduction in family income, 
the emotional stress, and the eventual loss of his income, Applicant’s ability to maintain 
her accounts was strained to the maximum. She was forced to prioritize her accounts, 
and she chose to address necessities and living expenses first, with other accounts 
next. Accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection, charged off, or went 
to judgment. Many were sold to debt purchasers.10 
The SOR originally identified 25 purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, 
totaling approximately $50,391,11 as reflected by the August 2012 credit report,12 the 
December 2014 credit report,13 and the September 2015 credit report.14 Those debts 
and their respective current status, according to the credit reports, other evidence

submitted by the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding 
same, are described below:  
SOR ¶ 1.a.: This is a bank credit card with a credit limit of $13,500 and a past-
due and unpaid balance of $15,493 that was placed for collection and charged off. 
Applicant claimed that in February 2016 the creditor advised her that a Form 1099-C 
(Cancellation of Debt) would be furnished to her.15 As of the closing of the record, no 
such document had been submitted to me by Applicant. The account remains 
unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.b.: This is a bank credit card with a credit limit of $6,000 and an unpaid 
balance of $7,610 that was placed for collection and charged off. Applicant claimed that 
in February 2016 the creditor advised her that a Form 1099-C would be furnished to 
her.16 As of the closing of the record, no such document had been submitted to me by 
Applicant. The account remains unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.c.: This is a credit card with a credit limit of $5,000 and an unpaid 
balance of $5,875 that was placed for collection and charged off. A Form 1099-C was 
issued to her in January 2016.17 The account has been resolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d. and 1.q.: This is a department store charge account with a credit 
limit of $1,700, initial high credit of $2,253 and past-due balance of $699 that was 
placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser. That debt purchaser increased the 
high credit to $2,254 and the past-due amount initially to $2,197, then to $2,661, and 
eventually to $2,778.18 Applicant acknowledged responsibility for the named account, 
but not the debt purchaser’s listing, and indicated that she was unable to commence 
payments until other accounts on her priority list were satisfied.19 The account remains 
unresolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.e. and 1.p.: This is a department store charge account with a credit 
limit of $2,418, initial high credit of $2,163 and past-due balance of $860 that was 
placed for collection. The balance of $2,651 was charged off, and the account was sold 
to a debt purchaser.20 Applicant contacted the credit purchaser to set up a repayment

intends to continue making monthly payments until the account is resolved.21 The 
account is in the process of being resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.f.: This is a bank charge account for a warehouse store with a balance 
of $1,697 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser.22 It was 
apparently transferred to a law firm. Applicant contacted both the debt purchaser as well 
as the law firm in an effort to set up a repayment plan, but, to date, her efforts have 
been unsuccessful.23 The account remains unresolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.g. and 1.s.: This is an unspecified type of bank charge account with a 
credit limit of $5,000, high credit of $1,031, and past-due balance of $658 that was 
placed for collection.24  Applicant contacted the credit purchaser to set up a repayment 
plan. She made her initial $11 payment under that plan on February 3, 2016, and she 
intends to continue making monthly payments until the account is resolved.25 The 
account is in the process of being resolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.h. and 1.n.: These are two hospital accounts with unpaid balances of 
$810 and $220 that were placed for collection with the same collection agency.26 
Applicant contacted the collection agency to set up a repayment plan. The accounts 
were combined, and Applicant made her initial $25 payment under that plan on 
February 3, 2016. She intends to continue making monthly payments until the accounts 
are resolved.27 The accounts are in the process of being resolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.i.: This is a clothing store charge account with a credit limit of $530 and 
unpaid balance of $617 that was placed for collection and charged off in December 
2011. The account was either sold or otherwise assigned to another collection agent.28 
Applicant acknowledged responsibility for the named account and indicated that she

SOR ¶ 1.j.: This is a department store charge account with a credit limit of $500 
and unpaid balance of $464 that was placed for collection and charged off in November 
2011. The account was either sold or otherwise assigned to an unidentified collection 
agent.30 Applicant acknowledged responsibility for the named account and indicated 
that she was unable to commence payments until other accounts on her priority list

SOR ¶ 1.k.: This is a credit card account with a credit limit of $300 and unpaid 
balance of $403 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser.32 Applicant 
contacted the credit purchaser to set up a repayment plan. She made her initial $134.46 
payment under that plan on February 3, 2016, and she intends to continue making 
monthly payments until the account is resolved.33 The account is in the process of being 
resolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.l. and 1.u.: This is a home improvement store credit card account with 
a credit limit of $500 and unpaid balance of $322 that was placed for collection and 
charged off in October 2011. The account was subsequently sold to a debt purchaser 
who now reports the unpaid balance as $323.34 Applicant contacted the credit 
purchaser to set up a repayment plan. She made her initial $12.53 payment under that 
plan on February 3, 2016, and she intends to continue making monthly payments until 
the account is resolved.35 The account is in the process of being resolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.m. and 1.x.: These are two medical accounts (one is for an 
anesthesiologist and the other is unspecified) with unpaid balances of $244 and $110 
that were placed for collection. The collection agency for only one of the accounts has 
been identified.36 Applicant contended that she contacted the collection agency to set 
up a repayment plan for all of her medical accounts, and that the accounts were 
combined, and she made made her initial $25 payment under that plan on February 3, 
2016.37 There is no documentation to support her contention that all of the medical

accounts were combined. Under the circumstances, it is impossible to conclude that 
these two accounts were included in her repayment plan. The resolution status of these 
two accounts is unclear. 
SOR ¶ 1.o.: This is a judgment in the amount of $1,387 obtained by a debt 
purchaser in March 2013 for an unspecified type of account.38 The plaintiff who obtained 
the judgment is the same debt purchaser revealed in SOR ¶¶ 1.d. and 1.q. above, and 
its name does not appear in any of the credit reports discussed above with the 
exception of these entries.  Applicant claimed to have no knowledge of the judgment, 
and she has not contacted the listed plaintiff to learn more about the judgment or the 
identity of the original creditor.39 There is no evidence that she ever attempted to 
contest the matter with the court in which the judgment was obtained. The account 
remains unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.r.: This is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid and past-due 
balance of $1,747 that was placed for collection and sold to the listed debt purchaser.40 
The account does not appear in Applicant’s 2014, 2015, or 2016 credit reports. 
Applicant claims she disputed the account, but acknowledged that she had not yet 
attempted to contact the listed collection agent/debt purchaser.41 She failed to submit 
any documentation to support the existence of a dispute. The account remains 
unresolved. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.t. and 1.v.: This is a department store charge account with a credit limit 
of $250 and unpaid balance of $468 that was placed for collection and charged off. The 
account was sold to a debt purchaser.42 Applicant initially acknowledged responsibility 
for the named account, but subsequently denied such responsibility because the 
account was no longer in her most recent credit report.43 The account remains 
unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 1.y.: This is a medical account with unpaid balance of $84 that was 
placed for collection.44 Applicant indicated that the entire balance would be paid the day 
after the hearing which was also her pay day.45 Although she was offered the

opportunity to do so, she failed to submit any documentation to support the existence of 
any such payment. The account remains unresolved. 
Applicant’s take-home pay per month is $840. In addition, she and her daughter 
apparently also receive benefits from Applicant’s late husband’s social security. Her 
parents periodically supply some financial aid to her when they can. Shortly after her 
husband’s death, she received a $10,000 payment from his life insurance.46 Applicant 
does not maintain a budget. She has never met with a financial counselor.47 As of 
February 3, 2016 – two days before her pay day – she had $31.46 in her checking 
account.48 Applicant purportedly realized the severity of her financial mess nearly 30 
months after she was interviewed by an investigator of the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) and 5 months after the SOR was issued because she feared losing 
her job.49 However, when afforded the opportunity to supplement the record with 
documentation supporting her contentions that repayment plans had been established; 
that Forms 1099-C had been furnished; that payments, other than those minimum ones 
made on February 3, 2016, were made to creditors both listed in the SOR as well as 
other unlisted creditors; that disputes had been filed; that additional contacts with 
creditors had been made; that a budget and personal financial statement had been 
created; or that financial counseling had been received, she failed to follow up on that 
opportunity. In addition, she failed to submit her DD Form 214. It appears that 
Applicant's financial problems are not any closer to becoming under control.  
 
Work Performance and Character References 
Over the years, Applicant was awarded several certificates in recognition of her 
work performance and superior achievements.50 Her actual work performance ratings 
were not submitted for consideration. Applicant’s mother characterized Applicant as a 
hard worker with a good reputation for honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness. Applicant 
was also described as a good daughter (because she does unspecified things for her 
mother) and a good mother (because she takes her daughter to sports activities).51  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”52 As Commander in Chief,

the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. Positions designated as ADP-I and ADP-II are classified as 
“sensitive positions.”53 “The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive 
duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s loyalty, reliability, and 
trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security.”54 Department of Defense contractor 
personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any 
final unfavorable access determination may be made.55  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a public trust 
position. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”56 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.57  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This

relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  
Furthermore, security clearance determinations, and by inference, public trust 
determinations, should err, if they must, on the side of denials.58 In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations 
is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
       
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. 
Under AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially 
disqualifying. Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” 
may raise trustworthiness concerns. Applicant’s initial financial problems arose in 2010 
and deteriorated, with some periods of stability, over the next few years. She had 
insufficient money to maintain all of her monthly payments. Various accounts, both SOR 
and non-SOR, became delinquent and were placed for collection, charged off, or sent to 
judgment. Some accounts were sold to debt purchasers. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) have 
been established.   
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate 
trustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the 
disqualifying condition may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, 
was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.” Also, under AG ¶ 20(b), financial trustworthiness concerns may be mitigated 
where “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the

person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person has received or is receiving 
counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 
20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”59 In addition, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply 
if “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt 
which is the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) partially apply. AG ¶ 20(d) minimally applies.  AG ¶¶ 20(c) 
and 20 (e) do not apply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing 
financial difficulties since 2010 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” 
or “was so infrequent.” It is clear that Applicant’s husband’s illness and associated 
employment problems, along with his eventual demise, created a financial situation from 
which Applicant failed to recover. Because of the loss of her husband’s income, 
Applicant was unable to maintain her accounts in a current status. She was forced to 
prioritize her accounts, and she chose to address necessities and living expenses first, 
with other accounts next. She received $10,000 from his life insurance policy. 
Nevertheless, accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection, charged off, 
or went to judgment. Many were sold to debt purchasers.  
 
For the vast majority of her delinquent accounts, both SOR and non-SOR, 
Applicant offered no documentary evidence of a good-faith effort to resolve them. She 
contended she paid a number of non-SOR accounts, but failed to submit any 
documentation such as receipts, cancelled checks, account records, etc., to support her 
contentions. As far as the SOR accounts, Applicant failed to take any positive action to 
resolve the vast majority of such accounts until February 1, 2016, nearly 30 months 
after she was interviewed by an OPM investigator and 5 months after the SOR was 
issued. She was finally motivated to take some action because she feared losing her 
job. On February 3, 2016, she paid various collection agents a total of $192.99. She 
offered no documentation to support the existence of subsequent payments to any 
creditors, debt purchasers, or collection agents. Over the years, at least until February 
                                                          
59
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

2016, she failed to pay or resolve accounts with balances as low as $84, $110, $220, 
and $244.  
 
It is apparent that several of the SOR accounts are duplicates. But, because of 
her inattention to her accounts, with few exceptions, Applicant was unaware of most of 
the duplications. Without even superficial examination of the accounts, Applicant merely 
disputed them because accounts with a particular identified creditor, debt purchaser, or 
collection agent were not recognized by her or were no longer listed in her most recent 
credit report. Merely disputing certain accounts, or claiming that they are duplicates, 
without substantially more, and without any substantiating documentation, is not 
sufficient to prove those disputes.  
 
This is not a particularly difficult endeavor. There is a substantial risk when one 
accepts, at face value, the contents of a credit report without obtaining original source 
documentation to verify entries. Credit bureaus collect information from a variety of 
sources, including public records and “other sources,” and it is these other unidentified 
sources that are the cause for concern. Likewise, when accounts are transferred, 
reassigned, sold, or merely churned, an individual’s credit history can look worse than it 
really is. In this particular instance, the credit reports referred to numerous creditors for 
far fewer delinquent accounts. Because of abbreviated names and acronyms, as well as 
incomplete account numbers, many of those entries are garbled and redundant, and 
have inflated the financial concerns. Furthermore, the absence of account numbers or 
the identity of original creditors or subsequent debt purchasers in the SOR and only 
partial accounts numbers in the credit reports, and no apparent effort to analyze the 
potential duplications, makes my analysis that much more difficult. Applicant should 
have had greater familiarity with her various accounts, or an enhanced interest in 
following through on disputed issues. 
 
Trustworthiness adjudications are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The 
adjudicative guidelines do not require an applicant to establish resolution of each and 
every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve 
financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no 
requirement that an applicant immediately resolve or make payments on all delinquent 
debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in an SOR be 
paid first. Rather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the 
payment of such debts one at a time. In this instance, there is a verbal alleged plan to 
resolve financial problems, but there is little documentation to support the existence of 
such a plan.  
 
In this instance, there are purported actions taken and some recent insignificant 
payments made to some creditors, but, with the exception of those insignificant 
payments, there is little documentation to support the existence of most of Applicant’s 
claimed actions or payments. She failed to submit a personal financial statement, her 
proposed repayment plan related to her accounts with a repayment schedule, 
repayment arrangements supposedly entered into with various creditors, where the 
$10,000 life insurance went, or proof of past payments. Applicant has not acted 
 
13 
                                      
 
responsibly by failing to timely address her delinquent accounts or the judgment filed 
against her.60 Applicant’s relative inaction under the circumstances confronting her cast 
substantial doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.61 
 
There is no evidence to indicate that Applicant ever received financial 
counseling. It is not known what Applicant’s financial resources may be, or if she has 
any funds remaining at the end of each month for discretionary use or savings. There is 
no evidence to reflect that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. To the 
contrary, the overwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that Applicant’s financial 
problems are not under control.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.62   
     
 There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. She is a 
veteran. There is no evidence of misuse of information technology systems, 
mishandling protected information, or substance abuse. Applicant has worked with the 
same employer since August 1996. She is a loving, caring mother and daughter.

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

Confronted with financial issues following her husband’s health issues, his 
unemployment and his under-employment issues, and his eventual death, Applicant 
prioritized her accounts. With only a very modest annual income, she apparently made 
some efforts to resolve her delinquent accounts. Applicant did not conceal her financial 
difficulties when completing her e-QIP. Instead, she was honest and forthright, and she 
reported them. A number of the SOR accounts are duplicates, and some of the 
allegations are merely “snapshots” along the timeline of the same account. 
 
The disqualifying evidence is more substantial and compelling. Applicant 
contended she paid a number of non-SOR accounts, but she failed to submit any 
documentation such as receipts, cancelled checks, account records, etc., to support her 
contentions. Applicant failed to take any positive action to resolve the vast majority of 
the SOR accounts until February 1, 2016, nearly 30 months after she was interviewed 
by an OPM investigator and 5 months after the SOR was issued. Because she feared 
the loss of her job, she finally took some positive action. On February 3, 2016, she paid 
various collection agents a total of $192.99. She offered no documentation to support 
the existence of subsequent payments to any creditors, debt purchasers, or collection 
agents. Although she was urged to submit documentation to support her contentions 
that she had entered into a number of repayment agreements with her creditors and 
had made a number of payments to creditors and collection agencies, she failed to 
submit such materials for a majority of her accounts. She failed to specify how and to 
whom the $10,000 life insurance policy proceeds were distributed. She failed to submit 
a personal financial statement to enable me to review her current financial status. She 
has not received any financial counseling. There are clear indications that Applicant’s 
financial problems are no closer to becoming under control. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
 
15 
                                      
 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 63 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a poor track record of debt reduction and elimination 
efforts during and after the illness and death of her husband. While she has spoken 
about having resolved non-SOR debts, she failed to submit documentation to support 
any such actions.  She discussed repayment arrangements and payments to SOR-
related creditors, but with the exception of payments totaling $192.99 to various 
collection agents in February 2016, she again offered no documentation, even though 
she was exhorted to do so.  
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a position of public trust. For all of these reasons, 
I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from her 
financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly not consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility to 
occupy a public trust position to support a contract with DOD.  Eligibility is denied.
