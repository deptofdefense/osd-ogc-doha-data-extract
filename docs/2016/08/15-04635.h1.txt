Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his eligibility for
access to classified information. The evidence is sufficient to explain and mitigate
Applicant’s financial problems or difficulties. Accordingly, this case is decided for
Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on December 12, 2014, for a periodic reinvestigation.1
Thereafter, on February 4, 2016, after reviewing the application and information
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).

gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD)  sent2
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified
information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the3
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. He
answered the SOR on March 7 and 28, 2016, and requested a hearing.          
The case was assigned to me on April 21, 2016. The hearing was held as
scheduled on May 26, 2016. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1–6, and they were
admitted. Applicant presented one witness (his spouse), testified on his own behalf, and
offered Exhibits A–B, and they were admitted. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was
received on June 6, 2016.  
Procedural Matters
Department Counsel withdrew the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b, based on duplication

Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 48-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance
that he has held while working for the same company since 1995.  His security5
clearance was last favorably adjudicated by the DOD in 2005.  His background includes6
honorable service in the U.S. Army (both active and reserve).  He is employed as an7
explosives specialist technician supervisor by a company that does research and
development for a DOD agency.  His first marriage ended in divorce in 1997. He8

married his current spouse in 1999. He has an adult child from his first marriage and
two minor children from his second marriage.  9
Applicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties related primarily to
foreclosure of a home in 2014. Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges the first and second
mortgage loans for the home as well as three collection accounts, which total about
$1,330. He disclosed the foreclosure and a paid state tax lien in his 2014 security
clearance application.  He provided additional details about his financial record during10
his 2015 background investigation.  The SOR allegations are established by11
Department Counsel’s documentary evidence as well as Applicant’s admissions in his
answer to the SOR and his hearing testimony. 
Concerning the three collection accounts, Applicant explained the basis for those
accounts and provided documentation showing that each is now paid.  The $8712
medical collection account went unpaid due to oversight.  It was paid in February13
2016.  The $263 collection account is for a telecommunications account. He denies14
having an account with the telecommunications company, but decided to pay it now and
dispute it later. It was paid in February 2016.  The $980 collection account stems from15
a joint checking account with a credit union. The account was closed, but subsequent
transactions resulted in overdraft fees. The account was referred for collection, and he
resolved it with a payment of $1,000.44 in May 2016.  In addition, he paid a $7516
medical collection account in May 2016, which was not alleged in the SOR.  17
Concerning the paid state tax lien, it stems from income earned by a daycare
business operated by Applicant’s wife during 2008–2012 from their home. She made
quarterly estimated tax payments, but believes some of the payments were not
received. A lien for $3,315 was filed in January 2013, and it was paid by withholding
from Applicant’s pay in April 2014.18

The foreclosure is related to a home Applicant and his spouse purchased for
about $115,000 in 2001; the loan was refinanced in 2004 for about $117,662; and the
loan was refinanced again in 2010 for about $109,466 at a lower interest rate. They
obtained a second mortgage loan for $20,365 in 2006 for upgrades and improvements.
The home was located in a relatively new subdivision, and the developer sold to another
developer who converted many homes to Section 8 housing, which is designed to
provide affordable housing for people who struggle to pay rent. Home values declined
as did the quality of the neighborhood due to an increase in crime.  The criminal activity19
included break-ins into their home and theft of property as well as illegal drug activity
and drive-by shootings in the neighborhood. He described one incident when his wife
and sons had returned home and caught  people in the home.20
Applicant and his wife decided their family’s safety was more important than
staying in the home. They attempted to sell in 2012 without a real estate agent.  They21
also worked with a real estate agent in 2013. A short sale fell through, and they were
behind on the loans because they were saving money for rent for their next (and
current) residence. They remained in the home before, during, and after the foreclosure
(described below) in an effort to cure the foreclosure but were unsuccessful. They
moved into their current rental property in August 2014.  
The first mortgage lender sued for foreclosure and obtained a stipulated and
default judgment in early 2014.  In May 2014, the state court awarded the first22
mortgage lender a judgment for $139,151, which included the principal balance of
$107,711. Per court order, the house was sold later that year with the first mortgage
lender buying it for $105,410.  The court prohibited the first mortgage lender from23
obtaining a deficiency judgment unless and until it files a motion for deficiency
judgment. Credit reports from 2015 and 2016 show a $0 balance for this account.  24
The second mortgage loan is more than 180 days past due with a past-due
balance of about $13,368.  Applicant has been in telephonic contact with the lender,25
and they proposed a one-time lump-sum payment of about $6,090. He currently lacks
the financial means to make the lump-sum payment, and so his plan is to apply for a

Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As27
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt28
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An29
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  30
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting31
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An32
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate33
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  34
In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a
preponderance of the evidence.  The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s35

reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence
standard.36
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it37
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant38
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 39
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  40
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
 AG ¶¶ 19(a) and (c).41
 AG ¶ 20(a)–(f).42

The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties as well as inability to satisfy debts.  With that said, I am41
primarily concerned about the foreclosure and the first and second mortgage loans. The
relatively small collection accounts as well as the paid state tax lien, which was not
alleged in the SOR, are not of great concern. The facts and circumstances show that
indebtedness was not incurred by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and there is no
evidence of an unwillingness to pay. 
I considered the six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and the following42
are most pertinent:
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
AG ¶ 20(c) [t]here are clear indications that the problem is being resolved
or is under control; and 
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
Applicant did not present a perfect case, but the evidence is sufficient to explain
and mitigate the concern stemming from his financial problems or difficulties. First, AG ¶
20(b), applies in Applicant’s favor because the foreclosure was greatly influenced by
circumstances largely beyond his control. Neither Applicant nor his spouse could have
anticipated when they bought the house in 2001 the change of circumstances they
experienced years later. The market value of the home declined due to the Section 8
housing and an increase in criminal activity. He made a reasonable and responsible
decision to put his family’s safety and security ahead of home ownership. Moreover, he
simply did not walk away from the home and mail the keys to the mortgage lender, but
tried without success to sell the home before foreclosure. Those are not the actions of
an irresponsible person. 
Second, AG ¶ 20(c) applies in Applicant’s favor because there are clear
indications that the worst of this situation is over and safely in the past. The six-figure
judgment in foreclosure was resolved by the sale of the home to the first mortgage
lender and the lack of a deficiency balance. The remainder, the second mortgage loan,
is in the process of being resolved by a proposed settlement for a lesser amount. He
has a realistic plan to make the lump-sum payment by obtaining a personal loan. 
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).43
8
Third, AG ¶ 20(d) applies in Applicant’s favor based on paying the collection
accounts and the state tax lien discussed above. 
In addition to the formal mitigating circumstances, I gave favorable consideration
to Applicant’s honorable military service; his long record of holding a security clearance
without a security infraction or violation; his long record of employment with the same
company; his voluntarily reporting of adverse financial information in his security
clearance application; and the fact that he was truthful and complete in responding to
questions during the security-clearance process. Those circumstances are good
indicators of stability, reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I also took into
account that the foreclosure occurred under an unusual set of circumstances, and it is
unlikely that Applicant will be faced with similar circumstances in the future.  
Applicant’s history of financial problems or difficulties does not create doubt
about his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect
classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice
versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I43
conclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified
information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.a: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.b: Withdrawn
Subparagraphs 1.c–1.f: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
