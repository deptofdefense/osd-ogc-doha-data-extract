GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations and 
personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information 
is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 31, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On August 18, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective

September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial 
Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF 
was unable to make an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The 
SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on November 9, 2015. On November 18, 2015, 
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have his case decided on 
the written record in lieu of a hearing.2 A complete copy of the Government’s file of 
relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant on January 6, 2016, and he was 
afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the 
FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Guidelines 
applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on January 27, 2016. A response 
was due by February 26, 2016. Applicant submitted documentation from the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) in response to the FORM on March 9, 2016. Department 
Counsel did not object to the documents. The case was assigned to me on May 25, 
2016.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied with brief comments the three factual 
allegations pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c.), and failed to 
address the allegation pertaining to personal conduct. Applicant’s brief comments are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a field 
service technician with his current employer since March 2012. He was previously a 
technician with another employer from July 1996 until March 2012.3 He is a 1982 high 
school graduate with a 1995 associate’s degree in an unspecified discipline.4 He has 
never served with the U.S. military.5 In fact, he never registered with the Selective 
Service System (SSS) as he had never heard of it or of the requirement to register with 
it.6 He has never held a security clearance.7 Applicant has an unusual marital history. 
He married his wife in December 1984. In February 1989, because she had applied for

employment where Applicant’s mother was employed, and the company had a policy 
prohibiting the hiring of relatives of employees, they were divorced. In May 1989, after 
she had been hired, Applicant and his ex-wife were remarried.8 At some point after 
January 1995, having grown apart, they again divorced.9 They have two sons born in 
1985 and 1989, respectively.10 
 
Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct11 
 
 It is unclear when Applicant first experienced financial difficulties, but in reviewing 
his comments to an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), 
it appears that while Applicant was able to generally maintain his financial obligations in 
the mid-1990’s, he was having difficulties with balancing the family finances, in part 
because his wife enjoyed shopping and spending money beyond their means. He was 
unable to save any funds.12 In more recent times, Applicant has struggled with 
maintaining a budget, and he has been forgetful and has procrastinated with the filing of 
his federal income tax returns.13 Furthermore, with respect to his federal income tax 
filings, he had not given the issue any priority and has been lazy in resolving it.14 As a 
result of a combination of those factors, Applicant failed to timely file his federal income 
tax returns for the tax years 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012.15 A federal income tax lien in 
the amount of $245 was filed in April 2009.16 In July 2013, Applicant indicated he 
intended to file the tardy income tax returns in August 2013.17  
 
The SOR identified two purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, totaling 
approximately $2,971. It also alleged that Applicant had failed to “submit” federal 
income tax returns for the tax years 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. The tax lien was not 
alleged. Those two debts and the income tax allegations, and their respective current 
status, according to the above-cited credit reports, Applicant’s comments to the OPM 
investigator, in the e-QIP, in his Answer to the SOR, and in Response to the FORM, are 
described as follows:

SOR ¶ 1.a. – This is a bank credit card account with an unpaid balance of 
$2,712.99 that was transferred or sold to a collection entity which filed a lawsuit against 
Applicant in April 2013. Applicant paid the entire balance in June 2013, over two years 
before the SOR was issued, and the available Government evidence clearly reflects that 
the account was resolved at that time.18 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b. – This is a medical account from an unidentified medical provider with 
a remaining balance of $223 about which Applicant was initially unaware, apparently 
because the creditor had the wrong mailing address for Applicant. He was able to 
contact the collection agent to validate the account. He contends he has paid the 
balance, but the documentation he submitted is merely an extract of a credit report with 
some notes written upon it,19 and there is no indication (by receipt or cancelled check) 
that the balance has, in fact, been paid. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c. – This refers to the failure to “submit” the federal income tax “filings” 
for the tax years 2009 through 2012. In his e-QIP, Applicant denied filing his federal 
income tax returns for the tax years 2010 and 2011.20 He explained that the IRS usually 
just sends him a letter if he owes additional taxes.21 During his OPM interview, he 
admitted he had not filed his federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2012 as well.22 In 
September 2015, the IRS issued three notices of intent to seize Applicant’s state tax 
refunds or other property to be applied to his unpaid income taxes, penalty, and interest 
for the tax years 2010 ($669.42), 2011 ($765.04), and 2012 ($1,342.55).23 In October 
2015, his anticipated refund for the tax year 2014 was applied to his remaining 2010 
and 2011 balances.24 Applicant finally filed his federal income tax returns for the tax 
years in issue: a Form 1040EZ for 2009 was filed on or before February 21, 2014;25 a 
Form 1040EZ for 2010 was filed on or before February 24, 2014;26 a Form 1040EZ for 
2011 was filed on or before February 20, 2014;27 and a Form 1040 for 2012 was filed on 
or before August 16, 2015.28 Because of a combination of diverted refunds by the IRS 
and actual payments by Applicant, the estimated remaining tax balances for the tax 
years were as follows: 2009 (zero); 2010 ($338.80); 2011 (zero); and 2012 ($1,406.04).

Applicant failed to furnish a personal financial statement setting forth his net 
monthly income; his monthly household expenses; and his monthly debt payments. In 
the absence of such information, it is impossible to determine if he has any monthly 
remainder available for savings or spending. Also, it is difficult to determine if 
Applicant’s finances are under control or if he is still experiencing financial difficulties. 
Nevertheless, a review of the two credit reports in evidence does not reveal any other 
delinquent debts. It is unclear if he still has a relatively small remaining income tax 
balance for the tax years 2010 and 2012. Nevertheless, with the 2014 filing of the tardy 
federal income tax returns, Applicant’s positive resolution of one or both of the other two 
debts, as well as his relatively recent embrace of the responsibility of timely filing his 
annual federal income tax returns, it appears that Applicant’s financial problems are 
now under control. There is no evidence that Applicant ever sought the services of a 
financial advisor, or that Applicant ever received financial counseling.29 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”30 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”31   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.

In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”32 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.33  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”34 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”35 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

 Cir. 1994).

Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. In addition, “failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax 
returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same” is potentially disqualifying under 
AG ¶ 19(g). Applicant has had a long-standing problem with his finances which started 
as early as 2009, when he stopped the timely filing of his federal income tax returns 
over a multiple-year period. His procrastination, laziness, forgetfulness, and a difficulty 
in maintaining a budget resulted in both the late income tax return filings and his failure 
to timely pay two bills that became delinquent. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) apply. 
    
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”36  
 
                                                          
36
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
 
8 
                                      
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) do not apply.  AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply. The nature, 
frequency, and recency of Applicant’s multi-year period of income tax difficulties since 
the tax year 2009 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so 
infrequent.” Nevertheless, Applicant finally severed his psychological restraints 
(procrastination, laziness, forgetfulness, and a difficulty in maintaining a budget), and 
addressed one of his delinquent debts in 2013, and his tax issues in 2014, both well 
before the SOR was issued. Applicant attributed those psychological issues to his 
failure to timely file his income tax returns, but those restraints were not beyond his 
control. However, the blemishes in Applicant’s credit reports have been addressed by 
Applicant when he belatedly initiated good-faith efforts to resolve his delinquent 
accounts and his unfiled federal income tax returns. While Applicant may not have 
received financial counseling, there are substantial indications that Applicant’s financial 
problems have been resolved and are under control. Applicant finally acted responsibly 
by addressing his delinquent accounts and unfiled federal income tax returns.37 
Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting him no longer cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.38 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG & 15:       
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
 The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 16(c), it is potentially disqualifying if there is 
 
credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not 
sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, 
but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person 
assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, 
lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other 
characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard 
protected information. 
                                                          
37
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

9 
                                      
 
Under AG ¶ 16(d), it is potentially disqualifying if there is 
 
credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other 
guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, 
but which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-
person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not 
properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited 
to consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. . . .  
 
Under AG ¶ 16(e), it is also potentially disqualifying if there is 
personal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, that 
creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . . 
engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person’s personal, 
professional, or community standing. . . . 
 Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for 2009, 2010, 2011, 
and 2012. Department Counsel has argued the applicability of all three of the above 
conditions without specifying those factors that support the conditions. The failure to file 
income tax returns is a recognized potentially disqualifying condition explicitly covered 
under Guideline F. Applicant’s federal income tax return issues involve questionable 
judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or even a pattern 
of rule violations. However, there is no evidence of a lack of candor or a pattern of 
dishonesty. Applicant made no effort to conceal his income tax return issues. AG ¶¶  
16(c) and 16(e) have been established, but AG ¶ 16(d) has not been established. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from personal conduct. AG ¶ 17(d) may apply if  
 
the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to 
change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.  
 
Also, AG ¶ 17(e) may apply if “the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or 
eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.”  
AG ¶¶ 17(d) and 17(e) apply. For the reasons fully set forth in my analysis 
pertaining to financial considerations, Applicant has embraced the paradigm of timely 
income tax return filing and vows not to make that same mistake in the future. With his 
new-found understanding of his legal responsibilities, and his tardy 2014 filing of his 
federal income tax returns for 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, Applicant has taken positive 
steps to eliminate or avoid similar circumstances.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.39   
     
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Referring to 
procrastination, laziness, forgetfulness, and a difficulty in maintaining a budget, 
Applicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for the tax years 2009, 2010, 
2011, and 2012. He also had two accounts that became delinquent and placed for 
collection. He never registered with the SSS claiming he had never heard of it or of the 
requirement to register with it. He and his wife avoided an employer policy against 
relatives being hired when they divorced simply to skirt around the prohibition before 
remarrying after she was hired for her position. 
 
The mitigating evidence is more substantial. Although Applicant failed to timely 
file federal income tax returns for the tax years 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, he finally 
filed three of those tardy returns in February 2014 – 18 months before the SOR was 
issued, and the remaining return was filed on an unspecific date before the SOR was 
issued. He declared that he has resolved his former procrastination, laziness, and 
forgetfulness issues by adopting the paradigm of timely filing future federal income tax 
returns. As far as the delinquent credit card account, he paid that account off in June 
2013, over two years before the SOR was issued, a fact known to the drafter of the 
SOR before the SOR was issued. The small delinquent medical account was apparently 
resolved by Applicant, but he failed to submit documentation to support his contention 
that the account had been paid off. While there may still be a relatively small income tax 
balance remaining, Applicant’s most recent credit report reveals no other delinquent 
debts, and his financial problems appear to be under control. Applicant’s actions under

Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

the circumstances no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and 
good judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:40 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of ‘“meaningful track record” necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of voluntary debt 
reduction and elimination efforts, in resolving his two delinquent debts and addressing 
his tardy federal income tax issues well before the SOR was issued. Nevertheless, this 
decision should serve as a warning that Applicant’s failure to continue to timely file his 
federal income tax returns in the future will adversely affect his future eligibility for a 
security clearance.41 
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude

 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant as security officials may continue to monitor his 
finances and the timely filing of federal income tax returns, this decision, including the warning, should not be 
interpreted as a conditional eligibility to hold a security clearance. The Government can re-validate Applicant’s 
financial status at any time through credit reports, investigation, and interrogatories. Approval of a security clearance 
now does not bar the Government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to 
reconsider the security significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative 
security significance.” Nevertheless, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach 
limiting conditions, such as an interim, conditional, or probationary status, to an applicant’s security clearance. See, 
e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 
2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. 
Sep. 18, 2006); ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. June 30, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-17410 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Apr. 12, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0109 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000).

Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations 
and personal conduct concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
