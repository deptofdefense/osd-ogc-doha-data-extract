Decision

NOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Department of Defense’s (DOD) intent to deny his 
eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. Applicant has a history 
of financial problems dating back to early adulthood. However, he has made reasonable 
efforts to resolve his delinquent debts given his circumstances.  Clearance is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 19, 2015, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing 
security concerns under the financial considerations guideline.1 DOD adjudicators were 
unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s security clearance and recommended that the case be submitted to an 
administrative judge for a determination whether to revoke his security clearance.  
 
                                                          
1 This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to 
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this 
case. The AG were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). 
The AG replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On December 29, 
2015, I issued a prehearing order to the parties regarding the exchange and submission 
of discovery, the filing of motions, and the disclosure of any witnesses.2  Department 
Counsel provided documents as requested.3 At the hearing, convened on January 14, 
2016, I admitted Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 and Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) 
A through C, without objection. After the hearing, Applicant submitted AE D through H, 
which were also admitted without objection.4 I received the transcript (Tr.) on January 
22, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant, 36, has worked for a federal contractor as an aircraft egress mechanic 
since 2008. He served in the Air Force from 2001 to 2007 and was granted a security 
clearance. Applicant completed his most recent security clearance application in April 
2012, disclosing several delinquent accounts. The ensuing investigation revealed, and 
the SOR alleges: that Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in May 2013 
(SOR ¶ 1.a); that he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in February 2004 (SOR ¶ 
1.b); and, that Applicant failed to pay his federal income taxes for 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.c).5 
 
 Applicant married his first wife when he was 19 year old. He enlisted in the Air 
Force in 2001. From 2001 to 2004, he was also the sole source of income for the 
household, because his wife was in nursing school. In 2002, Applicant’s sister died 
unexpectedly and Applicant helped cover her final expenses. By the end of 2004, 
Applicant’s was a two-income household with two small children. Despite living in base 
housing, Applicant and his wife were not earning enough money to meet all of their 
financial obligations. They decided to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection because 
they believed it provided them with the best opportunity to reestablish their financial 
footing. Applicant claims that he and his wife did not live lavish lives and did not 
accumulate debt on frivolous items. The couple filed for bankruptcy protection in 
February 2004 and received a discharge in June 2004.6  
 
 After the bankruptcy, Applicant’s finances remained stable until approximately 
2008. In 2007, Applicant completed his military service and moved to another state. He 
was unemployed for four months before accepting a temporary job, earning $12 per 
hour. His wife also experienced a decrease in pay in their new location. As a result, they 
began to accumulate debt once again. Applicant relocated again for his current job 
because it paid $27 per hour, or approximately $60,000 annually. In their new location, 
Applicant’s wife was also able to earn a higher salary. Together, they earned a joint 
income of approximately $150,000. Applicant earned $60,000 and his wife earned

$90,000. With their increased income, they began to work on rehabilitating their 
finances.7  
 
 In 2009, Applicant and his wife separated, and divorced in early 2010. In the 
divorce, Applicant agreed to pay marital debts accumulated in his name. After the 
divorce, Applicant could not continue to pay all of his expenses on his income alone and 
he began to accumulate debt again. In 2010, Applicant filed his federal income tax using 
the single status. He owed a $2,600 tax liability. In 2011, Applicant made $900 in 
payments on the tax liability. The remaining amount was satisfied by the capture of his 
2011 and 2012 federal tax refunds.8  
 
In 2011, Applicant learned that his girlfriend was pregnant. He decided to begin 
saving money for the costs of another bankruptcy petition. Unable to do so, Applicant 
borrowed the money he needed from his mother. He filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy 
protection in May 2013, seeking relief from approximately $146,000 in secured debt and 
$30,000 in unsecured debt. The secured debt consisted of the $109,000 mortgage on 
his marital home, $4,000 in homeowners’ association dues, and two vehicles totaling 
$33,000. Applicant was able to sell the home in July 2015. Applicant’s share of the 
proceeds from the sale went to his Chapter 13 plan. He was also able to sell one of the 
cars. The unsecured claims were for 10 consumer credit accounts. Applicant claims that 
the credit cards were not used for unnecessary expenses, but were used mostly after 
his separation, as he tried to make ends meet on his reduced household income. Under 
his repayment plan, Applicant agreed to pay the trustee a total of $25,896, with monthly 
payments beginning in June 2013. Since then, Applicant has made 31 timely payments 
under the plan, totaling over $7,000. The bankruptcy petition will be discharged in 
2018.9 
 
Applicant now lives with his girlfriend and their young child. He currently earns 
$80,000 annually. He is current on his recurring obligations, including his child support 
payments for his two older children. After paying his bills each month, Applicant has 
approximately $600 in disposable income. He believes that he has learned a lot about 
himself and his finances as a result of his most recent bankruptcy. He wishes to 
rehabilitate his finances so that he is better able to provide for his children as they get 
older. In February 2016, Applicant took a series of finance classes with an emphasis on 
budgeting and understanding credit.10  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief

introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
Unresolved delinquent debt is a serious security concern because failure to 
“satisfy debts [or] meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of 
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
 
5 
 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified 
information.”11 Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. 
 
 The SOR alleges that Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 
2004, that he failed to pay his 2010 federal income taxes, and that he filed for Chapter 
13 bankruptcy protection in 2013. The record establishes a prima facie case that 
Applicant had a history of not meeting his financial obligations and that he demonstrated 
an inability to pay his bills.12 At 19, Applicant became financially responsible for himself 
and his wife. However, his decision to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection was 
reasonable for a financial fresh start at 25. The financial decisions he made during 
those early years of his adulthood and marriage are not indicative of his current security 
worthiness.13  
 
Applicant’s most recent financial problems were caused by the dissolution of his 
marriage in 2010, an event beyond his control. His decision to resolve his debt through 
a Chapter 13 bankruptcy payment plan was a responsible one, given the nature of the 
debt.14  Applicant has disposed of 82% of the secured debts in the bankruptcy petition, 
the marital home ($109,000) and a car ($11,000), paying the proceeds from the sale of 
the home into the payment plan. Since filing the petition, Applicant has made 31 timely 
payments under the plan. With his debts being resolved through bankruptcy and his 
recent completion of personal finance classes, Applicant’s finances appear to be under 
control.15 While Applicant did pay his 2010 federal income tax liability late, he resolved 
the debt by 2012, three years before the SOR was issued. There is no further indication 
that Applicant has either failed to file his federal tax returns or pay any federal tax 
liability since then. 
 
After reviewing the record, I have no doubts about his suitability for access to 
classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-
person factors at AG ¶ 2(a). Applicant has not exhibited behaviors that are indicative of 
an inability to properly handle or safeguard classified information. While his financial 
record is not perfect, he is taking steps toward rehabilitation through his Chapter 13 
payment plan.

 Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.c:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is granted.
