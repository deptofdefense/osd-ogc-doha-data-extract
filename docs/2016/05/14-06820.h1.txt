Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for
access to classified information. He met his burden to present sufficient evidence to
explain and mitigate the concern stemming from his failure to timely file state and
federal individual income tax returns. In addition, the evidence shows he has made an
overall good-faith effort to repay back taxes. Accordingly, this case is decided for
Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on October 1, 2012.  After reviewing the application and1
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).     
2
(DOD),  on July 27, 2015, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it2
was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him
eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint. It3
detailed the reasons for the action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for
financial considerations. He answered the SOR in writing on August 26, 2015, and
requested a hearing.         
The case was assigned to me on December 1, 2015. The hearing was held as
scheduled on January 8, 2016. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on
January 14, 2016.
Post-hearing Matters
The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional documentation
concerning his tax problem with the IRS. It was kept open until January 25, 2016,  then
extended for an additional week, and matters were timely received. Subsequently, on
May 4, 2016, Applicant requested that the record be reopened for submission of
additional matters, and that request was granted without objections. 
Upon further review, it became apparent that Applicant’s last submission omitted
one of three attachments. On May 17, 2016, I requested Applicant’s counsel submit the
missing attachment, which he did on the same day, along with two additional
documents. 
Altogether, Applicant’s post-hearing documentation consists of the following eight
items:
• Exhibit N–IRS notices for payment of installment agreement for November
and December 2015 (eight pages).
• Exhibit O–IRS account transcript for tax years 2009 and 2010 (six pages).
• Exhibit P–Declaration of Applicant, dated January 30, 2016 (one page).
• Exhibit Q–IRS notice for payment of installment agreement for March
2016 (two pages).
• Exhibit R–IRS notice of application of overpayment for tax year 2015 to an
amount owed for tax year 2010, dated April 25, 2016 (two pages).

• Exhibit U–IRS letter denying request for abatement for tax year 2009,
dated May 9, 2016 (two pages). 
Although Department Counsel, graciously, did not object to any of the post-
hearing documentation, she did submit additional argument for my consideration. Her
three-page memorandum is made part of the record as Appellate Exhibit I.   
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 57-year-old editor for an organization that does research and
development for the federal government.  He is an experienced researcher, editor, and4
writer.  His education includes a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree, both in the5
liberal arts, from two prominent universities. He married for the first time in 2003,
separated in 2006, and divorced in 2007. He married for the second time in late 2012.
Outside of work, he and his spouse are active in various volunteer or community service
organizations.  
Applicant’s spouse is a full-time employee of an international organization. She
testified persuasively that (1) she was aware of her husband’s tax problems before they
married; (2) they have filed joint tax returns annually since tax year 2012; (3) she
insisted that they file the returns in a timely fashion, and they have used a professional
tax preparer to do so; (4) she described herself as “very frugal”; (5) she uses a spending
tracker to monitor their expenses; and (6) she is in charge of the household finances,
which are paid from a joint household account, although they each have an individual
account.  6
Applicant has worked for his current employer since July 2012.  Before that, he7
worked as an editor for a professional association from November 2007 to July 2012.
He was unemployed during October–November 2007. Before that, he worked as an
editor for an institute during 1995–2007. During April–September 2007, his employment
status was restructured from an employee to a self-employed contractor under a
nonrenewable six-month contract.

sequence of events leading up to his tax problems. 
 Tr. 41–43. 15

Applicant presented substantial evidence of a good employment record as well
as his good character and suitability for a security clearance.  For 2016, he received a8
pay raise as a result of the 2015 performance evaluation. His current annual salary is
about $84,750. His spouse earns about $48,000 annually, which is tax-free based on
her employment status.  He estimated their net worth at about $100,000.  He and his9 10
spouse bought a home for $430,000 in 2014, and they are current and in good standing
with the mortgage loan. Besides three paid collection accounts to the same
telecommunications company, credit reports from 2012, 2014, and 2015 show no
delinquent or past-due accounts.  Applicant presented a December 2015 credit report,11
which includes a credit score of 701, which is considered good.  12
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant owed the IRS $17,239 in back
taxes for tax years 2008 through 2010; that he failed to timely file an individual federal
income tax return for tax year 2011; and that he failed to timely file individual state
income tax returns for tax years 2007 through 2010. He disclosed all of these matters in
response to questions in Section 26 of his security clearance application.  Currently,13
the documentary evidence shows Applicant has repaid the back taxes to the IRS and he
has filed the delinquent federal and state returns. The details are discussed below. 
Applicant was candid and forthcoming in completing his security clearance
application. In Section 24 of the application, he disclosed he was an active alcoholic
from 1996 to March 2007, describing himself as a daily maintenance drinker resulting in
his life becoming increasingly unmanageable.  His alcohol problem progressed to the14
point where his first wife asked him to leave and she filed for divorce. He also stated
that he believes his drinking contributed to his loss of employment with the institute in
2007. 
By way of explanation, Applicant stated that 2007 was a difficult year for him
financially.  He became a self-employed contractor for six months, was unemployed for15
about two months, and then was employed at a lower level of compensation. He went

from earning an annual salary of $80,000 at the beginning of 2007 to earning an annual
salary of $60,000 in 2008. His adjusted gross income for 2008 was $58,680.  In16
addition, he had a 5 percent reduction in pay in 2008 or 2009 due to the financial crisis.
Before 2007, his first wife had assumed responsibility for filing of income tax returns.
Due to his self-employment status for six months in 2007, income taxes were not
withheld from his salary. He was also carrying debt that he had incurred during his
marriage and on his own, and he disclosed those debts in his security clearance
application.17
Applicant obtained two loans from his 401(k) or 403(b) retirement account to
resolve his indebtedness.  The combined monthly payment on the two loans was18
unmanageable, and he defaulted. The loans were then considered premature
withdrawals and thus taxable income. The result was his adjusted gross income
increased to $107,944 and $84,334 for 2009 and 2010, respectively.  His income19
returned to normal in 2011 with an adjusted gross income of $57,241.  He estimated20
owing the IRS $17,239 for tax year 2009 and $1,687 for tax year 2010.21
Turning to the matters in the SOR, Applicant failed to timely file federal and state
returns for tax year 2007.  He delayed filing the federal return because of complications22
caused by his self-employment income and unemployment compensation. He delayed
filing the state return because he first needed to verify his federal tax liability. From this
point forward, things appear to have snowballed, and he failed to  timely file federal
returns for 2008, 2009, and 2011, and he failed to timely file state returns for 2008,
2009, and 2010.  A review of IRS account transcripts shows the following: (1) he filed23
the 2008 return in November 2010 after obtaining an extension of time to file in October
2009, and he was assessed a penalty for the late filing; (2) he filed the 2009 return in
July 2010, and he was assessed a penalty for the late filing; (3) he timely filed the 2010
return; and (4) he filed the 2011 return in July 2013 after obtaining an extension of time
to file in October 2012, and he was assessed a penalty for the late filing.   24

Applicant addressed his tax problem through an installment agreement with the
IRS in November 2010.  He agreed to resolve his account for tax years 2007 and 200925
by making a monthly payment of $500 beginning in December 2010. The installment
agreement was revised or modified in May 2012. The revised agreement was for tax
years 2008, 2009, and 2010, and the monthly payment was reduced to $326. 
IRS records establish that account balances were reduced through a
combination of payments by Applicant and application of overpayment of taxes from
subsequent tax years (the refund was intercepted and used to pay down back taxes).
As of January 2014, tax years 2008 and 2011 had account balances of $0.  In26
February 2014, a $5,519 refund from his 2013 return was applied to 2009, which
reduced the account balance to $15,644.  In March 2014, a $4,351 refund from his27
2012 return was applied to 2009, which reduced the account balance to $11,183.  An28
annual installment agreement statement for the period of July 2014 to July 2015 shows
Applicant made 12 monthly payments of $326 or $400 for total payments of $4,578,
which reduced the account balance for 2009 to $9,621, while the account balance for
2010 was $4,897.  He continued to make the monthly payments during July–December29
2015.  As of October 2015, the 2009 account balance was $4,366, and the 201030
account balance was $5,231, for a total of $9,597.31
Applicant’s post-hearing documentation establishes that the account balances for
tax years 2009 and 2010 are now $0.  The account balances were paid off through a32
combination of payments by Applicant, an abatement of $1,716 in penalties for tax year
2007, and an application of overpayment of $4,969 in taxes for tax year 2015, all of
which were used to pay off the back taxes, penalties, and interest.  
Applicant has also resolved the outstanding tax matters with the state.  He filed33
tax returns for 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 in December 2012. The returns were
processed by the state in January 2013. The state tax department then issued
assessments. By October 2015, he had paid the following total amounts to resolve the

Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As34
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt35
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An36
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  37
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting38
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An39
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate40
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  41
In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a
preponderance of the evidence.  The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s42

financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In

reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence
standard.43
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it44
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant45
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 46
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  47
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
 AG ¶ 19(a) and (c). 48
 AG ¶ 19(g). 49
 AG ¶ 20(a)–(f).50

The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of not meeting
his tax obligations as required by law.  Likewise, the evidence supports a conclusion48
that Applicant failed to file annual state and federal income tax returns for a number of
years, which is a serious matter.49
 In mitigation, I have considered the six mitigating conditions under Guideline F.50
And the following mitigating conditions are most pertinent: 
AG ¶ 20(c) [t]here are clear indications that the problem is being resolved
or is under control; and
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
Applicant has provided sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate his failure to
meet his tax obligations. I reach that conclusion for the following reasons. First, he self-
reported the information about his tax problems and he has been truthful and complete
during the security-clearance process. Second, Applicant has been working on resolving
his tax problems since 2010, when he first entered into an installment agreement with
the IRS. His efforts began well before he knew he would be applying for a security
clearance in 2012. This circumstance indicates he was acting in good faith and not
merely for his own self interests in obtaining a security clearance. Third, his efforts
continued over a period of years until he filed all the belated returns and repaid the state
in 2015 and the IRS in 2016. Fourth, Applicant has learned his lesson and the likelihood
of recurrence is acceptably low. I reach that conclusion based on the active role his
spouse is playing in their household finances, their use of a professional tax preparer,
and the timely filing of joint returns since tax year 2012. Applicant’s spouse was an
impressive witness, and it was clear to see that she has a firm grasp on their household
finances. Fifth, Applicant’s overall financial situation is stable. Together, he and his
spouse have an annual gross income of about $130,000, they were able to obtain a
sizeable mortgage loan in 2014 to purchase their home, and they have a positive net
worth of about $100,000. Those circumstances provide the type of financial stability that
will allow Applicant to prosper financially, as opposed to struggling with indebtedness,
which appears to have been the genesis of his tax problems. Accordingly, I conclude
that there are clear indications that Applicant’s tax problems are resolved and under
control, and that he made a good-faith effort to repay the back taxes.    
Applicant’s history of not meeting his tax obligations as required by law no longer
creates doubt about his reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect
classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).51
10
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice
versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I51
conclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified
information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.c: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
