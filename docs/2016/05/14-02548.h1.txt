Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his eligibility for
access to classified information. He presented sufficient evidence to explain the foreign
influence concern stemming from his family ties to China. But he has financial problems
that are largely unresolved and ongoing. Accordingly, this case is decided against
Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on April 11, 2011.  Thereafter, on November 7, 2014, after1
reviewing the application and information gathered during a background investigation,
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

the Department of Defense (DOD)  sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR),2
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to a3
complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action under the security guidelines known as
Guideline B for foreign influence and Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant
timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing.
The case was assigned to me on September 18, 2015. The hearing was held as
scheduled on November 13, 2015, and December 14, 2015. At the first session in
November I sua sponte continued the case because I was concerned Applicant was
unprepared and was having difficultly hearing in a large courtroom.  Applicant was given4
an additional 30 days to prepare, and the second session in December was held in a
small conference room. 
Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1–10, and they were admitted. Applicant
offered Exhibits A–E, and they were admitted. The hearing transcripts (Tr.) were
received on November 24, 2015, and December 22, 2015, respectively.   
The record was kept open until December 31, 2015, to allow Applicant to submit
additional documentation. No post-hearing exhibits were received.  
Procedural Matters
Administrative or official notice was taken of certain facts concerning the
People’s Republic of China (China) as set forth in Department Counsel’s rather
extensive written request.  The most pertinent of those facts are the following: (1) China5
is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party is the paramount
authority; (2) China is actively engaged in intelligence gathering (industrial and military)
that targets U.S. information and technology; and (3) China has a poor record of human
rights regarding respect for the integrity of the person (e.g., freedom from arbitrary or
unlawful deprivation of life, disappearance, torture, and arbitrary arrest or detention),
respect for civil liberties, respect for political rights, corruption and lack of transparency

in government, worker rights, as well as discrimination, societal abuses, and trafficking
in persons. The maltreatment and oppression of the people of Tibet is but one example
of China’s poor record of human rights. 
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 67-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security
clearance. He is employed as a data-operations analyst for a large aerospace company.
He has worked for the same company since 1989. He was unemployed from February
2012 to October 2013 due to a reduction in force.  He was earning about $102,0006
when he was laid off in 2012; he was rehired in 2013 at a lower salary; and his current
salary is now about $65,000.7
Applicant married for the fourth time in 2008. He has six children and one
stepchild. His household consists of his spouse and four minor children, including a 16-
year-old stepson. His 42-year-old spouse is a native of China. She immigrated to the
United States in 2003. He met her in 2004. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in
December 2014, and she obtained a U.S. passport in 2015.  Applicant does not believe8
his wife was ever employed by the Chinese government, although she worked as a high
school English teacher for about a year.  She is not employed outside the home. His9
stepson immigrated to the United States in 2009, and he became a naturalized U.S.
citizen recently.  His stepson is a student at a public high school. 10
Applicant has a mother- and father-in-law who are citizens of and residents in
China.  His mother-in-law is in her 70s. He understands she was employed as an11
accountant for a department store. His father-in-law is in his 70s. Applicant understands
he was employed as a physics teacher at a local school. Applicant has never met his in-
laws or spoken to them over the telephone since he does not speak Chinese. Applicant
has never traveled to China, and his in-laws have not traveled to the United States.
Applicant’s spouse visited China when their children were young. She has twice monthly
telephone calls with her mother, but speaks to her father about once a year, as her
parents are living separately. Applicant does not provide financial support to his in-laws.
Other than a sister, his spouse has no contact with other people living in China. She has
a distant relationship with and rarely speaks to her sister. Applicant understands that his

in-laws know that he works for an aerospace company, but they are unaware that he
holds a security clearance.
Applicant has a history of financial problems. Related to that history is his divorce
from his third wife in 2008, which was preceded by a period of separation going back to
2004.  He was supporting two families at one point during this lengthy period of12
separation. Also related to that history is his period of unemployment in 2012–2013.  
The SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts in amounts ranging from $64 to $39,317,
for a total amount of about $95,000. The SOR also alleges two Chapter 13 bankruptcy
cases, both of which were dismissed in 2013. These matters are established by
Applicant’s admissions and explanations as well as the documentary evidence.  The13
indebtedness is unresolved, and the individual matters are discussed below.
SOR ¶ 2.a concerns an unpaid $30,317 judgment.  Applicant incurred this14
judgment after he was laid off in 2012. The judgment was filed in February 2013, about
a month after the initial Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was dismissed in January 2013.
He stated that he made some efforts to communicate with the creditor; he has made no
payments on the judgment since returning to work in 2013; and the judgment is
unresolved.  
SOR ¶ 2.b concerns an unpaid $2,963 judgment.  Applicant incurred this15
judgment in 2009. He attributed the debt to his third wife who opened a credit card
account in his name without his knowledge. He stated that the debt was settled in July
or August 2015 for $1,800, but had no supporting documentation. The judgment
appears as unpaid in the most recent July and November 2015 credit reports.  The16
judgment is unresolved.
SOR ¶ 2.c concerns a $3,285 charged-off credit card account.  Applicant17
thought this account might be related to the judgment in SOR ¶ 2.b, but he had no
documentation. The debt is unresolved.
SOR ¶ 2.d concerns a $635 charged-off credit card account.  The debt is18
unresolved.

unresolved.
SOR ¶ 2.f concerns a $64 collection account.  Applicant stated that he sent the20
creditor a check, but he had no documentation. The debt is unresolved.
SOR ¶ 2.g concerns a $506 collection account.  Applicant stated that he has a21
dispute with the original vendor, but he had no documentation. The debt is unresolved.
SOR ¶ 2.h concerns a $535 medical collection account.  The debt is unresolved.22
SOR ¶ 2.i concerns a $955 medical collection account.  The debt is unresolved.23
SOR ¶ 2.j concerns a $77 medical collection account.  The debt is unresolved. 24
SOR ¶ 2.k concerns a $39,317 charged-off account.  Applicant stated that he25
believes this debt may be the same debt as the judgment in SOR ¶ 2.a, but he had no
documentation. The debt is unresolved.
SOR ¶ 2.l concerns a $11,572 charged-off account.  Applicant stated that the26
debt may have been incurred by his third wife without his knowledge, but he had no
documentation. The debt is unresolved. 
SOR ¶ 2.o concerns a $177 medical collection account.  The debt is unresolved.27
SOR ¶¶ 2.m and 2.n concern the two Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases, both of
which were dismissed in 2013.  Applicant sought relief in bankruptcy court in 2010,28
when he was unable to pay the required spousal support or alimony payments and

meet his other financial obligations. He filed the Chapter 13 case in December 2010;
the court confirmed a payment plan in May 2011; and he made a number of monthly
payments. He defaulted on the payment plan because of his unemployment. Included in
the case was about $297,000 in secured claims, most of which was for a mortgage
loan, and about $83,630 in unsecured claims or debts.  29
The bankruptcy trustee moved to have the case dismissed due to default by
Applicant, and the court dismissed the case in January 2013. Bankruptcy court records
show that Applicant paid a total of $46,863 during the plan; there were total expenses of
$7,106 for the plan; $39,756 was paid to a mortgage lender for the mortgage arrearage;
and no other creditors were paid.30
Applicant filed a second Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in May 2013 to prevent a
foreclosure sale of the home. Bankruptcy court records show a payment plan was never
confirmed, no payments were made, and the case was dismissed in July 2013.  The31
scheduled creditors consisted of $83,630 in unsecured claims or debts.  After dismissal32
of the bankruptcy case, Applicant was able to avoid foreclosure by a short sale of the
home in 2014.  33
Applicant and his family rent a home and will continue to do so for the
foreseeable future. He is working with a mortgage counselor to improve his credit
worthiness. To that end, he presented two credit reports, from July 2015 and November
2015. The July 2015 credit report, obtained by his mortgage counselor, shows eight
collection accounts for a total of $51,354 and the two unpaid judgments mentioned
above.  The December 2015 credit report, obtained from a different source, shows two34
medical collection accounts for $120 and $177 and the two unpaid judgments
mentioned above.   35
In addition to the delinquent debts discussed above, the credit reports reflect that
Applicant has paid and settled other accounts, to include a $15,000 judgment.  He also36
sold a 1972 Corvette for $27,000 and used the proceeds to pay down the mortgage

arrearage, repay personal loans, and cover living expenses.  He has not sold two old37
airplanes that he owns. In the first Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, the airplanes were
valued at $15,000 and $25,000, although they are probably worth less today.  About a38
year ago, he borrowed $5,000 from a 401(k) account to pay for aircraft storage.39
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As40
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt41
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An42
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  43
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting44
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An45
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate46
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme47

 AG ¶¶ 6, 7, and 8 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 51
 AG ¶ 6. 52

Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.48
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.49
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it50
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
The gravamen of the SOR under Guideline B is whether Applicant’s family ties to
China should disqualify him from eligibility for access to classified information. Under
Guideline B for foreign influence,  the suitability of an applicant may be questioned or51
put into doubt due to foreign connections and interests. The overall concern is:
Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual
has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or
induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a
way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by
any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should
consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or
financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such
considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United
States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a
risk of terrorism.52
The guideline contains several disqualifying conditions. Given the evidence of
Applicant’s family ties to China, I have considered the following disqualifying conditions: 
 Exhibit 10. 53
9
AG ¶ 7(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional
associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a
foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign
exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and
AG ¶ 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country
that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual’s
obligation to protect classified information or technology and the
individual’s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing
that information. 
Based on U.S. concerns about China as noted above, China easily meets the
heightened-risk standard in AG ¶ 7(a). This conclusion is based on the facts set forth in
Department Counsel’s administrative notice request.   53
Applicant’s family ties to China are sufficient to raise a concern. However, his
family ties to China are largely nominal or pro forma. His wife and stepson, both of
whom were born in China, are now U.S. citizens residing in the United States and are
assimilating into their surroundings. Applicant has no relationship with his spouse’s
parents. Further, the nature and frequency of the contact his spouse has with her
parents in China are not unusual or concerning. Considering the totality of facts and
circumstances, I am persuaded that Applicant’s longstanding ties to the United States
are far stronger than his family ties, through his marriage, to China. Accordingly, the
foreign influence concern is mitigated under the following conditions:
AG ¶ 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country
in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those
persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be
placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign
individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the
United States; and 
AG ¶ 8(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's
sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or
country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding
relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be
expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. 
 AG ¶¶ 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 54
 ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that “the security suitability of an applicant55
is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness or recurring
financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In
security clearance cases, “the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances
surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation
omitted). 
 AG ¶ 18.  56
10
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant54
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 55
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  56
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly compromise
classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It encompasses
concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important qualities. A
person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or
negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.  
In analyzing the facts and circumstances of Applicant’s case, I have considered
the following disqualifying conditions (AG ¶ 19) and mitigating conditions (AG ¶ 20):
AG ¶ 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the [person’s] reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(c) [t]here are clear indications that the problem is being resolved
or is under control; and
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).57
11
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
Given the substantial-evidence standard, there is sufficient evidence to raise a
concern under Guideline F as well as the disqualifying conditions mentioned above.
Applicant’s history of financial difficulties goes back to at least 2010, when he filed the
first Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. Concerning the delinquent debts in the SOR, as noted
in the findings of fact, I found all those debts, which total about $95,000, are unresolved.
That is consistent with Applicant’s July 2015 credit report, which shows $51,327 for
eight collection accounts and $33,280 for two unpaid judgments for a total of $84,607.
That’s a sizable mountain of delinquent debt, all of which is ongoing and unresolved.
I have considered the mitigating conditions mentioned above, and none,
individually or taken together, is sufficient to mitigate the security concern. Applicant’s
recent financial history is telling. It includes two Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases during
2010–2013, a short sale of a home to avoid foreclosure in 2014, and about $80,000 to
$90,000 in delinquent debt, including two unpaid judgments. These facts and
circumstances are obvious warning signs of financial distress and instability. With that
said, his marital difficulties with his third wife, his period of unemployment, and his
decreased salary are recognized as circumstances largely beyond his control that
contributed to his financial difficulties. Still, he has made little progress in repaying a
number of overdue creditors, and he does not have a realistic payment plan in place to
do so. Viewing the evidence as a whole, there are not clear indications that Applicant’s
financial problems are being resolved and under control. The evidence does not support
a conclusion that Applicant’s financial situation is on a favorable upward trend. 
 
The concerns over Applicant’s problematic financial history create doubt about
his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified
information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and
considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice
versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I57
conclude that he did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified
information.
