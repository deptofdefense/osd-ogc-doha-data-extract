GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 8, 2012, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On August 22, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial

Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 There is some confusion as to when Applicant received the SOR, for she signed 
a receipt for the SOR on September 31, 2015. The confusion arose because her 
response to the SOR was notarized with a date of September 16, 2015, two weeks 
before she supposedly received the SOR. In her answer to the SOR allegations, 
Applicant requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel 
indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on October 19, 2015. The case was 
assigned to me on October 26, 2015. A Notice of Hearing was issued on October 28, 
2015. I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 18, 2015. 
 
 During the hearing, four Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4) and ten 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE J) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on November 25, 2015. I kept the 
record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that 
opportunity. She timely submitted a number of documents, which were marked as 
Applicant exhibits (AE) K through AE Y and admitted into evidence without objection. 
The record closed on December 10, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanations a majority of the 
factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a. through 
1.c., 1.e. through 1.q., 1.t. through 1.dd., 1.oo., and 1.pp.). She denied the remaining 
allegations, also with explanations. Applicant’s answers are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and 
upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 56-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been a 
structural designer since July 2012.2 A 1977 high school graduate,3 Applicant received 
bachelor of science degrees in 1986 and 2008, a master of science degree in 2013, and 
a doctor of philosophy degree in 2015.4 She was commissioned in the Army National 
Guard in January 1982, and served honorably until she was released in March 1986, 
when she resigned her commission and enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard. Applicant 
retired honorably in the grade of chief petty officer (E-7) in April 2001.5 She has never 
held a security clearance, but apparently was processed for a secret security clearance

Conduct Medal (five awards), the Coast Guard Unit Commendation Ribbon, the 
Humanitarian Service Medal, and the Secretary’s Outstanding Unit Award Ribbon.9 
 
Financial Considerations10 
It is unclear when Applicant’s initial financial difficulties arose, but it appears that 
several factors contributed to them over a multi-year period: she assisted her mother in 
caring for her dying father until he died of cancer in 1994; she was divorced in 1995; 
she was required to pay her ex-husband child support despite the fact that their son 
continued to reside with her for five years; her ex-husband filed multiple complaints 
against her in different states seeking child support and other monies; he gave up 
custody of their son to the state, claiming Applicant was deceased; she was 
unemployed for three months in 2008 and again in 2012; she spent precious financial 
assets (commencing at a monthly rate of $1,800 in July 2005, increasing to $2,400 in 
March 2009, again to $2,600, and ending at $2,850 in June 2013, plus the cost of 
hospital visits, doctor visits, and medications) to pay for nursing home and assisted 
living care for her mother – disabled by Alzheimer’s – after Medicare denied, then 
approved, and again denied, benefits, until her mother died in 2014; and she paid for 
her mother’s funeral expenses using funds from her 401(k) retirement account. 
Applicant estimated the total cost to her for her mother’s care since 2005 was over 
$250,000.11  
As a result of the expenses caused by the above factors, Applicant found it 
difficult to continue making routine monthly payments on her accounts. Student loan 
accounts, medical accounts, and a variety of other accounts became delinquent. 
Several judgments and a tax lien were filed, and her wages were garnished. In January

2014 – a year and one-half before the SOR was issued – Applicant turned her attention 
to her financial morass. She contacted her creditors, disputed some accounts as not 
being hers, entered into some repayment agreements, and paid other accounts. Her 
student loans were consolidated and entered into the rehabilitation program.  
The SOR identified 43 purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, totaling 
approximately $88,638, which had been placed for collection, charged off, filed as liens 
or filed as judgments. Of the 43 accounts, 19 are student loans which are not identified 
by complete or even partial account numbers. Loans were churned: charged off and 
transferred to other servicing agents, or collection agents, repeatedly. The SOR refers 
to the U.S. Department of Education, and the National Student Loan Data System 
(referred to as NTLSTDNTLN), in addition to one school and one collection agent. In 
December 2015, the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) identified 21 student loans 
for Applicant, including direct consolidated unsubsidized, direct consolidated subsidized, 
Stafford subsidized, and National Direct Student Loans, specifying loan dates and 
amounts. Five of the identified student loans no longer have a balance as a result of 
Applicant’s repayment efforts.12 Applicant estimated that the combined total of her 
student loans was originally approximately $48,000.  
In August 2012, Applicant entered into a repayment agreement to pay a bi-
weekly amount of $150 towards her student loans, to commence in September 2012. 
However, at about the same time, the student loans were transferred to a collection 
agency, and in lieu of the payments, the collection agency garnished her wages at the 
bi-weekly rate of $295.59. Between January and August 2015 alone, $5,303.10 was 
garnished by that entity for the student loans. The amount garnished through the date of 
the SOR was approximately $47,800 (SOR ¶ 1.oo.). There was another garnishment, in 
the amount of $2,502, and it commenced in July 2013. Applicant estimated that her 
current student consolidated loan balance is $15,000.13 In September 2015, Applicant 
submitted a direct consolidation loan application and applied for an income-driven 
repayment plan. Her applications were accepted, and the remaining student loans were 
consolidated. The monthly payment was established at $158.65.14 Applicant’s student 
loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.c., 1.e. – 1.q., 1.aa., 1.cc., and 1.oo) appear either to have been 
resolved or they are in the process of being involved. 
Of the 43 SOR-related accounts, 8 of those were medical accounts with 
unspecified medical providers. One account, with an unpaid balance of $359.40 (SOR ¶ 
1.r.), was paid in full in September 2015.15 Another account, with an unpaid balance of 
$327.52 (SOR ¶ 1.s.), was paid in full in September 2015.16 Four accounts with unpaid

balances of $295 (SOR ¶ 1.t.), $168 (SOR ¶ 1.u.), $145 (SOR ¶ 1.v.), and $84 (SOR ¶ 
1.y.), were resubmitted to Applicant’s health insurance company for proper processing 
because Applicant was of the opinion that they should have been covered by her health 
insurance. She has not yet received a response to her submissions.17 Two accounts, 
with unpaid balances of $82 (SOR ¶ 1.z.) and $42 (SOR ¶ 1.bb.), were paid in full in 
August 2015.18 Applicant’s medical accounts appear either to have been resolved or 
they are in the process of being involved. 
There are three purportedly continuing delinquent accounts in various stages of 
resolution, as follows: a state income-tax lien with an unpaid balance of $847 (SOR ¶ 
1.dd.) for which Applicant entered into an installment agreement under which she 
agreed to have 17 monthly payments of $50 automatically deducted from her bank 
account, commencing in October 2015;19 and a judgment in the amount of $$1,779 for 
an account for furniture (SOR ¶ 1.ee.) for which a garnishment order was obtained and 
during the first eight months of 2015, $1,594.57 was garnished from Applicant’s wages, 
indicating the account was finally paid off.20   
Additionally, there is a child-support arrearage which resulted in a judgment for 
$11,250 (SOR ¶ 1.qq.) which started when Applicant’s ex-husband sued her 
unsuccessfully in one state, then successfully in another state, he surrendered custody 
of their son to the state, claiming Applicant was dead, the garnishment of her wages, 
and her eventual success in obtaining a court order and having the arrearage removed, 
with the exception of one small state fee owed of $29.30, which was also paid off in 
December 2010.21 Those three accounts appear either to have been resolved or they 
are in the process of being involved. 
Applicant has several accounts that had either already been resolved or the 
circumstances of the account were so unusual that they should be considered resolved. 
There is an automobile loan with a high credit of $4,035 and an unpaid and past-due 
balance of $4,418 that was charged off (SOR ¶ 1.d.) when Applicant continued to make 
her routine monthly payments to the automobile dealer who sold the loan to another 
company. Neither company informed Applicant of the transfer, and her payments were 
never forwarded. The dealer went out of business. Applicant has been in discussions 
with a representative of the successor company, and they are trying to come to some

arose when Applicant was sending her payments to her ex-husband, but he refused her letters, instead returning 
them to her unopened. She set up a trust in the name of her son and made the payments to it. When the judgment 
was filed, Applicant started making additional monthly payments to her ex-husband until the matter was resolved.

resolution. Applicant still has physical possession of the vehicle, but does not hold the 
title.22 There is an electric utility bill with an unpaid amount of $129 (SOR ¶ 1.w.) that 
remained when Applicant moved. She made arrangements to pay the bill in September 
2015 and did so.23 She claims that the listing is no longer on her current credit report.24 
There is a judgment against Applicant for $1,900 (SOR ¶ 1.ff.) which arose from her 
son’s purchase of a used vehicle (Applicant did not co-sign the note) that had a 
defective transmission. Her son refused to pay for the defective vehicle and the private 
seller chose to sue Applicant. Applicant contends her son is currently making payments 
to the seller.25 There is a municipal camera-generated vehicle ticket received by 
Applicant’s son when he was operating her vehicle in the amount of $70 (SOR ¶ 1.nn.). 
Applicant paid the ticket because her son is unemployed.26 She claims that the listing is 
no longer on her current credit report.27 There is one common issue regarding these 
four accounts. While Applicant contended there were discussions with the creditors, 
repayment arrangements, or payments, she failed to submit any documentation to 
support her contentions. Accordingly, while she may have paid some of the accounts in 
full, and she and her son made payments on the other accounts, it is difficult to find that 
the accounts have been resolved. They appear to be in the process of being resolved.  
There are several accounts which Applicant has disputed with the credit-
reporting agencies contending that they are either not her accounts or the reports are 
incorrect regarding status or amount remaining unpaid. There is a credit card issued by 
a department store with a high credit of $695 and an unpaid and past-due balance of 
$927 (SOR ¶ 1.gg.) that was transferred to a collection agent. Applicant’s position 
regarding the account has evolved from initially claiming that she paid the account in 
2007 to eventually claiming that she never had an account with that particular creditor. 
She disputed the entry with a credit-reporting agency in September 2015.28 She 
contends the dispute was successful and that the listing was removed from her credit 
report.29 There are two credit-card accounts with past-due balances of $889 (SOR ¶ 
1.jj.) and $2,385 (SOR ¶ 1.kk.) that were transferred or sold to a debt purchaser. 
Applicant contends she never had credit cards with either of the two identified creditors. 
She disputed the entries with a credit-reporting agency in September 2015.30 She

contends that the disputes were successful and the listings were removed from her 
credit report.31 There is a cellular-telephone account with an unpaid and past-due 
balance of $1,139 (SOR ¶ 1.ii.). Applicant claims that while she had one account, she 
paid it off when she switched carriers, but this listing refers to a second account with the 
same creditor. She disputed the entry with a credit-reporting agency in September 
2015.32 She contends the dispute was successful and that the listing was removed from 
her credit report.33 There are two separate utility accounts with the same creditor with 
unpaid and past-due balances of $658 (SOR ¶ 1.ll.) and $81 (SOR ¶ 1.mm.) that were 
charged off. Applicant contends that before she moved out of the residence, she called 
the utility to settle her final bill, and that any subsequent charges are not her 
responsibility but the responsibility of the subsequent tenant. She disputed the entry 
with a credit-reporting agency in September 2015.34 She contends the disputes were 
successful and that the listings were removed from her credit report.35 There is one 
common issue regarding these six accounts. While Applicant contended her disputes 
were successful and the listings were removed from her credit report, she failed to 
submit any documentation to support her contentions. Accordingly, while she may have 
successfully disputed the accounts, it is difficult to find that the accounts have been 
removed from her credit report or that they have been resolved. Nevertheless, they 
appear to be in the process of being resolved.  
There is another purportedly delinquent account related to the purchase of a 
used vehicle with a high credit of $12,527. She had made two payments before the car 
failed. Applicant was driving the vehicle when it stopped. It was supposedly repaired by 
the seller, but it again stopped, this time on the interstate highway. Since it was not in a 
safe or operable condition, she told the seller that she wanted a refund and no longer 
wanted the vehicle. The vehicle was reported as having been repossessed. The 
account was transferred or sold to another company, and the unpaid balance and past-
due balance was reported as $12,336 (SOR ¶ 1.hh.). In 2008, having engaged the 
professional services of an attorney, Applicant filed a lawsuit against the successor 
creditor. The matter has not yet been resolved because the creditor has employed 
some delaying tactics by failing to appear in court on numerous occasions.36 Applicant 
failed to submit any documentation to support her contentions related to the account.  
In November or December 2015, Applicant started working with a certified 
financial counselor in the military facility financial-readiness program. Some of their joint 
efforts resulted in successful disputes regarding some of the above-listed accounts.37

Although Applicant indicated she would submit a personal financial statement setting 
forth her net monthly income; her monthly household expenses; and her monthly debt 
payments, she failed to do so. In the absence of such information, I am unable to 
determine if she has any monthly remainder available for savings or spending. This 
makes it more difficult to determine if Applicant’s finances are under control or if she is 
still experiencing financial difficulties. However, she did submit one earnings statement 
which indicated that during one two-week period in August 2015, her net pay was 
$1,350.32 which, if extrapolated over a period of one year, would be approximately 
$35,108.38 She also is receiving her military retirement and disability income. She has 
no other delinquent accounts. 
Work Performance and Character References 
 Applicant’s three most recent annual performance evaluations indicate that she 
consistently meets (the first two evaluations) or frequently exceeds (the most current 
evaluation) all goals.39 Her supervisor said that Applicant has demonstrated an 
exceptional work ethic, and noted that she is “passionate about community service as 
she consistently participates and volunteers with various organizations throughout the 
[local] community.”40 A co-worker characterized Applicant’s work ethic as exemplary.41 
Applicant’s landlord characterized her as a model tenant who is very responsible, 
reliable, and trustworthy.42 Applicant is a trained member of the county emergency 
response team.43 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”44 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”45

When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”46 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.47  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”48  
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”49 Thus, nothing

in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a “history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems arose over a multi-year period, 
perhaps as early as 1994 or 1995. Student loans went into a default status, and medical 
bills and various other accounts, including child support, became delinquent. Accounts 
were placed for collection, charged off, or went to judgment. A tax lien was filed. A 
vehicle was repossessed. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
 
11 
                                      
 
resolve debts.”50 Under AG ¶ 20(e) it is potentially mitigating if “the individual has a 
reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the 
problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) apply. Applicant’s financial problems 
were not caused by her frivolous or irresponsible spending, and she did not spend 
beyond her means. Instead, those financial problems were largely beyond her control. 
She assisted her mother in caring for her dying father; she was divorced in 1995; her 
ex-husband’s actions and activities with respect to the custody of their son were costly; 
she was unemployed for three months in 2008 and again in 2012; she spent 
approximately $250,000 to pay for nursing home and assisted-living care for her 
mother; and she paid for her mother’s funeral expenses.  
Applicant prioritized her assets and financial responsibilities. While focused 
primarily on the welfare of her mother and her son, she did, nevertheless, manage to 
pay attention to her student loans in 2012 – three years before the SOR was issued. 
With limited assets remaining after her first two priorities, she attempted to address, first 
the student loans, and then the remaining accounts. The student loans were 
consolidated. Some creditors were unwilling to wait their turn, and they resorted to 
judgments and garnishments. Others worked with Applicant. Various accounts were 
paid off or otherwise resolved. Applicant filed disputes pertaining to some accounts, 
and, for the most part, the disputes were successful. A few accounts remain unresolved, 
but Applicant has indicated an intention to eventually resolve them. 
In late 2015, Applicant reached out for guidance from a financial counselor. With 
no new delinquent accounts appearing in her credit reports, there are substantial 
indications that Applicant’s financial problems are finally under control. Applicant’s 
actions, under the circumstances confronting her, do not cast doubt on her current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.51 
  
                                                          
50
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating 
condition].

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.52       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant’s 
student loans fell into a default status; various accounts became delinquent, were 
charged off, or became judgments; a vehicle was repossessed; a tax lien was filed; and 
her child support fell into arrearage. Her wages were garnished.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant is a military veteran as well as a good and involved daughter and parent. She 
has an outstanding reputation in the workplace and in the community in which she has 
resided. Well before the SOR was issued, despite having very limited financial 
resources available, Applicant started addressing her delinquent accounts. She reached 
out to various creditors. Some agreed to repayment plans, and those accounts were 
resolved. Other accounts were resolved through garnishment. While Applicant failed to 
submit documentation to support some of her contentions, given her reputation for 
outstanding ethics, honesty, and trustworthiness, I have concluded that there are 
substantial indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control for there are 
no other delinquencies. Her actions under the circumstances confronting her do not cast 
doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:

Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
 
13 
                                      
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 53 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts, and she started to do so years before the SOR was issued. This 
decision should serve as a warning that Applicant’s failure to continue her resolution 
efforts regarding her remaining delinquent accounts, or the creation of additional 
delinquent accounts, will adversely affect her future eligibility for a security clearance.54 
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial considerations. 
See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

54
 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant as security officials may continue to monitor 
her finances, this decision, including the warning, should not be interpreted as a conditional eligibility to hold a 
security clearance. The Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit reports, 
investigation, and interrogatories. Approval of a security clearance now does not bar the Government from 
subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the security significance of past 
conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative security significance.” Nevertheless, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach limiting conditions, such as an interim, 
conditional, or probationary status, to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 
(App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 
06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006); ISCR Case No. 04-

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR 
and amended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.qq:   For Applicant 
     
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
