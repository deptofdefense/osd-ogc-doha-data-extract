FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on April 10, 2014. On 
August 20, 2015, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD 
CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under 
Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006.  
 
 Applicant answered the SOR on September 22, 2015, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on 
December 21, 2015, and the case was assigned to me on January 12, 2016. On 
January 15, 2016, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified 
 
2 
 
Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for February 5, 2016. I convened the hearing 
as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without 
objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through I and 1 
through 29, which were admitted without objection.1 I kept the record open until March 
7, 2016, to enable him to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted 
AX J through P, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript 
(Tr.) on February 16, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.f and 1.g-1.i. He 
denied SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are 
incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 53-year-old network security operations manager employed by 
federal contractors since 1997. He joined the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) in 1983. After 
graduating from college in 1987 with a degree in computer science, he served on active 
duty from 1987 to 1996. After he was released from active duty, he remained in the 
USAR, attaining the rank of colonel, until he retired on January 1, 2016. (Tr. 35.) He 
was mobilized and deployed to Kuwait and Iraq from August 2006 to August 2007. He 
was mobilized again from February 2008 to January 2011 and assigned to duty stations 
in the United States. He was mobilized in August 2012, served in Afghanistan until June 
2013, and served in the United States until October 2013. (AX 1; AX 2.) He has held a 
security clearance for almost 30 years. 
 
 Applicant consistently received strong officer evaluation reports as a USAR 
officer. (AX 19-24.) He deferred completion of the non-resident Army War College 
course to deploy to Afghanistan as the deputy commander of a signal unit. He applied 
for reinstatement in the course upon his return and was supported by the commanding 
general of his deployed unit and another general officer. (AX 26 and 27.) 
 
Applicant married in May 1990, separated in February 2008, and divorced in 
June 2014. He and his ex-wife have two adult children, ages 26 and 22. (GX 1 at 23.) 
His ex-wife has a 34-year-old son from a previous relationship. Applicant delayed filing 
his petition for divorce to enable him and his wife to complete 20 years of marriage and 
thereby make his wife eligible for military benefits when he retired from the USAR. (Tr. 
46.) 
 
 The SOR alleges nine delinquent debts. The evidence concerning these debts is 
summarized below. 
 
                                                          
1 AX 1 through 29 contain Applicant’s biographical data and character references. AX A through I address 
the merits of SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.i, with each exhibit keyed to an SOR subparagraph. AX J through P 
update the information submitted at the hearing. 
 
3 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a: medical bill for $120. This debt became delinquent in January 2011. 
It was placed for collection in February 2013, while Applicant was deployed to 
Afghanistan. (GX 7 at 1.) Applicant paid the debt in full on February 2, 2016. (AX A.) 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.e: second mortgage on marital home, past due for 
$15,954; and home-mortgage loan in foreclosure with a balance of about 
$440,910. Applicant and his wife purchased the marital home in October 2004 for 
$530,000. They financed the purchase with two loans. One loan was for $468,800, 
secured by a first mortgage, and the other was for $58,602, secured by a second 
mortgage. (GX 3 at 6.) The loan secured by the first mortgage was for a fixed interest 
rate for the first five years and then became a variable-rate loan. After the initial five 
years, the interest rate increased significantly. (Tr. 148.) The loan payments were 
automatically deducted from a joint account. (Tr. 40-42; GX 2 at 5.)  
 
Before Applicant was recalled to active duty in 2008, he was earning about 
$55,000 per year from his civilian employer and about $22,000 as a member of the 
USAR. His wife earned about $25,000-$30,000 per year. (Tr. 46-47.)  
 
When Applicant and his ex-wife separated, she remained in the marital home, 
and Applicant established a separate household. They kept their joint bank account, but 
each also opened a separate bank account. Applicant deposited sufficient funds in the 
joint account to cover the loan payment and his wife’s household expenses. In 2011, 
Applicant was notified that he had missed three payments on the home loan. He 
suspected that his then wife diverted the funds he had deposited in the joint account, 
but she denied it. (Tr. 148-51.) He could not afford to make up the three payments. He 
invoked the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to preclude foreclosure, since he was on 
active duty. He applied for refinancing the loan under the Home Affordable Mortgage 
Program (HAMP) and some other federal government programs. At this point, the 
housing market had collapsed and he owed more than the house was worth.  
 
Processing the application for a HAMP refinancing was complicated by 
Applicant’s deployment to a combat zone. Their divorce had become contentious, and 
his wife was uncooperative. They missed the first deadline for a HAMP refinancing, and 
their second attempt was pending when Applicant returned from Afghanistan in July 
2013. The second HAMP application was denied because Applicant’s income was too 
high. (Tr. 152.) Applicant’s civilian employer transferred him to another location farther 
away from the marital home, where he established a separate residence.  
 
The home was flooded by a broken water pipe in March 2015 and required 
repairs costing about $22,676. (AX 7.) In June 2015, Applicant’s insurance company 
issued a check for about $73,000 to cover the repairs as well as other damage 
attributed to broken water pipe. The check was payable to Applicant, his ex-wife, and 
the mortgage lender. The mortgage lender was unwilling to endorse the check to enable 
Applicant to pay the contractor who repaired the damage. At one point, the lender lost 
the check, forcing Applicant to arrange for another check to be issued. (AX 9 at 2.) It 
 
4 
 
took Applicant and his attorney until January 2016 to obtain the endorsement of the 
mortgagor’s authorized agent on the check.  
 
Applicant was hoping for a short sale of the home after it was repaired. However, 
this option was preempted when the mortgage lender foreclosed on the home in May 
2015. (AX 9 at 1.) The balance due after the foreclosure sale was $189,992. (AX 9.) On 
January 25, 2016, the mortgage lender paid the contractor $22,676 for the repairs and 
applied $51,073 to the deficiency balance due after the foreclosure sale. (AX 9-17.) On 
February 10, 2016 (five days after the hearing), the lender offered a settlement for 
$138,958. (AX J; AX K.)  
 
 The second mortgage loan became delinquent in June 2012, with a balance due 
of $40,027. (GX 7 at 4.) As of February 11, 2016, the amount past due was $20,616, 
and the outstanding principal was $40,027. (AX L.) As of March 4, 2016, the lender 
computed the current payoff balance to be $50,385. At the time of the hearing, 
Applicant and his attorney are gathering documentation (W-2 forms, several months of 
checking account statements, two years of tax returns, and other financial statements) 
to support an offer to resolve the outstanding loan for a lesser amount. (AX J.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c: credit-card account charged off for about $1,036. This joint 
account was opened by Applicant and his ex-wife in August 2000. It first became 
delinquent in June 2012, while Applicant was in Afghanistan. (GX 7 at 4.) Applicant paid 
this account in full in June 2015. (AX 5 at 9; AX C.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d: charged-off account, no account number, description of the 
debt, date, or amount alleged.2 After extensive research, Applicant discovered this 
account was a membership in an officer’s club where he had been stationed while on 
active duty. The club manager informed him that he never had an account with the club. 
Normal military procedures would have required Applicant to resolve any account he 
had with the officers’ club before he would have been permitted to depart from the 
installation. (Tr. 110-11.) This debt is reflected in Applicant’s CBRs as disputed with a 
high balance of $169, closed by credit grantor, and paid after being charged off. (GX 7 
at 6; AX 5 at 6.)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f: charged-off debt for $448, no account number, description of 
account, or date alleged. This account is a credit-card account. It was not listed in 
Applicant’s July 2015 CBR, but it was listed in his December 2014 CBR. It was opened 
in September 2007, and the last activity on the account was in June 2010, while 
                                                          
2 The allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g do not comply with the specificity requirement of Directive ¶ 
E3.1.3, which requires that the SOR “shall be as detailed as the national security permits.” Applicant 
denied SOR ¶ 1.g in his answer to the SOR, stating that he was unable to find any information about this 
debt. With the assistance of his attorney and extensive research, he was able to identify the specific 
debts involved in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g. Therefore, I conclude that he was not prejudiced by the 
defective SOR. It is unlikely that the typical pro se applicant could have adequately identified these debts. 
 
 
5 
 
Applicant was on active duty (GX 6 at 2; AX 1.) Applicant paid the debt in full in May 
2015. (AX F.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g: collection account for $269, no account number, date, or 
description of the debt alleged. This debt is a telephone bill referred for collection in 
January 2014. (GX 6 at 2; AX 6 at 11.) Applicant paid the debt in full on February 1, 
2016. (AX G.) He testified that he was not sure it was his debt, but he paid it to remove 
it from his credit record. (Tr. 116.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h: medical bill referred for collection for $234. This debt was 
referred for collection in March 2012. (GX 6 at 2.) Applicant paid this debt in May 2015. 
(AX H.) It is not reflected in his July 2015 CBR (GX 7.)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.i: charged-off telephone bill for $143. This debt was referred for 
collection in January 2012. (GX 6 at 2.) Applicant paid it in full on February 2, 2016, 
even though he was not sure it was his debt. (AX I; Tr. 123.) 
 
 In a personal subject interview in July 2014, Applicant disclosed that he did not 
file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2012 and 2013. He attributed 
his failure to preoccupation with the divorce. (GX 2 at 5.) He filed the returns in July 
2014, after his divorce was completed. He did not owe any federal or state taxes for 
2012 and 2013. He was entitled to a federal tax refund of $3,704 for 2013, which was 
applied to a federal tax debt for 2009. He was unaware of the tax debt for 2009 until 
December 28, 2015, when he was notified that his refund was applied to a tax debt of 
$15,162. (AX M.) He does not know how why he owed federal taxes for 2009, because 
his wife filed the 2009 returns while he was deployed. He is trying to obtain more 
information with the IRS, with a view toward resolving the debt. (Tr. 157-58; AX J at 2.) 
His failure to timely file his federal and state returns and his federal tax debt for 2009 
were not alleged in the SOR. 
 
When Applicant and his wife were finally divorced in June 2014, Applicant had 
spent about $17,000 in legal fees, including $10,000 paid to his ex-wife’s attorney. He 
was paying $4,000 per month for spousal and child support pending the divorce. The 
divorce decree required him to pay $3,000 per month in spousal support for five years. 
His daughter now lives with him, and he no longer pays child support. 
 
 Applicant’s current gross monthly pay is about $9,469. His deductions from gross 
pay, including $3,000 per month for spousal support, are about $5,192. His net monthly 
expenses are about $3,990, including his car payments, which are current. His net 
monthly income is about $1,202. His spousal support obligation will terminate in June 
 
6 
 
2019. (AX 18; Tr. 126.) His ex-wife will receive one-half of his military retired pay when 
he begins to collect it at age 56.3 (Divorce decree, attached to answer to SOR.)  
 
 Applicant owns a 9-year-old truck and a 16-year-old compact SUV. He bought 
the SUV for his daughter when she graduated from high school. (Tr. 138-29.) He has 
about $17,806 in a credit union certificate of deposit; $5,094 in his savings account; 
$4,136 in his checking account, and $1,760 in an investment account. His current 
outstanding debts are a car loan with a balance of $11,816; the deficiency after 
foreclosure of the first mortgage of $138,959; the balance due on the second mortgage 
loan of $50,385; and a federal tax debt of $15,162. (AX P.) He completed a credit-
counseling course in January 2016. (AX 25.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
                                                          
3 Retired members of the USAR generally are not eligible to receive retired pay until they reach age 60. 
However, a member of the USAR who was recalled to active duty after January 2008 has the age 
requirement reduced by three months for each cumulative of 90-day period of active duty. 
(http://militarypay.defense.gov/Pay/Retirement/Reserve.aspx.)  
 
7 
 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 
8 
 
 Applicant’s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing 
establish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts”) and AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial 
obligations”). The disqualifying condition in AG ¶ 19(g) (“failure to file annual Federal, 
state, or local income tax returns as required . . . .”) may not be an independent basis 
for denying a clearance, because it was not alleged in the SOR. However, the unalleged 
conduct may be considered to assess Applicant=s credibility; to decide whether a 
particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, 
mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether he has demonstrated 
successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-
20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered it for these limited purposes. 
 
 The following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not fully established, because Applicant’s delinquent debts were 
numerous and recent. However, Applicant’s delinquent debts were incurred when he 
was deployed to a combat zone and in the middle of a contentious divorce. He is now 
retired from the USAR and divorced, making further financial problems unlikely to recur.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is established. Applicant encountered several conditions largely 
beyond his control: the downturn in the housing market, his multiple mobilizations and 
deployment to a combat zone, the water damage to his home, his marital separation, 
and the failure of his now ex-wife to make the payments on the mortgage loans and 
household bills as agreed. After he was able to identify the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 
 
9 
 
1.d, and 1.f-1.i, he resolved them. He maintained contact with the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 
1.b and 1.e, attempted to obtain a loan modification, and was contemplating a short sale 
when the creditor foreclosed on the property. His efforts were hampered by the dilatory 
conduct of the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.b regarding the insurance settlement of the water 
damage to his home. He remains committed to resolving the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 
1.e, and he likely would have made more progress if the insurance settlement had not 
dragged on until 11 days before the hearing. He and his lawyer have maintained contact 
with the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.e. His extraordinary efforts to track down his 
creditors in spite of the vague allegations in the SOR and his track record of diligence in 
resolving most of the debts in the SOR indicate that he will continue in his efforts to 
resolve the his remaining debts.4 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is partially established. Applicant has received extensive advice from 
his lawyer and he enrolled in a credit-counseling course in January 2016. However, he 
has not had sufficient time to establish “clear evidence” that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b 
and 1.e are being resolved. His financial situation will improve substantially when he 
begins receiving military retired pay and his spousal support obligation ends.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is established for all the debts alleged in the SOR except SOR ¶¶ 1.b 
and 1.e. Applicant has not had sufficient time to negotiate a payment plan or other 
resolution of these two debts.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(e) is not established. Applicant expressed doubt that the debts alleged 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.g, and 1.i, but he submitted no documentary evidence supporting his 
debt, and he ultimately paid the debts. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
                                                          
4 Administrative judges do not have authority to grant conditional clearances. ISCR Case No. 99-0901, 
2000 WL 288429 at *3 (App. Bd. Mar.1, 2000). See also ISCR Case No. 01-24328, 2003 WL 21979745 
at *2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2003). However, If Applicant fails to continue his efforts to resolve his remaining 
delinquent debts, “[t]he Government has the right to reconsider the security significance of past conduct 
or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative security significance.” ISCR Case No. 
10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012).  
 
10 
 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant completed more than 20 years in the USAR. He was mobilized and 
deployed to combat zones three times. He has held a security clearance for almost 30 
years, apparently without incident. He was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. 
He and his attorney spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort to track down the 
vague allegations in the SOR and resolve them. He voluntarily disclosed his failures to 
timely file his tax returns. He was unaware of the federal tax debt until shortly before the 
hearing, and he is addressing it, even though it was not alleged in the SOR.  
 
 Like many deployed servicemembers, Applicant was required to entrust many 
financial responsibilities to family members. He was diligent in his efforts to provide his 
ex-wife with the benefits of being a military spouse, but his ex-wife betrayed his trust by 
failing to pay the mortgage loans and household expenses with the funds he deposited 
in their joint account.   
 
 A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-
02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) Applicant’s long service to the national defense and his 
responsible efforts to resolve his financial problems demonstrate his sound judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness.  
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. Accordingly, I conclude 
he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant continue his eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.i:    For Applicant

Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant 
eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is 
granted.
