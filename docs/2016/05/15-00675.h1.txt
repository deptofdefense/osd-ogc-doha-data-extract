HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant made sufficient progress resolving the delinquent debts listed on his 
statement of reasons (SOR). On May 15, 2015, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
indicated his federal income taxes were current, which was before the SOR was issued. 
Several non-SOR debts are paid or are in current payment plans. He is communicating 
with his creditors, and has assured he intends to pay his debts. While additional 
sustained financial effort is necessary, he has established a track record of debt 
payment and resolution. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. 
Access to classified information is granted.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On March 14, 2013, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On September 15, 2015, the 
Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an 
SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
 
2 
                                         
 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the 
SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. 
 
On October 13, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he requested a 
hearing. On November 23, 2015, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On 
January 4, 2016, the case was assigned to me. On February 8, 2016, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing 
for February 23, 2016. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by 
withdrawing SOR ¶ 1.i because the debt was paid. (Tr. 14) Applicant did not object, and 
I granted the motion. (Tr. 14) Department Counsel also moved to amend SOR ¶¶ 1.j to 
1.n to indicate Applicant did not timely file his federal tax returns. (Tr. 67) Applicant did 
not object, and I granted Department Counsel’s motion. (Tr. 67) Department Counsel 
offered 4 exhibits, and Applicant offered 10 exhibits, which were admitted into evidence 
without objection. (Transcript (Tr.) 18, 20-23; Government Exhibit (GE) 1-4; Applicant 
Exhibit (AE) A-J) On March 2, 2016, DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the 
hearing. On March 11, 2016, Applicant provided four additional exhibits, which were 
admitted without objection. (AE K-N) The record closed on March 11, 2016. (Tr. 64) 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.b through 
1.g. He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions 
are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 38 years old, and he has been employed by a defense contractor 
since 2012. (Tr. 6, 8) In 1995, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 6) In 2002, he 
received a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering; in 2011, he received a 
master’s degree in mechanical engineering; and, in 2012, he received a master’s 
degree in engineering management systems. (Tr. 6-7) He has never served in the 
military. (Tr. 7) He has never married. (Tr. 7) His daughter was born in 2000. (Tr. 7) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant attributed his financial problems to a “long, arduous battle for the 
custody” of his daughter, including legal fees, and the expense of supporting two 
households. (Tr. 17, 32-35, 40; AE D) The litigation extended from 2008 to 2010, and it 
resulted in court-ordered joint custody. (Tr. 26; AE D) In 2009 alone, his legal bill was 
about $9,000. (Tr. 45) In total, he estimated his legal fees to be about $100,000. (Tr. 45) 
By the end of 2011 with some help from his family, he had paid the debt owed to his 
lawyer. (Tr. 41) Applicant has about $100,000 in student loans, which are currently in 
forbearance status. (Tr. 29) Later in 2016, he will begin making monthly payments of 
about $850. (Tr. 30) His child support is paid by automatic payment from his salary. (Tr. 
43) His child support has never been in arrears. (Tr. 43-44) He conceded he fell behind 
on several debts in the midst of the child custody litigation. (Tr. 44-46) Applicant pays 
$10,000 annually so his daughter can attend a private preparatory school. (Tr. 57-58; 
 
3 
                                         
 
AE E at 8) He gave a higher priority to paying her tuition than he did to paying his own 
debts. (Tr. 58) 
 
Applicant communicated with the IRS about his taxes, and the IRS advised him 
that since his tax debt was modest he could arrange a payment plan. (Tr. 38) The IRS 
did not take any action to file a lien or a levy to collect back taxes. (Tr. 39) There is no 
evidence Applicant filed for any income tax filing extensions. The IRS tax transcripts for 
tax years 2006 to 2014 provide the following information (AE C, L):1

Applicant’s SOR alleges, and his SF 86, credit reports, Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), SOR response, and hearing 
record establish a history of nine delinquent debts totaling $11,310. Their status is as 
follows: 
SOR ¶ 1.a for $4,626 alleges a collection debt for a vehicle. His vehicle was 
totaled in an accident, and he had gap insurance to cover the depreciation in the 
vehicle. (Tr. 59) He did not understand why a collection company was seeking payment. 
                                            
1Applicant’s SOR in ¶¶ 1.j through 1.n alleges he failed to timely file his federal tax returns for tax 
years 2006 through 2010. He also failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2011 
through 2013. Applicant’s SOR does not allege that he failed to timely file federal income tax returns for 
tax years 2011 through 2013. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal 
Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd.

Consideration that Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2011 through 
2013, will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above.

(Tr. 59) He contacted the collection company and asked for information about the debt; 
however, the collection company was unable to find any information. (Tr. 47-48) He 
asked the credit reporting companies to delete the information about the debt from his 
credit reports. (Tr. 48) The debt does not appear on his March 20, 2013 credit report, 
May 15, 2014 credit report, or on his July 24, 2015 three bureau credit report. (GE 3; 
GE 4; AE N)   
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b for $1,884; 1.c for $1,435; and 1.h for $237 involve the same 
collection company. He paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h. (Tr. 48-49; AE F) On February 21, 
2016, he made a $191 payment to the creditor for one account and $259 to the creditor 
for another account, and he intends to make five more payments to resolve the debts. 
(Tr. 49, 61; AE F at 1) His accounts with this creditor are current. (AE F)  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d for $866 and 1.e for $636 are charged-off bank debts. Applicant 
acknowledged responsibility for these debts, and he plans to pay them when able to do 
so. (Tr. 49-50) He has maintained contact with the creditors. In February 2016, he made 
a $33 payment to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.d, and he is discussing with the creditor a 
single payment to resolve the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e. (Tr. 50-51, 61) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f for $495 is owed to a bank. On February 9, 2016, the creditor offered 
to settle the debt for $396. (Tr. 50-51; AE H) Applicant said he would attempt to pay the 
debt in March 2016. (Tr. 50-51) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g for $395 is a debt from a corporation that has been transferred to a 
collection company. (Tr. 51) He is communicating with the collection company and 
assures he will pay the debt when able to do so. (Tr. 52)  
 
Character Evidence 
 
Applicant’s employer indicated in his evaluations that he meets expectations. (Tr. 
68; AE E) He received the Outstanding Achievement Award in the fourth quarter of 
2013 for an engineering design he generated. (Tr. 69; AE E at 4) In May 2015, he was 
honored for his contributions to his employer and DOD. (AE E at 5) He tutors children in 
academics especially mathematics. (Tr. 70)      
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
5 
                                         
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;” and “(g) failure to file annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required . . . .” Applicant’s history of 
delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, SF 86, OPM PSI, SOR response, 
and hearing record. The record establishes a history of nine delinquent debts totaling 
$11,310. Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2006 
through 2010. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 
19(c), and 19(g) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and  
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
 
7 
                                         
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a) through 20(e) apply. Applicant’s financial problems resulted from 
Applicant’s efforts to gain custody of his daughter. He was unable to fully pay his federal 
income taxes and some creditors. His lengthy and expensive legal contest to ensure 
custody of his daughter ended in 2010, and it is an unusual circumstance that took 
several years to recover from financially.     
 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2006 
through 2013. The DOHA Appeal Board had commented: 
 
It is well settled that [f]ailure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant 
has a problem with complying with well-established government rules and 
systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential 
for protecting classified information.  
 
                                                                                                                                            
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-
05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)). The failure to timely file his tax returns showed 
poor judgment and a failure to timely comply with government rules.  
 
For the previous six years (2010 through 2015), Applicant withheld more funds 
than necessary to pay his federal income taxes. Those funds were applied to pay his 
federal income tax debt, which at its zenith in 2010, was about $8,000. His federal 
income tax debt was paid in March 2015, six months before he received the SOR. His 
tax returns were timely filed for tax years 2014 and 2015. 
 
Applicant reasonably disputed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a, and it does not appear in 
his 2013, 2014, or 2015 credit reports. He paid one debt; two debts are in payment 
plans that are satisfactory to the creditor; and five SOR debts totaling $3,365 remain 
unresolved. Several non-SOR debts are paid or are in current payment plans. He is 
communicating with his creditors, and has assured he intends to pay his debts. He has 
established a track record of debt payment and resolution. I am confident that Applicant 
will conscientiously endeavor to resolve his SOR debts. 
 
Based on Applicant’s credible and sincere promise to timely pay his debts, future 
new delinquent debt “is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on [Applicant’s] current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” and “there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control.” His payments of some of his debts 
showed good faith. He has sufficient income to keep his debts in current status and to 
continue making progress paying his remaining delinquent debts, although he may have 
to reduce his payments towards his daughter’s tuition to ensure his student loan debt is 
current. His efforts are sufficient to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. 
Even if Applicant provided insufficient information to mitigate security concerns under 
AG ¶ 20, he mitigated security concerns under the whole-person concept, infra. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
 
9 
                                         
 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He earned master’s 
degrees in mechanical engineering and in engineering management systems. 
Applicant’s employer indicated in his evaluations that he meets expectations. He 
received the Outstanding Achievement Award in the fourth quarter of 2013 for an 
engineering design he generated. In May 2015, he was honored for his contributions to 
his employer and DOD.  
 
Applicant’s financial problems originated from a “long, arduous battle for the 
custody” of his daughter, including legal fees, and the expense of supporting two 
households. In total, he estimated his legal fees in the child support litigation to be about 
$100,000. By the end of 2011, he had paid the debt owed to his lawyer. His child 
support, two SOR debts, and several non-SOR debts are in current payment plans.  
 
Applicant filed his federal income tax returns late for tax years 2006 through 
2013, and he failed to pay his taxes in full when he did file for tax years 2006 through 
2009. By 2010, he had accumulated a federal income tax debt of about $8,000; 
however, the IRS did not file any tax liens or levies, and Applicant maintained 
communication with the IRS. For tax years 2010 to 2014, he was entitled to federal 
income tax refunds, and his refunds were applied to pay off his tax debt. On May 16, 
2015, the IRS indicated his federal income taxes were current, which was before the 
SOR was issued on September 15, 2015.  
 
In addition, the SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totaling $11,310. He paid one 
debt; he successfully disputed one debt; two debts are in payment plans which are 
satisfactory to the creditor; and five debts totaling $3,365 remain unresolved. Several 
non-SOR debts are paid or are in current payment plans. He is communicating with his 
creditors, and has assured he intends to pay his debts. He understands that he needs 
to pay his debts, and the conduct required to retain his security clearance. The Appeal 
Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases 
stating:  
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence 
of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant 
is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments

on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted). Applicant has established a “meaningful track record” of debt 
re-payment, and I am confident he will maintain his financial responsibility.3 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.i:    Withdrawn 
Subparagraphs 1.j through 1.n:  For Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

3The Government has the option of following-up with more questions about Applicant’s finances. 
The Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit reports, 
investigation, and interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the Government from 
subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the security 
significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative security 
significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). Violation of a promise made in a 
security context to pay legitimate debts may also raise judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may 
support future revocation of a security clearance. An administrative judge does not have “authority to 
grant an interim, conditional, or probationary clearance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 
2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 04-03907 
at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006) (stating, “The Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or 
probationary security clearance to allow [the applicant] the opportunity to have a security clearance while 
[the applicant] works on [his or] her financial problems.”). This footnote does not imply that this decision to 
grant Applicant’s security clearance is conditional.
