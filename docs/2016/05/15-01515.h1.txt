Decision

HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant failed to timely file and pay his federal and state income taxes for tax 
years 2005 through 2009. His statement of reasons (SOR) lists 22 delinquent debts 
totaling $6,897. He paid 11 SOR debts, 1 SOR debt is in a payment plan, 3 SOR debts 
are disputed, and 7 SOR debts are unresolved. His federal income tax returns are now 
filed, and his federal tax debt has been reduced to about $11,000. However, his history 
of failing to timely file and pay his federal and state income taxes continues to raise 
unresolved financial considerations security concerns. Access to classified information 
is denied.  
 
History of the Case 
  
On August 7, 2012, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (e-QIP) (SF 86). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On August 28, 2015, 
the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an 
SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), 
which became effective on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF could not make the affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
 
2 
                                         
 
or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative 
judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the 
financial considerations guideline. 
 
On October 8, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. 
On January 6, 2016, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On January 21, 2016, 
the case was referred to me. On February 3, 2016, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for February 11, 2016. 
(HE 1) Applicant waived his right to 15 days of notice of the date, time, and location of 
his hearing. (Tr. 16) The hearing was held as scheduled using video teleconference 
(VTC).  
 
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits, which were 
admitted into evidence without objection. (Tr. 19-20; Government Exhibit (GE) 1-4) At 
his hearing, Applicant offered four exhibits, which were admitted without objection. (Tr.  
20-22; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-D) The transcript was received on February 19, 2016. I 
held the record open until May 1, 2016, to permit Applicant to submit additional 
documents. On May 1, 2016, Applicant provided 22 additional documents, which were 
admitted without objection. (AE E-Z)  
 
Procedural Ruling 
 
 Department Counsel moved to amend SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.e to include state income 
taxes for tax years 2005 through 2009. (Tr. 73-74) Applicant did not object, and I 
granted the motion. (Tr. 74)    
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 
1.aa. He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions 
are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old aircraft mechanic employed by a defense contractor, 
who is seeking a security clearance. (Tr. 6, 24) In 1988, he graduated from high school. 
(Tr. 7) He completed some college classes, and he did not receive a degree. (Tr. 7) He 
served on active duty in the Army from 1990 to 2001 and in the National Guard from 
2001 to 2012. (Tr. 7-8, 15) He received an honorable discharge, and he has qualified for 
retirement benefits when he is age 60. (Tr. 8; AE C) In 1990, he married, and in 1991, 
he divorced. (Tr. 8) In 1993, he married, and in 2008, he divorced. (Tr. 9, 15; GE 1) His 
son is 21 years old. (Tr. 50; GE 1)   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e allege, and the record establishes, that Applicant did not 
file his federal income taxes, as required, for tax years 2005 through 2009. He did not 
file because of a dispute over whether he or his spouse should take a deduction for their 
 
3 
                                         
 
child. (Tr. 38) He was also anxious and depressed from the loss of friends while he 
served in Iraq and his divorce. (Tr. 38, 50, 71) He was working three jobs and he was 
under great stress. (Tr. 50) The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed tax returns for 
Applicant. (Tr. 31, 36; AE A) Starting in 2007 or 2008, the IRS garnished about $225 
every two weeks of his wages for about 30 months to address his tax debt for tax years 
2002 through 2004. (Tr. 38-42)1 In about 2010, the garnishment stopped after he filed 
his 2009 or 2010 tax return. (Tr. 38-40) He timely filed his 2010 federal income tax 
return. (Tr. 41)   
 
Applicant provided IRS account transcripts for tax years 2012 through 2014. (AE 
E) Those three IRS accounts show application of refunds for each year to previous tax 
debts, and the IRS transcripts and his 2015 Form 1040EZ are summarized in the 
following table:

Applicant’s taxes owed for tax year 2004 were paid on March 14, 2011. (AE G) 
His taxes owed for tax year 2006 were paid on February 19, 2016. (AE H) As of March 
16, 2016, he owes the IRS the following amounts: $2,360 for tax year 2007 (AE I); 
                                            
1Applicant’s SOR does not allege that he failed to pay his federal income taxes as required for tax 
years 2002 to 2004. He mentioned the IRS garnishment to an Office of Personnel Management 
investigator; however, he did not indicate the garnishment predated 2005. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 
4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an 
SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 
14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). 
Consideration of the possibility that Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns and pay 
his taxes as required for tax years 2002 to 2004 will not be considered except for the five purposes listed 
above.  
 
4 
                                         
 
$4,957 for tax year 2008 (AE J); and $6,290 for tax year 2009 (AE K). Applicant 
estimated he still owes about $6,000 to the IRS (Tr. 43, 49); however, he actually owes 
about $11,000 to the IRS after he is credited $1,878 for his 2015 tax refund. He believes 
his state income tax returns were filed for tax years 2005 through 2009, and he did not 
owe any state income taxes. (Tr. 37-38) I asked him to provide evidence that his state 
taxes were filed, paid, and in current status (Tr. 45, 74). An April 18, 2016 letter from the 
state tax authority indicates no taxes are due for tax year 2012. (AE F) Applicant did not 
provide documentation addressing his state taxes for tax years 2005 through 2009.   
 
Applicant makes $125 monthly payments to address his federal income tax debt. 
(Tr. 29-30; AE A) In October 2016, he is scheduled to increase his monthly payments to 
$225. (Tr. 30)   
 
Applicant did not attempt to resolve his debts because he was reluctant to 
address them. (Tr. 52) He conceded he was financially irresponsible, and his receipt of 
the SOR motivated him to investigate and resolve his delinquent debts. (Tr. 52)2  
 
SOR ¶ 1.f is an alleged collection debt for $884. Applicant settled and paid $429 
on February 2, 2013. (Tr. 53-56; AE A at 1) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.g through 1.i are three alleged medical debts for $778, $500, and 
$465. Applicant hurt his back in a motorcycle accident. (Tr. 58-59) He is attempting to 
convince an insurance company to pay the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h. (Tr. 56) He 
assured he will pay SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h if his insurance declines to pay them. (Tr. 56) 
He said he paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i, and he provided a confirmation number. (AE B)  
 
Applicant paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.j for $395 on February 2, 2016, and 1.k for 
$290 on November 2, 2015. (Tr. 59-61; AE A at 2, 14; AE D at 22)  
 
Applicant did not resolve the seven debts owed to the creditors totaling $1,882 as 
follows: SOR ¶¶ 1.l for $89; 1.r for $50; 1.s for $123; 1.t for $51; 1.u for $79; 1.w for 
$462; and 1.aa for $1,028. (Tr. 62, 69) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.aa is about 10 years old. 
(Tr. 69) 
 
Applicant paid the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.m for $57, 1.n for $56, and 1.o for 
$27 on October 16, 2015, with a check for $137. (Tr. 65; AE D at 7) On February 4, 
2016, Applicant paid $389 and resolved the telecommunications debt in SOR ¶ 1.p for 
$513. (Tr. 63-64; AE A at 1)  
 
On October 14, 2015, Applicant contacted the telecommunications creditor for 
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.q for $149. (Tr. 62) The creditor advised the account was closed. 
                                            
2It is important to be mindful of the Appeal Board’s admonition that “an applicant who begins to 
resolve debts only after an SOR placed him on notice that his clearance was in jeopardy may lack the 
judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat 
to his own interests.” ISCR Case No. 14-05476 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-
03358 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015).    
 
5 
                                         
 
(Tr. 62) On October 16, 2015, Applicant paid the utilities debt in SOR ¶ 1.v for $158. (Tr. 
64; AE D at 7)  
 
The three debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.x for $55, 1.y for $662, and 1.z for $66 were owed 
to the same collection company. Applicant paid SOR ¶¶ 1.x and 1.z, and he is making 
$50 monthly payments to address the debt in SOR ¶ 1.y. (Tr. 66-67; AE A at 4, 8, and 
13; AE D at 8) 
  
As soon as Applicant pays a debt, he plans to use the funds to pay other debts. 
(Tr. 67) He assures he plans to pay all of his debts. (Tr. 70) Applicant’s annual income 
is about $57,500. (Tr. 24) About three months before his hearing, Applicant began 
working part time as a clerk in a retail establishment to supplement his income. (Tr. 25) 
He received about $250 monthly from his part-time employment. (Tr. 26) His monthly 
rent is $1,150, and he recently began receiving $300 monthly from a roommate. (Tr. 26) 
In 2015, he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, and his monthly medications cost 
about $125. (Tr. 48) He estimated he had about $1,800 remaining at the end of the 
month to address his debts. (AE P at 4) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
 Applicant provided 11 character statements from friends, colleagues, and 
supervisors, some of whom have known Applicant for almost 20 years and many served 
with him in the most elite aviation unit in the Army. (AE S-Y, AA-AD) The statements 
laud Applicant’s duty performance, leadership, trustworthiness, integrity, and important 
contributions to the national defense. The 11 statements support continuation of his 
security clearance. 
 
Applicant has received the following awards: Army Commendation Medal 
(ARCOM); five Army Achievement Medals (AAM); Joint Service Achievement Medal 
(JSAM); Joint Meritorious Unit Award (JMUA); Army Superior Unit Award (ASUA); Army 
Good Conduct Medal (3rd Award); National Defense Service Medal (NDSM); Armed 
Forces Expeditionary Medal (AFEM); Southwest Asia Service Medal with Bronze 
Service Star (SWASM w/ BSS); Noncommissioned Officer Professional Development 
Ribbon (NCOPDR); Army Service Ribbon (ASR); Overseas Service Ribbon (OSR); 
Senior Aviation Badge; and various other badges. (AE C)  
      
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
 
6 
                                         
 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this 
decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;” and “(g) failure to file annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the  
same.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, SF 86, 
SOR response, and hearing record. Applicant’s SOR alleges, and the evidence 
establishes Applicant had 22 delinquent debts totaling $6,897. He also failed to timely 
file his state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2005 through 2009. Failure to 
file tax returns may be a federal criminal offense as such conduct can violate 26 U.S.C. 
§ 7203.3 The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), 
and 19(g) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
                                            
3 26 U.S.C. § 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, provides:  
 
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this 
title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or 
supply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such 
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by 
law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a 
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 
($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, 
together with the costs of prosecution.

downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;4 and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a) through 20(d) apply to the non-tax delinquent debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 
1.i-1.p, and 1.r-1.aa. AG ¶ 20(e) applies to the debts he disputed in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.h, 
and 1.q. Applicant’s SOR lists 22 delinquent debts totaling $6,897. He paid 11 debts, 1 
                                            
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

He assured he intends to pay the unresolved debts and the disputed debts, should the 
creditors continue to seek payment from him. He admitted he made some poor financial 
decisions. Applicant made excellent progress bringing his non-tax delinquent debts to 
current or paid status. 
 
Separation and divorce, disputes over the deduction for his son on his federal 
income tax returns, depression, anxiety, and diabetes are all circumstances beyond 
Applicant’s control which adversely affected his finances. Applicant was able to continue 
his employment as an aircraft mechanic and these issues do not excuse his failure to 
timely file and pay his federal and state income taxes.    
 
Applicant’s failure to timely file his tax returns and pay his taxes raises the most 
significant security concern. For tax years 2006 to 2009, the IRS filed his tax returns for 
Applicant on April 8, 2013. All of his tax returns are now filed. He currently owes the IRS 
about $11,000. He has a payment plan to resolve his $11,000 federal tax debt. 
Applicant indicated he had a remainder of $1,800 each month, and he did not explain 
why he was only paying the IRS $100 a month to address his tax debts. The material he 
provided from the state tax authority was for tax year 2012, and it was inadequate to 
address the possibility that he owed state taxes for tax years 2005 to 2009. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old aircraft mechanic employed by a defense contractor, 
who is seeking to continue his security clearance. He served on active duty in the Army 
from 1990 to 2001 and in the National Guard from 2001 to 2012. He received an 
 
10 
                                         
 
honorable discharge, and he has qualified for retirement benefits when he is age 60. In 
1993, he married, and in 2008, he divorced.  
 
Applicant provided 11 character statements from friends, colleagues, and 
supervisors, some of whom have known Applicant for almost 20 years and many served 
with him in the most elite aviation unit in the Army. The statements laud Applicant’s duty 
performance, leadership, trustworthiness, integrity, important contributions to the 
national defense, and support continuation of his security clearance. Applicant has 
received the following awards: ARCOM; five AAMs; JSAM; JMUA; ASUA; Army Good 
Conduct Medal (3rd Award); NDSM; AFEM; SWASM w/ BSS; NCOPDR; ASR; OSR; 
Senior Aviation Badge; and various other badges.  
 
Applicant admitted responsibility for 22 delinquent debts totaling $6,897. He paid 
11 debts, 1 debt is in a payment plan, 3 debts are disputed, and 7 debts are unresolved. 
His overall efforts on non-tax debt resolution are sufficient to mitigate all of his non-tax 
SOR debts. Applicant’s separation and divorce, disputes over who should take the tax 
deduction for his son, depression, stress, and diabetes are circumstances beyond his 
control that contributed to his adverse financial situation. 
 
Applicant failed to timely file and pay his federal and state income taxes from 
2005 through 2009. The IRS filed his federal income tax returns for tax years 2006 
through 2009 in 2013, and he has been making payments on his delinquent taxes. 
However, his history of failing to timely file and pay his federal and state income taxes 
raises unresolved financial considerations security concerns. He owes about $11,000 to 
the IRS, and he is only paying $100 a month to the IRS when his personal financial 
statement indicates he has about $1,800 available monthly to address his tax debt.5 He 
did not provide sufficient documentation from the state tax authority to establish his 
state tax returns are filed and state taxes paid. When an issue of delinquent taxes is 
involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how long an applicant waits to 
file their tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax returns, and how long the 
applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete making payments.6

clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A security clearance represents 
an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor 
other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and 
ability to protect classified information.”).

clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant’s control 
adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant’s wages, 
and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and insufficient 
discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. 
Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited 
applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns for 
tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except for 
$13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income of 
over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical 
problems. The Appeal Board emphasized the “the allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the

 I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.f through 1.aa:  For Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant or reinstate Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
