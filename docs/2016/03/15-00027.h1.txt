HESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations).  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on July 28, 2014. 
On August 4, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 
2006.  
  
 Applicant received the SOR and answered it on August 31, 2015, requesting a 
decision on the record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the 
Government’s written case on September 24, 2015, and a complete copy of the file of 
relevant material (FORM,) which included Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5, was 
sent to Applicant the same day. He was given an opportunity to file objections and 
 
  2
submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s evidence. He 
received the FORM on October 7, 2015, and did not respond.1 The case was assigned 
to me on February 23, 2016.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
The SOR alleges four delinquent debts totaling approximately $42,984, which 
include a $31,315 federal tax lien (SOR ¶ 1.a) and a $10,278 delinquent line of credit 
(SOR ¶ 1.b). In his Answer, Applicant admitted these two debts, but qualified both 
admissions with the repayment status of each debt. He denied owing the debt of $1,181 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c, stating that he was the victim of identity theft.  He denied the $210 
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d, stating he paid it.   Applicant’s admissions are incorporated 
in my findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 41-year-old database administrator employed by a defense 
contractor since September 2005. He graduated from high school in June 1992 and 
served honorably on active duty in the U.S. Army from August 1992 until August 2005. 
He was granted a security clearance by the U.S. Army in 1993 and has held a DOD 
security clearance since 2005. (GX 5.) 
 
 Applicant married in March 2000 and divorced in 2002. Although he owns a 
home in the U.S., he has been living and working overseas since 2005, primarily 
supporting U.S. military missions. He was unemployed for three months in 2010 while 
between jobs, and lived off his savings during this period. (GX 2; GX 3.) 
 
The tax lien and delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant’s credit bureau 
reports (CBRs) dated August 2014 and June 2015. (GX 4; GX 5.)  Applicant disclosed 
and explained the repayment status of the tax lien, including a prior garnishment, in his 
Personal Subject Interview (GX 3.)   
 
 Shortly after Applicant began working overseas in 2005, he was advised by a 
fellow contractor that he was not required to file tax returns until he returned to the U.S. 
(GX 3.) Applicant relied on this misinformation, and failed to timely file and pay his 
federal taxes from 2006 until 2011.  He remained unaware of the erroneousness of this 
advice until approximately June 2012, when the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began 
garnishing his wages. (GX 3.) The IRS also placed a lien against Applicant’s house in 
2012, in the approximate amount of $31,314. He contacted an attorney to assist him in 
setting up a payment plan, but in the interim, the IRS continued to garnish his wages. 
(GX 3; GX 5.) In November 2014, he entered a direct debit payment plan with the IRS of 
$800 per month. He has filed and paid his taxes since 2011 and is current with this 
repayment plan. (GX 1.) 
 
                                                            
1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated September 24, 2015, and Applicant’s 
receipt is dated October 7, 2015. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after receiving 
it to submit information.  The DOHA transmittal letter and receipt are marked as Administrative Exhibit 1.

 The $10,278 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b is for a line of credit that was placed for 
collection in 2011. Applicant had been making payments as agreed until the creditor 
entered bankruptcy.  He discontinued his payments because he did not know where to 
send them.  Later, while reviewing his credit report, he was able to identify a collection 
creditor. In August 2014, he entered a repayment plan, with scheduled monthly 
payments of $416. (GX 3; GX 1.) He pays this account as agreed and the August 2015 
balance was approximately $8,584, making the current balance approximately $6,088. 
(GX 1.)   
 
 Applicant denies that he owes the $1,181 credit card debt as alleged in SOR ¶ 
1.c. He states that he realized he was a victim of identity theft in 2011, when he 
returned to his home in the U.S. and discovered that the prior tenants had damaged his 
residence, failed to pay the utility bills, opened a credit-card account in his name, and 
illegally sold his personal property.  He filed a local police report, and has provided the 
investigative case number assigned by the police. He has also disputed this account 
with the credit reporting agencies. (GX 3; GX 1.) This debt does not appear on the June 
2015 CBR. (GX 5.) The unpaid utility bills had been placed for collection, and Applicant 
paid them. (GX 4.) 
 
The $210 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d was placed for collection in 2009.  Applicant 
did not recognize this account during his September 2014 PSI, but stated that he would 
contact the creditor. (GX 3.) Applicant now states that he paid the debt “some months” 
prior to receiving the SOR. (GX 1.) This debt does not appear on the June 2015 CBR. 
(GX 5.) He has not incurred any delinquent debt since 2011.2 (GX 4; GX 3.) 
    
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant’s meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
                                                            
2 The tax lien was entered in 2012 for tax years 2006-2011.

 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
 
  5
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
  
 Applicant’s admissions, corroborated by his CBRs, e-QIP, and PSI, establish two 
disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts”) and AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”). The 
following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is established. The circumstances surrounding Applicant’s financial 
issues are unlikely to recur and Applicant’s behavior does not cast doubt on his “current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” He relied on the erroneous tax advice of a 
coworker, and, upon learning of his mistake, took action to rectify it. The creditor for his 
line of credit entered bankruptcy.  He tracked down the new creditor and entered into a 
payment plan. He was a victim of identity theft. He reported the crime and disputed the 
fraudulent account.  
  
 
  6
 AG ¶ 20(b) is partially established. Clearly, Applicant had no control over his 
creditor entering bankruptcy or being a victim of identity theft. He acted responsibly 
under both these circumstances.  While his reliance on the erroneous tax advice of a 
coworker was arguably within his control, upon learning of his mistake, he acted 
responsibly by arranging a repayment plan with the IRS.    
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is established. Applicant has not received financial counseling; 
however, he has resolved or is resolving his debts and there is a “clear indication” that 
his financial problems are under control. He has not incurred any delinquent debt since 
2011. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is established. Of the four debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant has 
paid one and successfully disputed another.  He has been in repayment of his tax debt 
since 2012, first through garnishment and, since November 2014, through a direct debit 
monthly payment of $800. The fact that Applicant was paying this debt through 
garnishment rather than a voluntary effort diminishes its mitigating force. ISCR Case 
No. 08-06058 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug.26, 2010). However, payment by garnishment does 
not bar mitigation of financial concerns. ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep 
26, 2006). He has been paying $416 monthly on his $10,278 line of credit and the 
current balance is about $6,000. “Good faith” means acting in a way that shows 
reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case 
No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A security clearance 
adjudication is an evaluation of an individual’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. 
It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) 
A person is not required to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or 
she need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions 
to implement the plan. The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual 
make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor do they require that the 
debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. 
May 21, 2008). 
 
AG ¶ 20(e) is established.  Applicant disputed the debt from the stolen credit-
card account with the police and the credit-reporting agencies.  He provided the police’s 
investigative case number and the debt does not appear on the August 2014 CBR. (GX 
3; GX 5.)  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
 
  7
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but I 
have also considered the following: 
 
 Applicant served honorably in the U.S. Army for 13 years, where he was first 
granted a security clearance in 1993. He has worked overseas supporting U.S. military 
missions and held a DOD security clearance since 2005. During his brief period of 
unemployment in 2010, he lived off his savings and did not incur any delinquent debt.  
He lives within his means and is current on all his ongoing financial obligations. I am 
confident that Applicant will continue his good-faith efforts to resolve his remaining 
delinquent debts. 
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has  
mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. Accordingly, I conclude 
he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a – 1.d:    For Applicant. 
   
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted.
