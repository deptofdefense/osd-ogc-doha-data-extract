GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 23, 2012, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On an unspecified date, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued him a set of interrogatories. He 
responded to the interrogatories on July 22, 2013.2 On April 17, 2015, he submitted 
another e-QIP.3 On September 28, 2015, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6,

Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR, as there is no receipt in the case 
file. In a sworn statement, dated October 10, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a 
hearing.4 A complete copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was 
provided to Applicant on December 7, 2015, and he was afforded an opportunity, within 
a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in 
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished 
a copy of the Directive as well as the Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant 
received the FORM on December 11, 2015. A response was due by January 10, 2016. 
As of March 1, 2016, Applicant had not submitted any response to the FORM. The case 
was assigned to me on March 15, 2016.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, while not specifically using the terms “admit” or “deny,” 
Applicant acknowledged and addressed the factual allegations pertaining to financial 
considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c.). Applicant’s admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as a security officer with his current employer since June 2011.5 He also held a 
number of different positions, including that of deputy sheriff, with other employers over 
the years. A June 1979 high school graduate, Applicant earned some college credits, 
but did not earn a degree.6 He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in June 1979 and 
served honorably until he was discharged in June 1983.7 In March 1987, he enlisted in 
the Army National Guard and served honorably until he was discharged in March 1993.8

Applicant has held a secret security clearance since March 2012.9 Applicant was 
married in May 1990.10 He has two daughters, born in 1986 and 1994.11 
 
Financial Considerations12 
 
It is unclear when Applicant first began to experience significant financial 
difficulties. He and his wife were a middle class, two-income family, living day-to-day, 
caring for the family and meeting their obligations. In January 2012, he reported that his 
wife had previously been recruited by a headhunter for a position with a federal 
contractor. Six months after taking the job, she was laid off. As a result of the layoff, she 
was unemployed for one and one-half years. The family’s two incomes diminished to 
one income, and finances became tight. A variety of accounts, including real estate 
mortgages, automobile loans, credit cards, and student loans, became delinquent. In an 
effort to preserve their home, in January 2010, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The following year, Applicant’s wife returned 
to work making a salary that was substantially more than she had previously made. 
With increased financial stability, he chose to cancel the bankruptcy action and, instead, 
decided to handle his debts conventionally.  
 
The SOR identified three purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, totaling 
approximately $142,648, which had been placed for collection. Those debts and their 
respective current status, according to the above-cited credit reports, Applicant’s 
comments to an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), 
and his answers to both the interrogatories and the SOR, are described as follows: 
 SOR ¶ 1.a. – This is a student loan account that appears to be a combination of 
student loans for both Applicant and his wife. The loans went into a default status and 
were transferred or sold to various servicing agencies or other lenders before being 
acquired by the current lender. They were consolidated and placed into a forbearance 
status in August 2012 due to temporary hardship, and from August 2013 until July 2014 
due to loan debt burden.13 Applicant defaulted on his student loans because he was not 
allowed to make monthly payments while the bankruptcy was active.14 Although the

April 2015 credit report reflects one loan with a high credit of $75,881, an unpaid 
balance of $125,180, and a past-due balance of $2,974, a more recent report of the 
loan details indicates the account was placed into a temporary hardship forbearance on 
March 30, 2015, and that status will continue until November 30, 2015. While there is 
unpaid interest, there are no late fees.15 Applicant failed to submit documentation 
reflecting that the agreed monthly payments of $212.53 were made upon the 
termination of the forbearance. 
 SOR ¶ 1.b. – This is a credit card with an unpaid, past-due balance of $2,085 
that was sold to a debt purchaser who increased the unpaid balance to $2,470.16 
Applicant contended that he and the creditor had agreed to a repayment plan and that 
he was making monthly payments of $130 to $150 under the plan.17 While he did submit 
a homepage download of the creditor’s debt management program,18 he failed to submit 
documentation reflecting either the plan or that the agreed monthly payments were 
being made. 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c. and 1.d. – This is a federal tax lien in the amount of $15,383.19 that 
was filed against Applicant and his wife on April 20, 2013.19 Applicant allegedly owed an 
unspecified amount of federal income tax for the tax years 1999, 2000, 2004, 2005, 
2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Evidence of Applicant’s purported income tax liability for 
the various tax years is incomplete and confusing, for it relies solely on submissions 
from Applicant and the OPM report of investigation failed to address the issue. There is 
no evidence that Applicant owes the IRS any money for the tax years 1999, 2000, 2004, 
2005, 2008, or 2012. For the tax year 2009, Applicant should have paid $9,011, but he 
only had $8,701 withheld. He was credited with an $800 payment, but that meant there 
was an overpayment by him of $490, and that overpayment was credited to another tax 
year.20 For the tax year 2010, Applicant should have paid $8,419, but he had $10,033 
withheld. A refund of $2,414 was issued to him. However, a 2013 review of his income 
for the year resulted in an assessment of additional taxes and interest.21 For the tax 
year 2011, Applicant should have paid $21,766, and he had only $17,819 withheld. He 
paid $100 with his income tax return, leaving an unpaid tax of $3,847. He was 
subsequently assessed penalty for late payment of tax and interest on the late 
payment.22

On December 19, 2012, the IRS issued a Notice of Intent to Levy, but as of 
January 7, 2013, the notice had still been unclaimed.23 As noted above, the federal tax 
lien was filed in April 2013. On June 26, 2013, Applicant submitted a request to the IRS 
seeking a direct debit installment agreement, and in August 2013, that request was 
finally approved. Under the installment agreement, the IRS was authorized to deduct up 
to $900 from Applicant’s checking account on the 28th of each month.24 Applicant 
contends the monthly payments were made from September 28, 2013 through 
December 2014.  
The subsequent scenario offered by Applicant is confusing. He claimed that on 
December 5, 2014, he requested by phone that the payment dates be moved from the 
15th of each month to the 25th of each month because his wife’s payroll cycle had 
changed.25 It is unclear why such a move was necessary because the payment date 
according to the IRS was already the 28th of each month. The IRS customer service 
agent approved the change, and Applicant was advised that no payment was due for 
January 2015, with the next payment scheduled for February 25, 2015. The IRS 
scenario differed, and it stated that Applicant had contacted the IRS on January 5, 
2015, not December 5, 2014.26 Unfortunately there was still a disconnection, and the 
IRS repeatedly submitted debit attempts in January 2015 causing, what Applicant 
claims, were over $350 in overdraft fees.27 On February 12, 2015, he submitted a claim 
for reimbursement of bank charges.28 The IRS agreed that there was an error on its part 
and agreed to support a partial reimbursement of bank charges.29 The installment 
agreement was apparently cancelled when the January 2015 payment was not made. 
Applicant sought to have it reinstated, and apparently was successful, for he resumed 
making payments to the IRS. An $800 payment was debited from his new bank account 
on September 25, 2015.30 
While Applicant did not submit a current Personal Financial Statement reflecting 
his net monthly income, his estimated monthly expenses, his total debt payments, or 
any monthly remainder available for discretionary spending or savings, he did submit 
two Statements of Earnings for two pay periods in 2013. His net earnings for the period 
January 1, 2013 through June 1, 2013, were $26,779.99.31

There is no evidence that Applicant ever received financial counseling. While the 
documentary evidence is sketchy, it appears that Applicant was in the process of 
resolving his delinquent accounts well before the SOR was issued. Applicant’s financial 
problems are under control and his financial status has improved significantly. 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”32 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”33   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”34 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation,

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.35  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”36 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”37 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.

8 
                                      
 
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s significant financial problems arose in 2010 when he had 
insufficient money to maintain all of his monthly payments. He was apparently forced to 
prioritize his bills, and various accounts became delinquent. Some of those accounts, 
both SOR and non-SOR, were placed for collection. Student loans went into default. A 
federal income tax lien was filed. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”38  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) partially apply. The nature, frequency, and 
recency of Applicant’s somewhat isolated financial difficulties since about 2010 facilitate 
the conclusions that those financial issues were rather infrequent, and that they 
occurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur. Applicant’s financial 
problems were not caused by his frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not 
spend beyond his means. Instead, those financial problems were largely beyond his 
control. Applicant described his situation as a middle class, two-income family, living 
day-to-day, caring for the family and meeting their obligations. Things changed when, 
six months after accepting a new position, Applicant’s wife was laid off from her job. She 
remained unemployed for one and one-half years. When the family’s two incomes 
diminished to one income, finances became tight, and a variety of accounts became 
delinquent. In an effort to preserve their home, in January 2010, Applicant filed for 
bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The following year, 
                                                          
38
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

Applicant’s wife returned to work making a salary that was substantially more than she 
had previously made. Applicant cancelled the bankruptcy action and, instead, decided 
to handle his debts conventionally. The significance of the unproven allegations of 
unpaid income taxes for the tax years 1999, 2000, 2004, 2005, 2008, and 2012 is 
unexplained.  
 
Applicant never shied away from his fiscal responsibilities. He did not ignore his 
creditors. Instead, he initiated a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors and set 
upon a course to resolve his debts. He resolved a number of the non-SOR accounts 
and entered into repayment plans well before the SOR was issued. Applicant was 
unable to make payments on the student loans while his Chapter 13 bankruptcy was 
still active, and they fell into default. Eventually, his and his wife’s student loans were 
consolidated and salvaged from the default status. They were placed into a forbearance 
status in August 2012, and they remained in that status until November 30, 2015. In 
other words, they were not delinquent when several of the credit reports or the SOR 
were issued. Although Applicant agreed to make monthly payments of $212.53 upon 
the termination of the forbearance, he failed to submit any documentation, other than 
his handwritten notes, to support his claim.  
 
The federal income tax lien in the amount of $15,383 involved insufficient income 
taxes withheld or paid during tax years 2010 and 2011, the period of Applicant’s most 
significant financial difficulties. Applicant had received a refund for the tax year 2009. He 
also initially received a rather large refund for the tax year 2010, but a subsequent 
reassessment recalculated his tax liability. He had insufficient taxes withheld for the tax 
year 2011. In June 2013 – nearly two and one-half years before the SOR was issued – 
Applicant sought a direct debit installment agreement with the IRS. Such an agreement 
was finally instituted in August 2013, and routine monthly payments were made. Things 
were messed up through miscommunication and erroneous advice received from the 
IRS, and the installment agreement was modified and reinstituted. In fact, Applicant 
made an $800 payment three days before the SOR was issued. 
 
Applicant’s remaining delinquent account is also being addressed. He contends 
he has a repayment plan and is making payments under that plan. Unfortunately, he 
failed to submit documentation reflecting either the existence of the plan or that agreed 
payments have been made. He has no other delinquent accounts. Applicant’s financial 
problems are under control and his financial status has improved significantly. While 
Applicant may not have enjoyed the benefit of financial counseling, he appears to have 
acted prudently and responsibly. Applicant’s actions, under the circumstances 
confronting him, no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.39 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s

conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.40   
     
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant failed 
to make his monthly payments on a variety of accounts, and they became delinquent. In 
January 2010, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code. He later cancelled the bankruptcy. His student loans fell into default status. 
Because Applicant failed to timely pay his federal income taxes, in April 2013, the IRS 
filed a tax lien, in the amount of $15,383.19, against Applicant. 
 
The mitigating evidence is more substantial and compelling. Applicant served 
honorably with both the U.S. Marine Corps and the Army National Guard. He has held a 
secret security clearance since March 2012. He has been serving as a security officer 
with his current employer since June 2011. He was formerly a deputy sheriff. There is 
no evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling protected 
information, substance abuse, or criminal conduct. Applicant’s financial problems were 
not caused by his frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his 
means. Rather, they were largely beyond his control. Applicant’s student loans were 
eventually retrieved from default and went into forbearance. He had and still has a direct 
debit installment agreement with the IRS. He has a repayment agreement with his 
remaining delinquent account. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial 
problems are being resolved and are under control. He resolved a number of accounts 
and entered into repayment plans well before the SOR was issued.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of

Bd. June 2, 2006).

actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 41 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts, and he started to do so years before the SOR was issued. 
Nevertheless, because Applicant is currently in the process of resolving his student loan 
accounts and his federal income tax lien, this decision should serve as a warning that 
Applicant’s failure to continue his debt resolution efforts pertaining to those remaining 
accounts, or the actual accrual of new delinquent debts, will adversely affect his future 
eligibility for a security clearance.42  
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. 
See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant as security officials may continue to monitor his 
finances, this decision, including the warning, should not be interpreted as a conditional eligibility to hold a security 
clearance. The Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit reports, 
investigation, and interrogatories. Approval of a security clearance now does not bar the Government from 
subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the security significance of past 
conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative security significance.” Nevertheless, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach limiting conditions, such as an interim, 
conditional, or probationary status, to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 
(App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 
06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006); ISCR Case No. 04-

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
