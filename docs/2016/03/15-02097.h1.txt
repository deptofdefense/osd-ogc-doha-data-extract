GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 3, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On September 17, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial

Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on October 2, 2015. On October 10, 2015, Applicant 
responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative 
judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on 
December 30, 2015. However, on January 13, 2016, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued an amendment to the SOR to him. It is unclear when 
Applicant received the amended SOR as there is no receipt in the case file. On January 
23, 2016, Applicant responded to the amended SOR allegations. The case was 
assigned to me on January 15, 2016. A Notice of Hearing was issued on January 20, 
2016, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 1, 2016.2 
 
 During the hearing, 4 Government exhibits (GE A through D) and 24 Applicant 
exhibits (AE 2, 3, 10, and 16 through 36)3 were admitted into evidence without 
objection. Applicant chose to withdraw 12 numbered exhibits that had been marked for 
identification and attached to the Answer to the SOR (AE 1, and 4 through 15), but AE 
14 was subsequently resubmitted and admitted into evidence without objection.4 One 
Administrative Exhibit was also admitted. Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was 
received on February 9, 2016. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement 
it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity. He timely submitted a number of 
documents, which were marked as AE 37 through AE 43, and admitted into evidence 
without objection. The record closed on February 22, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answers to the SOR and the amended SOR, Applicant admitted one (¶ 
1.b.) and a portion of another (¶ 1.c.) of the factual allegations pertaining to financial 
considerations. He denied the remaining allegations or a portion thereof. Applicant’s

 Although the Notice of Hearing was administratively requested on January 15, 2016, it was not issued until 
12 days before the scheduled date for the hearing. Applicant’s attorney and Department Counsel previously had 
telephone discussions regarding the general time and location of the hearing. Nevertheless, on January 20, 2016, 
Applicant’s attorney objected and chose not to waive the required notice period. During a subsequent three-party 
conference call, Applicant’s attorney withdrew her objection. No objection was interposed during the hearing.

 Under normal circumstances, it is my practice to mark the Government’s exhibits by number and the 
Applicant’s exhibits by letter. However, in this instance, Applicant’s attorney had already pre-marked his exhibits with 
numbers, and to avoid confusion, I simply reversed my practice.

 Tr. at 20-23. I notified the parties that the proposed exhibits that were previously attached to the Answer to 
the SOR were being returned to Applicant’s attorney so that she could offer them as evidentiary exhibits rather than 
as attachments to the Answer. When Applicant’s attorney chose not to reintroduce some of those documents, for 
reasons not fully explained, Department Counsel initially objected to them being included as part of the Answer, 
subsequently requested that they be returned to Applicant and not be part of the record, and eventually objected to 
the documents being returned, because Department Counsel sought to examine Applicant regarding the content of 
the documents. My rule remained undisturbed and the documents that Applicant chose to withdraw were retained by 
me as non-evidentiary associated documents. Nevertheless, Department Counsel did use some of the documents 
during the course of her examination of Applicant. See Tr. at 60-62, 84-85.

answers are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is a master 
scheduler, having started out as a sheet metal technician, with his current employer 
since April 1988.5 Applicant received a General Educational Development (GED) 
diploma in 1978.6 Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in December 1980, and 
served until March 1988, when he was honorably discharged as a staff sergeant (E-5).7 
During his military service, Applicant was awarded the Air Force Training Ribbon, the 
Air Force Longevity Service Award Ribbon, and the Air Force Good Conduct Medal 
(with one bronze oak leaf cluster).8 
 
It is unclear if Applicant ever held a security clearance. However, when he was in 
the U.S. Air Force, Applicant was in the Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) - a U.S. 
DOD security, medical and psychological evaluation program - designed to permit only 
the most trustworthy individuals to have access to nuclear weapons.9 Applicant was 
married in December 1981 and divorced in May 2003.10 He has been residing with a 
cohabitant since September 2008 or October 2010.11 He has two daughters, born in 
1982 and 1985.12 
 
Financial Considerations 
It is unclear when Applicant first started having issues with his finances, but he 
referred to several factors which contributed to his eventual financial problems over the 
years: (1) his excessive consumption of alcohol; (2) his addiction to prescribed pain-
killing medications; (3) migraine headaches and two separate surgeries; (4) a corporate 
restructuring which resulted in a downgrade of his position with a $14,000 per year 
salary loss; (5) poor judgment; and (6) his life was in turmoil. Associated with one of 
more of those primary factors were his 1986 conviction for driving while intoxicated 
(DWI); his 2003 divorce and associated alimony and child support costs; his 2007 
conviction for breach of the peace; and his 2007 detoxification and 90-day outpatient 
substance abuse program. As a result of the above combination of factors and

incidents, Applicant conceded that while his personal and professional lives were being 
destroyed, his financial situation became overburdened.13 
Applicant’s income tax return for the tax year 2003 was received by the IRS on 
April 15, 2004, and because he had too much withheld, on May 24, 2004, a refund was 
issued to him in the amount of $1,352.47.14 Applicant’s initial lack of sobriety and the 
various other factors, including insufficient funds and procrastination, generally led him 
to fail to timely file his federal income tax returns for 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007. He 
claimed he was not aware that he could have filed his income tax returns even if he did 
not have sufficient funds to pay his income taxes.15 The IRS filed substitute returns on 
his behalf for those years.16 Although Applicant had addressed his alcohol and pain-
killer medication problems in September 2007 by turning to his employer for assistance; 
taking a leave of absence for ten days for inpatient detoxification; 90 days of outpatient 
care; and entering a 12-step program with Narcotics Anonymous (NA), his life was in 
turmoil. Nevertheless, he was able to prioritize his responsibilities and actions. They 
were (a) break the bonds of addiction, and (b) retain his employment to be able to 
address his various financial obligations. It took some time to do so, but an action by the 
IRS – an organization that intimidated him – brought the severity of the problem to the 
forefront.17  
On June 3, 2010, the IRS filed a federal tax lien on Applicant alleging the unpaid 
balance of assessments were as follows: $14,612.02 for 2004; $13,065.42 for 2005; 
and $13,709.07 for 2006, for a combined unpaid balance of $41,486.51.18 On August 
10, 2010, the IRS filed another federal tax lien on Applicant alleging the unpaid balance 
of assessments for 2007 was $12,938.62.19  
In July 2010, Applicant decided to address his “financial mess” and sought the 
assistance of some professional accountants and tax resolution specialists to complete 
income tax returns for the tax years 2008 and 2009, as well as to place him in a position 
to negotiate a repayment plan and establish an installment agreement for the tax years

2004 through 2009.20 Applicant became disenchanted with those services because they 
made errors in the tax returns they prepared, and they were never available to answer 
his telephone calls.21 Applicant’s income tax returns for the tax years 2008 and 2009 
were filed late on July 23, 2010.22 Applicant’s income tax returns for the ensuing years 
have all been timely filed.23 
Applicant entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in mid-2010, and 
from August 2010 through September 2013, using a web-based third-party provider of 
electronic payments to federal and state agencies, he made 38 payments of $600 each. 
In October 2013, he made a $700 payment. Commencing in November 2013, he has 
made monthly payments of $1,045 each.24 On March 11, 2015 – six months before the 
SOR was issued – the IRS issued a Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien which 
satisfied the lien for $41,386.51 (SOR ¶ 1.a.).25 On November 4, 2015 – nearly three 
months before the hearing was held – the IRS issued a Certificate of Release of Federal 
Tax Lien which satisfied the lien for $12,938.62 (SOR ¶ 1.b.).26 With the exception of 
the two tax liens that have been resolved, and one other collection account that was 
previously settled and resolved, Applicant’s most recent credit report does not reflect 
any delinquent accounts.27 It appears that his financial problems, including those with 
the IRS, are finally under control.  
 Applicant has been abstinent from alcohol since July 4, 2006, and from pain-killer 
medications since September 2007. He remains an active participant in the NA 
program, where he underwent a tremendous amount of soul searching and 
introspective thinking, and has completed the 12-step program for the second time. He 
has a sponsor. Although he attended NA meetings on a daily basis for a number of 
years, for the past six years he has been attending meetings two days each week. He

correctly recited the Serenity Prayer. He has a variety of sobriety coins, including an 8-
year coin attesting to his continued sobriety over the years.28 
 
Work Performance and Character References 
 Applicant’s annual work performance ratings since 2003 have been 
predominately “successful contributor” and “high contributor,” but he has, on occasion, 
also been “exceeded” and “significantly exceeded.”29 His most recent performance 
appraisal rated him as “significantly exceeded” or 4.9 out of a possible 5.0.30 His annual 
salary since joining his employer started at $79,688, dropped by 15.94% in 2004, 
subsequently exceeded his original starting salary in 2013, and, as of February 2015, 
he now earns $98,835.31 He has also received a number of spot awards, excellence 
awards, long-term incentive awards, and a team accomplishment award.32 It was also 
noted that Applicant “has demonstrated superior judgment on all levels regarding the 
interests of [the employer] and ultimately the best interests for our customers.”33 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”34 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”35   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information.

An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”36 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.37  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”38 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”39 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to

2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. In addition, a “failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax 
returns as required. . .” may raise security concerns under AG ¶ 19(g). Applicant failed 
to timely file his federal income tax returns for 2004 through 2009. In 2010, two federal 
tax liens were filed on Applicant alleging the unpaid balances of his assessments for 
those years as $41,486.51 and $12,938.62. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”40  
                                                          
40
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person

AG ¶ 20(d) applies.  AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), and 20(c) partially apply. Applicant’s 
financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did 
not spend beyond his means. To his credit, he acknowledged having made some poor 
decisions pertaining to alcohol and pain-killer medications, and he admitted a lack of 
sobriety, addiction to pain-killer medications, poor judgment, and procrastination. The 
nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s financial difficulties make it difficult to 
conclude that it “was so infrequent.” Instead, as noted above, Applicant’s financial 
problems consisted of two components: failing to timely file his federal income tax 
returns over a span of years, and failing to timely pay the federal income taxes for the 
same tax years. His finances were stretched and his thinking was affected by: (1) his 
excessive consumption of alcohol; (2) his addiction to prescribed pain-killing 
medications; (3) migraine headaches and two separate surgeries; and (4) a corporate 
restructuring which resulted in a downgrade of his position with a $14,000 per year 
salary loss. His decision-making was negatively impacted by the alcohol and the pain-
killer medications. Years passed without filing federal income tax returns. He was 
intimidated by the IRS and failed to see the severity of the situation. 
However, eventual sobriety from alcohol and abstinence from pain-killer 
medications, a newly developed strength, along with the realization of the seriousness 
of the problem, resulted in Applicant’s decision to extricate himself from his “financial 
mess.” He engaged the professional services of some accountants and tax resolution 
specialists and addressed the IRS directly. His federal income tax returns for the tax 
years 2004 through 2009 were filed. His income tax return for the tax year 2003 was 
actually filed on time. Applicant entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in 
mid-2010 – over five years before the initial SOR was issued. Monthly payments were 
routinely made. On March 11, 2015 – six months before the SOR was issued – the IRS 
issued a Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien which satisfied the lien for 
$41,386.51. On November 4, 2015 – nearly three months before the hearing was held – 
the IRS issued a Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien which satisfied the lien for 
$12,938.62. Applicant has resolved all of the allegations in the SOR and the amended 
SOR as well as accounts that were not in the SOR. There are clear indications that 
Applicant’s financial problems are under control. His actions, under the circumstances, 
no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.41 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating 
condition].

conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.42       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant failed to 
fully appreciate the requirements to timely file his federal income tax returns for the tax 
years 2004 through 2009, or to make timely payments, or enter into installment 
agreements with the IRS pertaining to the repayment of unpaid taxes. Because of his 
double failures, the IRS filed substitute income tax returns for him for 2004 through 
2007, and two federal tax liens were filed against him in 2010. In addition, he abused 
alcohol until 2006 and pain-killer medications until 2007. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant served with the U.S. Air Force from December 1980 until March 1988, when 
he was honorably discharged as a staff sergeant (E-5). During his military service, 
Applicant was in the Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) - a U.S. DOD security, 
medical and psychological evaluation program - designed to permit only the most 
trustworthy individuals to have access to nuclear weapons. Applicant overcame a litany 
of mishaps and substance-related problems. He sought employer assistance for an 
inpatient detoxification program and a 90-day outpatient program. He followed those 
programs with years of active involvement with NA. He embraced sobriety. He faced his 
fears and addressed his financial mess. Income tax returns were filed, an installment 
agreement was agreed to, and payments were made. Income tax returns for the tax 
years 2010 and the ensuing years have all been filed timely. The tax liens were 
released. Applicant did not wait for an SOR to motivate his actions. He had already 
resolved one tax lien, the larger of the two, well before the SOR was issued. Applicant 
has an outstanding reputation in the workplace. There are clear indications that 
Applicant’s financial problems are under control. His actions under the circumstances 
no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.

The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 43 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts, and he started to do so years before the SOR was issued. This 
decision should serve as a warning that Applicant’s failure to continue the timely filing of 
annual federal income tax returns, will adversely affect his future eligibility for a security 
clearance.44 
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. 
See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant as security officials may continue to monitor his 
finances, this decision, including the warning, should not be interpreted as a conditional eligibility to hold a security 
clearance. The Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit reports, 
investigation, and interrogatories. Approval of a security clearance now does not bar the Government from 
subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the security significance of past 
conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative security significance.” Nevertheless, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach limiting conditions, such as an interim, 
conditional, or probationary status, to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 
(App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 
06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006); ISCR Case No. 04-
04302 at 5 (App. Bd. June 30, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-17410 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-
0109 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000).

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR 
and amended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
