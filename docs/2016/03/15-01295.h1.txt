HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
On August 26, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial 
Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) effective within the Department of Defense after September 1, 2006.  
  
 On September 19, 2015, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a decision 
on the record. Department Counsel issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on  
October 27, 2015. Applicant received the FORM on November 10, 2015.  Applicant had 
30 days to submit a response to the FORM. He did not submit a response to the FORM. 
On February 1, 2015, the FORM was forwarded to the Hearing Office and assigned to 
me on March 1, 2016. Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, 
eligibility for access to classified information is denied.

Rulings on Evidence  
 
 Item 3 of the FORM is a portion of the Report of Investigation (ROI) from the 
background investigation of Applicant. It is a summary of Applicant’s Personal Subject 
Interview completed by the investigator conducting his background investigation on 
September 19, 2012, and October 22, 2012. It is unsworn and unauthenticated. DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.20 states, “An ROI may be received with an 
authenticating witness provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of 
Evidence.” (see ISCR Case No. 11-13999 (App. Bd., February 3, 2014)).  
 
Although Applicant, who is representing himself, has not raised the issue via an 
objection, I am raising it sua sponte because Item 3 is not properly authenticated. 
Applicant’s failure to mention this issue in a response to the FORM is not a knowing 
waiver of the rule because he more than likely was unaware of the rule.  Waiver means 
“the voluntary relinquishment or abandonment – express or implied – of a legal right or 
advantage, the party alleged to have waived a right must have had both knowledge of 
the existing right and the intention of forgoing it.” Black’s Law Dictionary, 1717 (Bryan A. 
Garner, editor-in-chief, 9th ed., West 2009).  
 
While Department Counsel mentions the authentication requirement of ¶ E3.1.20 
of the Directive in Footnote 1 of the FORM without directly citing it, I cannot conclude 
Applicant expressly waived this rule because he did not submit a response to the 
FORM. In accordance with the Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.20, Item 3 is not 
admissible and will not be considered in this decision.   
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits the SOR allegations. (Item 1)    
 
 Applicant is an employee of a DOD contractor seeking to maintain his security 
clearance. He has worked for his current employer since April 1992. He has some  
college credit. He is married and has two children. (Item 2)   
 
On July 24, 2012, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigation Processing (e-QIP). In response to Section 26 – Delinquency Involving 
Routine Accounts, Applicant listed several delinquent accounts. (Item 3, section 26) A 
subsequent background investigation revealed the following delinquent accounts which 
are alleged in the SOR: a $10,183 credit card account that was charged off in 
September 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.a: Item 4 at 2; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 7); a $12,104 credit card 
account that was charged off in September 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.b: Item 4 at 3; Item 5 at 2; 
Item 6 at 4); a $1,238 account that was charged off in September 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.c: 
Item 4 at 7); and a $15,521 credit card account that was charged off and placed for 
collection in June 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.d: Item 6 at 5, 14).  
 
In his response to the SOR, Applicant states that he formally disputed all four of 
the debts alleged in the SOR. He is not disputing that he owes the debts, but wants to 
 
3 
 
 
verify the actual amount owed. He also wants to make sure that the laws of his state of 
residence and the Fair Credit Reporting Act are being followed. Once he receives this 
information, he will work to resolve these issues. He claims that this has been going on 
for three to five years and he has not heard anything.  He did not provide copies of the 
dispute letters. He has not made arrangements with any of the creditors towards 
resolving these accounts. (Item 1) 
 
Applicant states that he does not have any gambling problems, substance abuse 
problems, or alcohol problems. He does not have a criminal record. He has had a 
security clearance for over 25 years without incident. (Item 1)  
 
Applicant did not provide any character references, performance evaluations, or 
awards that could be considered under the whole person.  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered when 
determining an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), 
the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
 
4 
 
 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security 
concerns. I find AG &19(a) (an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG &19(c) 
(a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply to Applicant’s case. Applicant 
encountered financial problems since about 2010.  The SOR alleges four delinquent 
accounts with a total balance of approximately $39,046. These debts are unresolved. 
Both AG &19(a) and AG &19(c) apply.   
 
An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified information. Behaving 
irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in 
other aspects of life. A person’s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until 
evidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under 
agreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an 
applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk 
inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be 
debt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial 
obligations.  
 
 
5 
 
 
The Government’s substantial evidence and Applicant’s admissions raise 
security concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce 
evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive ¶ 
E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden 
of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially 
apply:  
 
AG & 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment);  
 
AG & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the 
circumstances);  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control);  
  
AG & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts); and  
 
AG & 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the 
legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and 
provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue). 
 
AG & 20(a) does not apply. Applicant incurred the delinquent accounts alleged in 
the SOR more than five years ago. The debts were charged off or placed for collection  
in 2010 and 2011.  While Applicant states that he formally disputed each debt, he did 
not provide copies of the letters he sent to each creditor. He mentions that his attempts 
at disputing the debts have lasted between three to five years. It is not clear whether he 
followed up on his initial disputes or if he was passively waiting for the creditors to 
contact him. Each debt alleged in the SOR remains unresolved. Applicant’s financial 
issues are ongoing.  
 
AG & 20(b) does not apply. Applicant did not mention circumstances beyond his 
control that contributed to his financial situation.  
 
 
6 
 
 
AG & 20(c) does not apply because Applicant did not attend financial counseling. 
The status of his delinquent accounts remain unresolved. His financial situation remains 
uncertain.  
 
AG & 20(d) does not apply, because Applicant did not demonstrate that he made 
a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent accounts. He apparently disputed the 
amounts of the debts several years ago, but did not follow up on attempting to resolve 
the accounts such as by entering into a repayment plan or negotiating a settlement for a 
lesser amount. Applicant’s efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts were minimal. He 
could have been more proactive in resolving his delinquent accounts.  
 
AG & 20(e) does not apply. While Applicant says that he disputed all four debts 
alleged in the SOR, he is not disputing that he owes them. He is disputing the balance 
of each debt. Applicant did not provide evidence indicating that he has a reasonable 
basis to dispute the debts and did not provide evidence of what steps he took to resolve 
the issue. It appears he disputed these debts several years ago, but was not proactive 
in following up to resolve the issue.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. 
 
 In requesting an administrative determination, Applicant chose to rely on the 
written record. However, he failed to submit sufficient information or evidence to 
supplement the record with relevant and material facts that would mitigate financial 
considerations security concerns. While Applicant disputed all four debts, he does not 
deny that he owes the debts. He is disputing the balance. He has not taken action 
towards attempting to resolve these accounts, such as entering into a repayment 
agreement with each creditor. It is unknown whether Applicant has sufficient income to 
 
7 
 
 
meet his financial obligations. Applicant did not mitigate the concerns arising from 
financial considerations. 
 
 The determination of an individual’s eligibility for a security clearance is not a 
once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying 
and mitigating to the evidence presented. Under Applicant’s current circumstances, the 
granting of a security clearance is not warranted. In the future, if Applicant takes 
proactive steps towards resolving his delinquent accounts and establishes a track 
record of repayment, he may demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security 
worthiness.  
        
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant’s 24 years of 
service with his employer. In the future, he may be able to demonstrate a track record of 
resolving his financial obligations. It is too soon to make that conclusion at this point. 
The security concerns raised under financial considerations are not mitigated.  
 
Formal Findings 
  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
 Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.d:    Against Applicant 
  
     Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
