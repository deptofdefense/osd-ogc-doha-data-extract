HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges discharge of her nonpriority 
unsecured debts in October 2007 through Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and 19 
delinquent debts totaling $22,648. Applicant’s delinquent debts were the result of limited 
income while on short-term disability and her serious medical problems. She paid four 
SOR debts, and five SOR debts are in payment plans. Five SOR debts do not have 
payment plans and remain unresolved. The balance owed on her SOR debts is 
$16,799. Several non-SOR debts are paid or are in current payment plans. She is 
communicating with her creditors, and has assured she intends to pay her debts. While 
additional sustained financial effort is necessary, she has established a track record of 
debt payment and resolution. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. 
Access to classified information is granted.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On August 6, 2014, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On August 24, 2015, the 
Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an 
SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006. 
 
 
2 
                                         
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the 
SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. 
 
On September 17, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR, and she requested a 
hearing. On December 4, 2015, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On 
January 28, 2016, the case was assigned to me. On February 8, 2016, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing 
for February 24, 2016. (HE 1) Applicant waived her right to 15 days of notice of the 
date, time, and location of her hearing. (Tr. 14) The hearing was held as scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits, and Applicant 
offered six exhibits, which were admitted into evidence without objection. (Transcript 
(Tr.) 16-20; Government Exhibit (GE) 1-5; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-F) On March 3, 
2015, DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the hearing. On March 7, 2015, 
Applicant provided 17 additional exhibits, which were admitted without objection. (AE G-
W) The record closed on March 11, 2016. (Tr. 74) 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 
1.t. She also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions 
are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (Tr. 6, 20) She has 
served as a special police officer and held a security clearance for the previous 15 
years. (Tr. 8, 23) In 1995, Applicant graduated from high school. (Tr. 6) She needs two 
additional courses to obtain her associate’s degree in criminal justice. (Tr. 6-8, 21) In 
1998, she married, and she has five children, who are ages 8, 11, 16, 22, and 25. (Tr. 6-
7, 20-21; GE 1) Three of her children continue to live in her home. (Tr. 7, 21) Her 
husband works in construction. (Tr. 8) She has never served in the military. (Tr. 7)    
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Prior to 2007, Appellant was ill, and it was necessary for her to go on short-term 
disability, significantly reducing her income. After Applicant’s nonpriority unsecured 
debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, Applicant was again ill 
and had to take several months off from work. (Tr. 33) In August 2015, she was 
diagnosed with cancer. (Tr. 38) She had cancer treatments and major surgery. (Tr. 38, 
69; SOR response) She is currently taking medication to ensure her cancer remains in 
remission. (Tr. 68)  
 
Applicant’s gross monthly salary is about $4,500 and her net monthly income is 
about $3,200. (Tr. 24) Her husband’s net monthly income is about $2,800. (Tr. 24) Their 
monthly rent is $1,500. (Tr. 26) They are making car payments on two vehicles. (Tr. 27) 
 
3 
                                         
 
She estimated that she and her husband have a remainder of about $1,000 at the end 
of each month. (Tr. 28) 
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges 19 delinquent debts totaling $22,648. Their status is as 
follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a indicates, and Applicant agreed, that her nonpriority unsecured debts 
were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in October 2007. Applicant 
had pregnancy-related medical problems, and she was unable to work. (Tr. 30) She 
was receiving short-term disability, which was about half of her pay. (Tr. 30)  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.n, and 1.o allege four education debts that are past due in the 
following amounts: $374; $225; $91; and $153. (Tr. 59-60) The four accounts were 
transferred and consolidated into the education debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.p and 1.q for $585 
and $352. (Tr. 33-35; SOR response) Applicant has been consistently making $50 
monthly payments since November 2014 to address the two student loans. (SOR 
response at 7-9, 15; AE G) On January 5, 2016, the creditor wrote the balance owed is 
$648, and the debt is in current status. (AE A) She also owes $3,398 and $1,883 on two 
other education accounts that are in current status, as she pays $65 monthly to the 
creditor. (Tr. 60-61; AE S-U) 
    
SOR ¶ 1.d is a telecommunications debt for $911, and SOR ¶ 1.l is a 
telecommunications debt for $912. (Tr. 35-37) SOR ¶ 1.l is a duplication of the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.d. (Tr. 58; SOR response) She purchased a phone for her daughter, who was 
living in another state. (Tr. 39) Her daughter was involved in an abusive marriage, and 
Applicant wanted to support her daughter. (Tr. 39-40) Her son-in-law was arrested for 
the attempted murder of his girlfriend. (Tr. 39-40) Applicant said she made a payment of 
$160 and brought her account to current status. (AE G) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e is an alleged mortgage debt for $15,077. Her 2014 credit report 
shows a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured mortgage loan with a balance of 
$159,962, high credit of $150,460, and past due amount of $15,077. (GE 5) In 2010, 
Applicant signed a mortgage to enable her to purchase her residence. (AE F at 6) 
Applicant was unable to pay her mortgage because she was out of work and on short-
term disability. She requested a loan modification; however, it was not approved. (Tr. 
38-39) Her residence was foreclosed in May 2015.  
 
A lawyer sent Applicant a suggested audit statement indicating as follows: her 
property was sold for $182,383; the mortgage company charged her $2,500 in attorney 
fees; she was charged a five percent trustee commission of $9,119; she was also 
charged more than $10,000 in interest from July 2013 to May 2015; and she owed a 
deficiency of $7,613. (SOR response at 13-14)1 The suggested audit did not ask her to 
pay the deficiency. (Tr. 41; SOR response) Her 2015 credit report does not show this 
                                            
1 Under some programs, FHA will pay some types of closing costs for the sale of real estate in 
connection with a foreclosure. See United States Department of Housing and Urban Development 
website, https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=DOC 14627.pdf (HE 4).

debt. Applicant disputed the claim in the letter that she had not paid her mortgage from 
July 2013 to May 2015. (Tr. 43-45)  
 
The lawyer who generated the suggested audit advised Applicant that he did not 
seek a deficiency, and the debt was transferred to another entity. (AE G) On February 
26, 2016, she contacted the entity. She was advised that her account did not show a 
deficiency. (AE G) She did not make any payments on this debt because she was 
unsure of the current holder of the debt. (Tr. 47) In the state where her home was 
located, the court must approve the audit report, and then the creditor has three years 
to seek a deficiency judgment.2 There is no evidence that a court approved the 
deficiency or that a deficiency judgment has been sought. Applicant has maintained 
contact with the creditor. (Tr. 47-50)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.g is a medical debt for $95. In November 2014, she paid this debt in full. 
(Tr. 50-51; SOR response at 10; AE C; GE 4) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h is a medical debt for $261. (Tr. 52) Applicant contacted the creditor; 
however, the creditor wanted a payment over the telephone, and she wanted a letter 
from the creditor. (Tr. 51-53) She wanted to be sure the bill was not covered by her 
medical insurance. (Tr. 52) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i is a debt resulting from an online university course for $541. On 
September 9, 2015, the university provided an account statement indicating Applicant 
made multiple payments over several years, and a zero balance was currently owed. 
(Tr. 53-54; SOR response at 3-6; AE D; AE E) She is enrolling in additional classes at 
this university to enable her to complete her associate’s degree. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.j and 1.s are two telecommunications debts owed to the same company 
for $786 and $1,559. Applicant has a payment arrangement with the creditor to pay $62 
monthly. (Tr. 54-57, 62) She believed the debt for $1,559 was going to be paid by her 
new cell phone carrier; however, it was not paid. (Tr. 63) She contacted the creditor, 
and she is waiting for a settlement offer on the $1,559 debt. (Tr. 63)    
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.k, and 1.m are three medical debts for $132, $102, and $177. 
(SOR response) SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.k related to the same debt. (Tr. 58) Applicant said 
she paid the medical debt in ¶ 1.f and 1.k; however, she was unable to locate the debt 
in SOR ¶ 1.m. (Tr. 57-59; AE G) She believed her medical debts were current as she is 
able to see the doctor, and her doctor’s office advises that she has a zero balance 
owed. (Tr. 59)  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.r and 1.t are bank debts for $175 and $140. SOR ¶ 1.r is a duplication 
of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.t. In November 2015, she paid a $285 debt owed to a bank. (Tr. 
61, 64; AE B; AE V) 
                                            
2General information about the foreclosure process and deficiencies in the state where Applicant 
lives is available at Nolo Law, http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/deficiency-judgments-after-
foreclosure-maryland.html.  
 
5 
                                         
 
In sum, Applicant’s seven SOR education debts in SOR 1.b., 1.c, 1.i, 1.n, 1.o, 
1.p, and 1.q are actually five debts for $5,929 with one being paid and the other four 
being in current payment plans. The two bank debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.r and 1.t are paid. The 
three medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, and 1.k are paid, and the two medical debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.m are unresolved. The four telecommunications debts in SOR ¶ 1.d, 
1.j, 1.l, and 1.s are actually three debts totaling $3,257. One of the telecommunications 
debts is in a payment plan, and she has not addressed the other two 
telecommunications debts. SOR ¶ 1.e is a possible $7,613 deficiency resulting from the 
repossession of her residence.  
 
Applicant’s SOR does not allege Applicant failed to pay her taxes in full when 
due. Applicant’s federal taxes were delinquent in the amount of $4,000 for the 2014 tax 
year because she made a mistake on her tax return. (Tr. 65, 70-71) She is paying $100 
monthly to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and $69 monthly to address state taxes 
owed for 2014. (Tr. 66) She did not provide any documentation to show the situation 
concerning her state and federal taxes. (Tr. 67) She was unable to explain the mistake 
she made on her tax return. (Tr. 65-71)  
 
Applicant has not received financial counseling. (Tr. 68) Her 2015 credit report 
shows five collection accounts with a total balance of $1,591. (GE 4) One debt for $912 
is a telecommunications account, and the other four debts totaling $672 are medical 
debts. (GE 4) Her 2015 credit report also shows the following past-due debts: education 
debts for $91, $153, $585, and $352; a credit card debt for $175 and $140; and 
telecommunications debts for $1,559 and $786. (GE 4) Her 2015 credit report shows 
numerous accounts in paid or paid-as-agreed status. Her two most prominent debts are 
for two vehicles in the amounts of $41,910 and $34,867, with monthly payments of $886 
and $638 respectively. (GE 4)    
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
 
6 
                                         
 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
 
7 
                                         
 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt 
is documented in her credit reports, SF 86, SOR response, and hearing record. 
Applicant’s SOR alleges a bankruptcy discharge of her nonpriority unsecured debts in 
October 2007, and 19 delinquent debts totaling $22,648. Seven of the debts on the 
SOR were duplications, and the amounts of several debts were different than the 
amounts alleged on the SOR. The Government established the disqualifying conditions 
in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of 
mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;3 and  
 
                                            
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   
 
8 
                                         
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a) through 20(d) apply. Applicant’s financial problems resulted from 
Applicant’s serious medical problems including cancer and major surgery. Her medical 
problems, in turn, resulted in medical debts and loss of income from her employer, as 
she went from full-time employment to periods of short-term disability.  
 
Applicant’s nonpriority unsecured debts were discharged in October 2007 
through Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. She paid four SOR debts, and five SOR 
debts are in payment plans. Five SOR debts do not have payment plans and remain 
unresolved. The balance owed on her SOR debts is $16,799. Several non-SOR debts 
are paid or are in current payment plans. She is communicating with her creditors, and 
has assured she intends to pay her debts. She has established a track record of debt 
payment and resolution.  
 
The creditor holding Applicant’s FHA mortgage-related debt for $7,616 may not 
be seeking payment. Applicant has the burden of establishing the status of this debt; 
however, despite making repeated inquiries she has not been able to ascertain the 
status of this debt. Her most recent credit report does not list this debt. I am confident 
that if the creditor seeks payment, Applicant will conscientiously endeavor to resolve 
this debt. 
 
Based on Applicant’s credible and sincere promise to timely pay her debts, future 
new delinquent debt “is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on [Applicant’s] current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” and “there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control.” Her payments of some of her debts 
showed good faith. She has sufficient income to keep her debts in current status and to 
continue making progress paying her remaining delinquent debts. Her efforts are 
 
9 
                                         
 
sufficient to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Even if Applicant 
provided insufficient information to mitigate security concerns under AG ¶ 20, she 
mitigated security concerns under the whole-person concept, infra. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has served as 
a special police officer and held a security clearance for the previous 15 years. She 
needs two additional courses to obtain her associate’s degree in criminal justice. She 
has five children, who are ages 8, 11, 16, 22, and 25. Three of her children continue to 
live in her home. There is no evidence of security violations, abuse of alcohol or drugs, 
or criminal activity.     
 
Applicant’s nonpriority unsecured debts were discharged in October 2007 
through Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The SOR alleged 19 delinquent debts 
totaling $22,648. Seven SOR debts were duplicated by other SOR debts. Her debts 
were the result of limited income while she was on short-term disability and due to her 
serious medical problems. She paid four SOR debts, and five SOR debts are in 
payment plans. Five SOR debts do not have payment plans. The balance owed on her 
SOR debts is $16,799. Several non-SOR debts are paid or are in current payment 
plans, including two vehicle loans totaling about $70,000. She is communicating with 
her creditors, and has assured she intends to pay her debts. She understands that she 
needs to pay her debts, and the conduct required to retain her security clearance. The 
Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial 
cases stating:  
 
 
10 
                                         
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence 
of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant 
is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted). Applicant has established a “meaningful track record” of debt 
re-payment, and I am confident she will maintain her financial responsibility.4 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.t:   For Applicant  
 
                                            
4The Government has the option of following-up with more questions about Applicant’s finances. 
The Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit reports, 
investigation, and interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the Government from 
subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the security 
significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative security 
significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). Violation of a promise made in a 
security context to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may 
support future revocation of a security clearance. An administrative judge does not have “authority to 
grant an interim, conditional, or probationary clearance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 
2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 04-03907 
at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006) (stating, “The Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or 
probationary security clearance to allow [the applicant] the opportunity to have a security clearance while 
[the applicant] works on [his or] her financial problems.”). This footnote does not imply that this decision to 
grant Applicant’s security clearance is conditional.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
