Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny him eligibility for
access to classified information. Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut,
explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts proven by the written record concerning his
history of financial problems. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant. 
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on October 26, 2012.  About three years later on September1
30, 2015, after reviewing the application and information gathered during a background
investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD)  sent Applicant a statement of reasons2
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.    
 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.7. 4
 The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documents, some5
of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.

(SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to3
a complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action under the security guideline known as
Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant answered the SOR on November 3,
2015, with a two-page memorandum.   
Neither Applicant nor Department Counsel requested a hearing, and so the case
will be decided on the written record.  On December 29, 2015, Department Counsel4
submitted all relevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing.  This5
file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant, who received it on January 15,
2016. He did not reply within the 30-day period from receipt of the FORM. The case was
assigned to me on March 29, 2016.   
Procedural Matters 
The FORM includes Exhibit 5, which is a report of investigation (ROI)
summarizing Applicant’s interview that took place during the December 2012
background investigation. The summary, Exhibit 5, is not authenticated by a witness as
required under ¶ E3.1.20 of the Directive. Department Counsel’s written brief includes a
footnote advising Applicant that the summary was not authenticated and that failure to
object may constitute a waiver of the authentication requirement. Nevertheless, a pro se
applicant’s failure to respond to the FORM does not equate to a waiver of the
authentication requirement.  The written record does not demonstrate that Applicant6
understood the legal concepts of authentication, waiver, and admissibility. It also does
not establish that he understood the implications of waiving an objection to the
admissibility of the summary. Accordingly, except as otherwise stated below, Exhibit 5 is
inadmissible and I have not considered it.

 Exhibits 6 and 7. 9

was not part of the summarized interview of Applicant.

Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 54-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance
for his job as a system engineer.  He has been so employed since 2004. Before that, he7
worked as a senior field engineer for another federal contractor from 1990 to 2004. In
other words, he has been continuously employed for the last 25 years. His employment
history includes honorable service (reserve duty) with the U.S. Army during 1980–1990.
He has been married and divorced three times; his most recent divorce was in 2012;
and he has four children, born between 1997 and 2009. His educational background
includes some college during 2003. 
Applicant disclosed a history of financial problems in his October 2012 security
clearance application.  In response to Section 26 of the application, he reported a failure8
to file federal income tax returns for tax years 2007, 2008, and 2009, due to a delay
associated with his spouse’s business, which was tied to their joint return. He stated
that the returns were filed in 2010. He also reported six other delinquent accounts.
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges a history of financial problems consisting of
the following matters: (1) seven collection accounts for a total of approximately $49,722;
(2) two charged-off accounts for a total of approximately $17,543; (3) ten medical
collection accounts for a total of $1,149; (4) a past-due real estate mortgage loan in the
amount of $4,606 with a balance of $227,976; (5) a past-due (120 days or more) credit
card account in the amount of $2,568 with a balance of $13,184; (6) an unpaid state tax
lien entered in June 2010 for $1,650; and (7) an unpaid judgment entered in April 2009
for $30,556. Applicant admitted some of these matters in his answer to the SOR.
Further, these matters are established by credit reports, which were obtained during the
security clearance process in 2012 and 2015.  9
The written record also establishes that Applicant satisfied the $30,556 judgment
in SOR ¶ 1.m in 2010. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the judgment
stemmed from a business debt incurred by his former spouse, it was a default judgment
obtained against both of them, and he paid it in full in 2010. In addition, the background
investigation shows the judgment was satisfied, by wage garnishment, in August 2010.10
Otherwise, Applicant has not provided documentation showing that the remaining
delinquent accounts in the SOR are paid, settled, subject to a repayment agreement, in
dispute, cancelled, forgiven, or otherwise resolved. His various claims and assertions in
his answer to the SOR are not supported by documentation. Indeed, other than the two-

Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As11
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt12
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An13
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  14
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting15
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An16
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate17
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme18
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.19
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.20

financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In
security clearance cases, “the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances
surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation
omitted). 
 AG ¶ 18.  24

The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it21
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant22
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 23
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  24
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly compromise
classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It encompasses
concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important qualities. A
person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or
negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial
history within the meaning of Guideline F.  I reach that conclusion based on the25
findings of fact that show, other than the judgment, Applicant has done very little to
 AG ¶ 20(a)–(f).26
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).27

address his financial problems, which date back to at least 2012 when he completed the
security clearance application. With that said, I have little concern about the ten medical
collection accounts for a total of $1,149. (SOR ¶¶ 1.e–1.k, 1.q, 1.r, and 1.v) First, it is
presumed that these debts were incurred for necessary medical expenses as opposed
to frivolous or irresponsible spending. Likewise, the medical collection accounts do not
suggest poor self-control or lack of judgment. Second, the amounts are minor, ranging
from $50 to $214, which is indicative of co-payments and the like in medical billing.   
 In mitigation, I have considered the six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,26
and conclude that Applicant has not presented sufficient information to rebut, explain,
extenuate, or mitigate the facts proven by the written record. He receives some credit
for taking care of the judgment in 2010, but the credit is limited because the judgment
was paid by wage garnishment, which is not truly voluntary. The totality of the written
record does not show that Applicant has a reasonable plan to resolve the delinquent
debts and has demonstrated a firm commitment to adhering to that plan. The facts do
not support application of AG ¶ 20(c), the problem is being resolved or is under control,
or AG ¶ 20(d), making a good-faith effort to repay.            
    
The concern over Applicant’s problematic financial history creates doubt about
his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified
information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and
considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice
versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I27
conclude that he did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified
information.
