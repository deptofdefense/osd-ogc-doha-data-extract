Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny him eligibility for
access to classified information. Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain
and mitigate the concern stemming from a history of financial problems. But he did
present sufficient information to establish that he did not deliberately omit relevant
information about his problematic financial history when he submitted a security
clearance application in 2012. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on November 5, 2012.  About three years later on October 17,1
2015, after reviewing the application and information gathered during a background
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD)  sent Applicant a statement of reasons2
(SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to3
a complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action under the security guidelines known
as Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline E for personal conduct.
Applicant answered the SOR on November 5, 2015, with handwritten responses to each
allegation in the SOR, a two-page memorandum, and several enclosures.  
Neither Applicant nor Department Counsel requested a hearing, and so the case
will be decided on the written record.  On December 8, 2015, Department Counsel4
submitted all relevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing.  This5
file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant, who received it on December
21, 2015. He did not reply within the 30-day period from receipt of the FORM. The case
was assigned to me on March 23, 2016.   
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 49-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security clearance
for his job as a payroll analyst. He has been so employed since November 2012. A
review of his security clearance application reveals an irregular or unsteady
employment history.  He has had ten different jobs from July 2002 to present. During6
that same period, he had four periods of unemployment; July 2005 to August 2005;
February 2006 to April 2006; March 2010 to January 2011; and December 2011 to
March 2012. His employment history includes honorable service on active duty with the
U.S. Marine Corps during 1985–1989. He is married, but separated since 2010. His
educational background includes a high school diploma and some college.

Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges a history of financial problems consisting of
the following matters: (1) a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, which was filed in 2007 and
dismissed before completion of the payment plan in 2008; (2) two unpaid judgments for
a total of about $17,681; and (3) 19 collection or charged-off accounts for a total of
about $34,816. The largest debt is a $19,099 charged-off account stemming from an
unsecured mortgage loan. The allegations are established by Applicant’s admissions as
reflected in his answer to the SOR. And the allegations are established by credit
reports, which were obtained during the security clearance process in 2012 and 2015.  7
The written record also establishes that he satisfied the $15,805 judgment in
SOR ¶ 1.b in 2015.  The other judgment remains unsatisfied.  He also paid the8 9
delinquent accounts for $3,318 and $531 in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.j.  As far as I can10
determine, he has not provided documentation showing that the remaining delinquent
accounts in the SOR have been paid, settled, subject to a repayment agreement,
cancelled, forgiven, or otherwise resolved. His assertion in his answer to the SOR that
he paid other delinquent accounts in the SOR is not supported by the November 11,
2015 credit report he included with his answer.
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified material facts in
response to two questions in Section 26 of his November 5, 2012 security clearance
application.  The allegations are based on his omission of the delinquent accounts as11
well as the judgments that were in existence when he submitted the application. Indeed,
he disclosed his 2007–2008 Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, but no other adverse financial
matters. 
Applicant explained and clarified in his answer to the SOR that there was some
confusion or uncertainty on his part when he submitted his security clearance
application.  His confusion or uncertainty was due to an uncompleted or draft security12
clearance application from the same time. In that document he disclosed (1) the
Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, (2) the $15,508 judgment, (3) a bad debt for $675, (4) a
bad debt for $737, (5) a foreclosed  mortgage loan, (6) a repossession of a vehicle, (7)
a bad debt for $513, and (8) a bad debt for $508.  As a result, he understood the13
information from the previous  application would be included and he only had to update
the current application.

Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As14
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt15
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An16
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  17
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting18
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An19
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate20
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme21
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.22
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.23
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense

 AG ¶¶ 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 25
 ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that “the security suitability of an applicant26
is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness or recurring
financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In
security clearance cases, “the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances
surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation
omitted).

decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it24
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant25
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 26
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  27
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly compromise
classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It encompasses
concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important qualities. A
person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or
negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial
history within the meaning of Guideline F.  I reach that conclusion based on Applicant’s28
Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, which ended unsuccessfully with a dismissal in 2008, and
the approximately $30,000 in unresolved delinquent accounts. 
 AG ¶ 20(a)–(f).29
 AG ¶¶ 15, 16, and 17 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 30
 AG ¶ 15. 31

 In mitigation, I have considered the six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,29
and conclude that Applicant has not presented sufficient information to explain and
mitigate the concern. He receives some credit for taking care of the largest judgment
and two delinquent accounts. But his assertion that he paid additional delinquent
accounts is not supported by the written record. His assertion may be based on the
mistaken notion that simply because a debt ages off or no longer appears on his recent
credit report from November 2015, it has been resolved, which is not the case. The
totality of the written record does not show that Applicant has a reasonable plan to
resolve the delinquent debts and has demonstrated a firm commitment to adhering to
that plan. The facts do not support application of AG ¶ 20(c), the problem is being
resolved or is under control, or AG ¶ 20(d), making a good-faith effort to repay.               
Personal conduct under Guideline E  is a concern because it asks the central30
question if a person’s past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to
properly handle and safeguard classified information. The suitability of an applicant may
be questioned or put into doubt when an applicant engages in conduct involving
questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with the
rules and regulations. And “of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and
candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate
with the security clearance process.”  31
The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any
written document or oral statement to the Government when applying for a security
clearance or in other official matters is a concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly
and willfully. An omission of relevant and material information, for example, is not
deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it,
misunderstood the question, or thought the information did not need to be reported. 
Applicant provided a sufficient explanation along with documentation to rebut the
allegations that he deliberately failed to disclose the judgments and delinquent accounts
when he completed his 2012 security clearance application. First, he disclosed the
Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, which is certainly adverse information. Second, he
presented documentation to support his explanation that he disclosed additional
adverse financial matters in an uncompleted or draft security clearance application,
which he thought would be included in his current application. Taken together, those
matters persuade me that he was not attempting to deliberately omit, hide, or conceal
his problematic financial history.   
The concern over Applicant’s financial history creates doubt about his current
reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).32
7
reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the
favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due
consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I conclude that he did not32
meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.v: Against Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline E: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 2.a–2.b: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
