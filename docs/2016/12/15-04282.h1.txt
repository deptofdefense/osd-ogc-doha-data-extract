Decision
______________
MALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:
Applicant did not file or pay his federal and state income taxes as required for the
tax years 2007 through 2012. In 2013, he filed all of his past-due returns and has filed
his returns as required since then. He entered into federal and state repayment plans in
2014. The state debt is nearly satisfied. Applicant also incurred significant delinquent or
past-due commercial debt after he and his wife separated in 2015. His recent decision
to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection was prudent under the circumstances.
Applicant’s request for a security clearance is granted.
Statement of the Case
On October 14, 2014, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for
Investigations Processing (EQIP) to obtain or renew a security clearance required for
his employment with a defense contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing
background investigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not
determine that it is clearly consistent with the national interest for Applicant to have a
security clearance.  1
 The adjudicative guidelines were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. These2
guidelines were published in the Federal Register and codified through 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).
 In Applicant’s initial SOR response, dated January 2, 2016, he asked for a decision without a hearing.3
However, on April 8, 2016, he asked that his case be converted to a hearing.
 At Department Counsel’s request, I have included, as Hearing Exhibit (Hx.) 1, a copy of the May 3, 20164
letter that forwarded Gx. 1 - 3 to Applicant, in accordance with Directive Section E3.1.13. Also included, as
Hx. 2, is a list identifying those exhibits.
 Department Counsel’s email forwarding Ax. D - G and waiving objection thereto is included as Hx. 3. Ax. D5
consists of five letters from the IRS, all dated May 6, 2013, advising Applicant of his failure to file tax returns
for 2007 through 2011. Ax. E consists of the front pages of federal income tax returns for 2007 through 2011.
It also contains the second pages of federal income tax returns for 2012 - 2015. The front pages of the 2007 -
2009 returns are stamped as filed with the IRS between June and July 2013. The front pages of the returns
for 2010 and 2011 are stamped as filed in October 2013. The 2012 second page reflects that the return for
that tax year was filed in October 2013. The 2013 - 2015 second pages show they were filed in April of 2014 -
2016, respectively. Ax. F contains information (4 pages) pertaining to Applicant’s claims of repayment
agreements with state and federal tax authorities. Ax. G (two pages) consists of copies of six money orders
proffered as proof of Chapter 13 bankruptcy payments. Three of the copies have the word “June” handwritten
on them, but none are actually dated and no payee is noted on any of the receipts. However, the total amounts
reflected in the receipts are equal to Applicant’s monthly Chapter 13 payments.

On December 10, 2015, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging
facts which raise security concerns addressed under the adjudicative guideline  for2
financial considerations (Guideline F). Applicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer)
and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned me on May 18, 2016, and I convened3
a hearing on June 29, 2016. The parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel
presented Government Exhibits (Gx.) 1 - 3.  Applicant testified in his own behalf and4
submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (Ax.) A - C. All exhibits were admitted without objection. I
left the record open after the hearing to receive additional relevant information. The
record closed on July 7, 2016, when I admitted, without objection, Applicant’s post-
hearing submissions as Ax. D - G.   A transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on5
July 13, 2016.
Findings of Fact
Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $67,433 for
unpaid federal taxes being enforced through a 2014 tax lien (SOR 1.a) and $8,500 for
unpaid state taxes in tax years 2007 through 2012 (SOR 1.b). It was also alleged that
Applicant had not filed federal and state returns, or paid his federal and state taxes for
tax years 2007 through 2012 (SOR 1.c). The SOR also presented allegations that
Applicant owes another $19,636 for seven delinquent or past-due commercial debts
(SOR 1.d - 1.j). In response, Applicant denied SOR 1.h and took issue with the amount
of debt actually owed. He admitted the remaining SOR allegations. In addition to the
facts thus established, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old and works for a defense contractor in a position for
which he was first hired in February 2007. He previously worked in similar positions for
two different contractors between April 2004 and February 2007. He has held a security
clearance since at least 2005. In April 2004, Applicant retired from the United States
Army after 20 years of honorable service. He married in February 1989 and has two
children, ages 19 and 24. Applicant and his wife have been separated since February
2015. (Answer; Gx. 1; Tr. 5, 48, 58)
 Available returns show Applicant and his wife usually filed separate returns, with his returns filed as “Head6
of Household,”  rather than “Married, Filing Jointly.” (Ax. E)
3
All of Applicant’s defense contractor work between April 2004 and November
2011 was performed overseas. For all intents and purposes, he lived and worked full
time overseas while his family remained in the United States. Applicant would return
periodically for either pre-planned two-week vacations or for a few months in between
projects. Between April 2004 and February 2007, Applicant lived and worked in either
Kuwait or Qatar. Between February 2007 and November 2011, Applicant lived and
worked in Iraq. In Kuwait and Qatar, Applicant was able to manage his affairs relatively
easily. However, his work in Iraq was done under more arduous and austere conditions,
and he was unable to closely mange his affairs at home. (Gx. 1; Tr. 36, 49, 61)
When Applicant started working in Iraq, he gave his wife a power of attorney and
left the handling of their finances and other personal matters to her. Among the
functions she was to handle was the filing of their annual federal and state income tax
returns. Applicant had been able to complete those tasks while he was in Qatar and
Kuwait. But ongoing combat missions and relatively poor support conditions in Iraq
made it impossible for him to tend to his taxes and other affairs. (Answer; Tr. 36, 50 -
54)
As alleged in the SOR, and as he disclosed in his 2014 EQIP, Applicant’s federal
and state income tax returns were not filed for tax years 2007 through 2012 when they
were due. No extensions for any of those tax years were filed either. Applicant averred
that his wife did not file his  returns because she had received informal and inaccurate6
advice from a friend that Applicant did not have to file because he worked overseas.
Although Applicant may receive some relief from his tax liability for income earned
abroad, he always has been required to file annual federal and state returns. (Answer;
Gx. 1; Tr. 53 - 54)
Applicant returned from Iraq in November 2011 and no longer works abroad. In
May 2013, Applicant received notices from the IRS that his 2077 - 2011 returns had not
been received. Applicant claimed he did not know until then that his returns had not
been filed as required. He did not explain why he did not take back responsibility for his
tax returns when he returned. Applicant did present information showing his federal
returns for 2007 through 2012 were filed between June and October 2013; and that his
federal returns for 2013 through 2015 have been timely filed as required. (Answer; Gx.
1; Ax. C - E; Tr. 23 - 25, 55 - 58) 
As alleged in the SOR and disclosed in his EQIP, Applicant incurred delinquent
federal and state tax debts totaling $75,933. Starting in 2012, Applicant also accrued
another $19,633 in personal commercial debts. Applicant claimed those debts arose, in
large part, when he and his wife separated and her income was removed from the
household finances. In April 2016, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection.
His petition addressed debts totaling $216,100, and he is required to pay $2,500 each
month for five years. The mail order receipts in Ax. G appear to represent his first two
Chapter 13 payments. (Answer; Gx. 1; Ax. A - C; Ax. G; Tr. 39 - 40, 42 - 46, 58 - 59)
In March and April 2014, Applicant entered into repayment agreements with both
the IRS and his state’s tax authority. Applicant pays the IRS $200 each month to satisfy
a $67,000 tax lien against him. Initially, the state repayment plan he established in 2014
required him to pay $175 each month, which was taken directly from his bank account.
Now his state tax debt is included in his Chapter 13 repayment plan. Also, his

bankruptcy attorney recently advised Applicant that, due to the passage of time,
Applicant will have to pay only for his 2013 state taxes. As a result, his original $8,500
state tax debt, already reduced through two years of monthly payments, is now $753.
(Answer; Gx. 1; Ax. B; Ax. F; Tr. 60)
Applicant testified that his finances are currently sound. After paying all of his
regular obligations, including his payments to the IRS and the bankruptcy trustee, he
claims to have about $1,000 remaining each month. Other than completing the course
in financial management that is a prerequisite for filing bankruptcy, Applicant has not
engaged in any professional financial counseling or other assistance for his financial
problems. (Tr. 40 - 47, 72 - 74)
Policies
Each security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense
determination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,7
and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative
guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in ¶ 2(a)
of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the “whole-person” concept, those factors
are:
(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the
individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not
determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they
represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified
information.
A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly
consistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to8
have access to classified information. The Government bears the initial burden of
producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or
revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the Government must be able
to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it
then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government’s case.
Because no one has a “right” to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy
burden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a9
fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the
Government has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the
 See Egan; AG ¶ 2(b).10
5
requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national
interests as his or her own. The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard
compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant’s suitability for access in
favor of the Government.10
Analysis
Financial Considerations
The Government established its case through sufficient and reliable information
that supports the SOR allegations under this guideline. The facts established by this
record reasonably raise a security concern about Applicant’s finances that is addressed,
in relevant part, at AG ¶ 18, as follows:
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
More specifically, this record requires application of the disqualifying conditions at
AG ¶¶ 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); 19(c) (a history of not meeting
financial obligations); and 19(g) (failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax
returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same).
I also have considered the following pertinent AG ¶ 20 mitigating conditions:
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
and
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control.
As to Applicant’s failure to file or pay his taxes as required (SOR 1.a - 1.c), the
mitigating conditions at AG ¶ 20(a) - 20(c) apply. Applicant began relying on his wife to
file his returns in 2007, when he began working in Iraq and did not have access to the
resources he needed to file his returns himself. There is no indication he did not file his
returns as required before he went to Iraq. His reliance on his wife was reasonable
under the circumstances, and it was not expected that she would decide not to file in his
absence. But it was still incumbent on Applicant to at least monitor his taxes and other
financial matters when he could. He was irresponsible in his lack of attention to his
6
taxes, especially between his return in November 2011 and his receipt in May 2013 of
IRS letters advising him of his past-due returns. Nonetheless, Applicant filed those
returns within five months of receiving the IRS letters. Further, his returns have since
been timely filed every year starting in April 2014 with the filing of his returns for tax year
2013. Also in 2014, Applicant established repayment plans with the IRS and his state’s
tax authority to repay the taxes he owed for the 2007 - 2012 tax years.
As to Applicant’s other debts, alleged at SOR 1.d - 1.j, Applicant’s October 2014
credit report reflects he was current on most of his obligations. But the November 2015
credit report documents the SOR debts as past-due or delinquent. This information
tends to support Applicant’s claim that these debts became past-due after he and his
wife separated in May 2015 and her income was no longer available to meet the
financial obligations left to Applicant. Under these circumstances, Applicant’s Chapter
13 bankruptcy petition is a prudent step to take in resolving his financial problems. He is
able to make payments and still have sufficient monthly cash flow to with which to avoid
new unpaid debts. On balance, I conclude the foregoing is sufficient to mitigate the
security concerns about Applicant’s finances.
I also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed
in AG ¶ 2(a). Applicant retired after a 20-year career in the Army. Although he neglected
his responsibilities regarding his taxes for several years, his explanation for his conduct
was plausible and he has since corrected his past-due tax obligations. He also has
taken action to resolve more recent personal financial problems stemming from
circumstances beyond his control. There is no indication that Applicant is living beyond
his means, and his current tax situation and personal finances do not reflect adversely
on his judgment. A fair and commonsense assessment of the record as a whole shows
the security concerns raised by the Government’s information are mitigated.
Formal Findings
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.j: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest for
Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant’s request for a security
clearance is granted.
