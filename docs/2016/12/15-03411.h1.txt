HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) includes 15 allegations of delinquent 
debts totaling $17,653. While circumstances beyond her control damaged her finances, 
she did not show enough progress paying or resolving her delinquent debts to mitigate 
financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information 
is denied.       
  
Statement of the Case 
  
On January 13, 2012, Applicant completed and signed her Electronic 
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (e-QIP) or security clearance application 
(SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On December 13, 2015, the Department of 
Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant 
pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), which became effective on 
September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
   
 
2 
 
 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). 
 
On January 26, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR, and she requested a 
hearing. On March 20, 2016, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On July 18, 
2016, the case was assigned to me. On August 11, 2016, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for 
September 9, 2016. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. A letter indicating 
discovery was provided to Applicant before the hearing was attached to the record. 
(Transcript (Tr.) 19; Hearing Exhibit (HE) 4)   
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits, Applicant 
offered nine exhibits; and all proffered exhibits were admitted without objection. (Tr. 19-
23; Government Exhibits (GE) 1-7; Applicant Exhibits (A-I) On September 19, 2016, 
DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the hearing. Applicant provided seven 
documents after her hearing, and all seven documents were admitted without objection. 
(AE J-AE P)  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted all of the SOR allegations. She also 
provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted 
as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 45-year-old legal nurse consultant. (Tr. 7, 9; GE 1) She is a nurse 
and licensed attorney. (Tr. 9) Since 2005, she has provided consultant services in 
connection with medical records reviews for DOD entities, and she advises on whether 
health-care providers have met standard of care requirements. (Tr. 9, 51-52) In 1989, 
she joined the U.S. Army Reserve. (Tr. 7-8) She was an enlisted medical records 
specialist. (Tr. 8) In 1997, she was honorably discharged as a specialist (E-4).  (Tr. 8)  
 
Applicant has never been married. (Tr. 8) Her three children are children are 
ages 9, 13, and 21. (Tr. 9) In 1993, she graduated from college, and she received a 
bachelor’s degree in nursing. (Tr. 10) In 2000, she graduated from law school. (Tr. 10, 
46) She is currently attending a master’s program in a nursing specialty. (Tr. 10)    
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant said $100,000 was spent in custody and child support litigation, which 
encompassed six years. (Tr. 26, 37-42) In 2009, her daughter’s father obtained custody 
of his daughter, who was 15 years old, and Applicant had to pay child support to her 
daughter’s father. (Tr. 40-42) She believed the judgment was satisfied based on the 
                                            
1Some details have been excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is 
available in the cited exhibits.

documentation in the case and some off-the-record discussions. (Tr. 26) Her current 
annual income is $140,000. (Tr. 56, 85) She borrowed $22,000 from her 401(k) account 
to fund her son’s attendance at private school. (Tr. 86) She has student loans totaling 
$22,000 that are in abeyance status. (Tr. 88) Her October 5, 2015 credit report shows 
student loans in abeyance totaling $41,000 from one creditor. (GE 2 at 4)  
 
In 2000, Applicant purchased a home in state O, and she has kept the mortgage 
in current status. (Tr. 24, 50) On March 23, 2016, she refinanced her mortgage; her new 
loan amount is $417,000; and her interest rate is 4.5 percent. (Tr. 25; AE A) In 2006, 
Applicant purchased a residence in state M, (Tr. 56) On March 31, 2016, she refinanced 
her mortgage on her second residence; her current loan amount is $123,310; and her 
interest rate is 4.375 percent. (AE A) Applicant sends her 13-year-old son to a boarding 
school, which costs $20,000 a year. (Tr. 57) At times her rental property was not being 
rented. She recently obtained a tenant for one of her homes, which significantly 
increased her income. (AE P at 11) 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) includes 15 allegations of delinquent 
debts totaling $17,653. At her hearing, she said she paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
($265) and 1.d ($421). (Tr. 97) She disputed her responsibility for payment of the debts 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.h ($9,816) and 1.o ($3,288). After her hearing she provided proof that she 
paid the debts in SOR 1.l ($184). The status of her SOR debts is as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant has a utility debt placed for collection for $265. 
Applicant said she paid a bill from the power company twice. (Tr. 34) Applicant’s 
October 5, 2015 credit report shows the debt as a paid collection account and as an 
unpaid collection account. (GE 2 at 2, 1) Her documentary evidence showing resolution 
is a credit report showing removal of the collection account from her TransUnion Credit 
Report. (Tr. 58-59; AE H at 3; AE P at 6) Applicant is credited with mitigating this debt.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a telecommunications-collection debt for $307. Applicant said 
she asked the telecommunications company where she should send their equipment, 
and she did not recall whether or not she returned their equipment. (Tr. 59-61) The 
telecommunications company told her the equipment was obsolete, and they may not 
have been interested in receiving return of their equipment. (AE P at 6)    
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a collection debt owed to a law firm for $2,143. (Tr. 61) 
Applicant asked a lawyer to stop representing her, and the lawyer continued to 
represent and bill Applicant. (Tr. 62) Her lawyer submitted a document late in a custody 
dispute. (Tr. 62; AE P at 7) She did not send in a dispute to the credit reporting 
companies. (Tr. 63)   
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m, and 1.n allege seven medical-collection debts 
for $421, $32, $68, $102, $308, $251, and $132, respectively. She said she paid the 
medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.d on June 21, 2016. (Tr. 34, 63, 97; AE P at 7, 53) Some of the 
medical debts result from treatments in 2007 or 2010. (Tr. 63; AE P at 8) She said she 
had evidence of her payments. (Tr. 64) She did not recognize the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g, 
   
 
4 
 
 
and she expressed some doubts about the legitimacy of the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.m and 
1.n. (Tr. 69; AE P at 9) She is credited with mitigating the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d. After her 
hearing, she said she would pay the other medical debts; however, the only medical 
debt paid of the seven SOR debts was the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d. (AE P at 8-9)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a charged-off credit card debt for $210. Applicant said as soon 
as she used the card, she was informed the monthly minimum was increased from $10 
to $25, and she refused to pay the balance on the card. (Tr. 64-67; AE P at 7) 
   
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a telecommunications-collection debt for $126. Applicant said 
when she closed her account in 2008, the creditor sent her a $100 check. (Tr. 67) She 
said she did not believe she owed that debt to the creditor. (Tr. 68; AE P at 7) She said 
she did not have any documentation showing the debt was resolved or disputed. (Tr. 
68)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges a home repair collection debt for $9,816. In 2008, Applicant 
signed a contract to have a 12 foot by 15 foot wood deck built next to her house. (Tr. 
69-70, 98-99) Applicant said the contractor dug four holes for support beams for a deck, 
and the deck was being built in the wrong place. (Tr. 70, 97) Two of the four holes were 
next to her home’s foundation, and she said the holes caused a water issue as water 
would settle in the holes. (Tr. 70, 97; SOR response at Ex. H) There was some sinking 
or tilting of a preexisting patio. (Tr. 98) They could also be a trip hazard. (Tr. 70, 98) She 
said the cost to repair the holes would be $20,000 to $30,000. (Tr. 70-71) She offered to 
settle the debt by paying the creditor $3,000. (Tr. 71) The creditor made a $5,000 
counter-offer. (Tr. 71) She said she obtained an estimate in 2014 for $20,000 to make 
repairs; however, she did not provide a copy of the estimate from 2014. (Tr. 71-72) After 
her hearing, she provided an estimate for repairs of $2,500. (AE P at 60) The estimate 
did not discuss how a reasonable homeowner could have mitigated damages by taking 
timely action to fill in the four holes the contractor erroneously dug in her yard. The file 
does not contain the original plans for the deck.   
 
SOR ¶ 1.l alleges a collection debt for $184. On October 6, 2016, Applicant paid 
this debt. (AE P at 9, 58) Applicant is credited with mitigating this debt. 
  
SOR ¶ 1.o alleges that Applicant owes a judgment of $3,288 for attorney’s fees 
that she was ordered to pay relating to family court litigation involving her youngest 
child’s custody and support. On September 9, 2011, a judge granted Applicant’s request 
to stay the payment of the attorney fees. (AE P at 24-42 (decision at 41)) On March 9, 
2012, the family court judge said during a hearing that even if she were credited with 
child support, it may not satisfy the judgment, and more information was needed to 
calculate the net amount owed by the parties. (Tr. 80-83, 93; AE I at 20) On March 14, 
2012, opposing counsel wrote the judge and provided two orders indicating a 
recalculation of Applicant’s debt, and reducing it to $672. (SOR response Ex. I) 
Opposing counsel suggested his client could reduce child support payments by $110 
monthly until the debt was paid. (SOR response Ex. I) The current status of this debt is 
unclear. On April 12, 2016, Applicant wrote the judge who issued a judgment against 
   
 
5 
 
 
her for sanctions (not attorney fees) asking to reopen the issue of her damages. (Tr. 25, 
35, 73-79; AE B) The judge’s secretary returned the letter to Applicant without action, 
and the judge’s secretary indicated she should file documents with the clerk of court 
with a copy to the opposing party. (AE B) Applicant said she believed the judgment was 
satisfied because her child’s father owes her back child support and other monies. (Tr. 
35, 73-81; AE I; AE B) She believes her son’s father engaged in abusive litigation 
designed to cause Applicant economic and emotional pain. (73-89; AE P at 12-17) 
Applicant is credited with mitigating the debt in SOR ¶ 1.o because she has 
documented the dispute over whether she has received sufficient credit for her 
payments and interest owed during the lengthy contested litigation.   
 
On December 2, 2014, a bank creditor for a non-SOR debt offered to forgive 
Applicant’s home equity loan of $91,134 “as part of its recent settlement with the 
Department of Justice.” (AE C) The letter noted there may be income tax ramifications 
due to this debt forgiveness. (AE C) On October 15, 2015, the bank creditor wrote that 
the creditor received a full payoff of the loan. (Tr. 28-29; AE C) 
 
Applicant provided invoices for three bills she questioned as examples of non-
SOR inflated or inappropriate medical or dental charges. (Tr. 30-33; AE D, AE E; AE F) 
She questioned: an invoice for $300 indicating her son received treatment in July 2016; 
an invoice for $274 indicating her daughter received dental treatment in August 2016; 
and an invoice for $200 indicating Applicant received treatment in August 2016. (AE P 
at 47) After her hearing, she provided an additional dental invoice for $369. (AE P at 46) 
She paid some non-SOR telecommunications debts. (AE P at 48-49)     
 
In August 2013, Applicant received a special recognition award from the vice 
president and general manager of her employer. (AE P at 10)  
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
   
 
6 
 
 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
   
 
7 
 
 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt 
is documented in her credit reports, SOR response, and hearing record. The 
Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) requiring 
additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. 
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
  
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   
   
 
8 
 
 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
Applicant presented some important mitigating information. Several 
circumstances beyond her control adversely affected her finances. Applicant was 
embroiled in six years of litigation over custody and support issues. At times her rental 
property was not being rented. She had periods of unemployment or underemployment. 
However, she did not provide enough specifics about how these circumstances over the 
last five years adversely affected her finances. She did not establish that she acted 
responsibly to address her delinquent SOR debts when she had stable employment and 
sufficient income to address the SOR debts.   
 
Applicant in this case may be relying upon the absence of delinquent debts from 
her current credit report to mitigate security concerns. “[T]hat some debts have dropped 
off his [or her] credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution.” ISCR Case 
No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. 
Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative 
financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency or the 
debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is 
longer.3   
 
Several of Applicant’s debts went into default status several years ago and may 
not be legally collectible. All states have statutes of limitations upon collectability of 
credit card debts, which range from three to six years.4 State statutes of limitations 
clearly and unequivocally end an applicant’s legal responsibility to pay the creditor after 
                                            
3Title 15 U.S.C. § 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit 
Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-
reporting-act.pdf.  
 
4See, e.g., Maryland Cts. & Jud. Proc. §§ 5-101 and 5-102(a)(3) (In Maryland  the statute of 
limitations on written contracts and on collection of debts on accounts is three years, and on judgments 
the statute of limitations is 12 years.).

the passage of a certain amount of time, as specified in state law. In a series of 
decisions, the Appeal Board has rejected statutes of limitations for debts generated 
through contracts, which is the law in all 50 states, as significantly mitigating financial 
considerations concerns under AG ¶ 20(d). See ISCR Case No. 08-01122 at 4 (App. 
Bd. Feb. 9, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008); ADP Case 
No. 07-13041 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 2 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 29, 2008) ADP Case No. 06-14616 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2007) (stating, “reliance 
upon legal defenses such as the statute of limitations does not necessarily demonstrate 
prudence, honesty, and reliability; therefore, such reliance is of diminished probative 
value in resolving trustworthiness concerns arising out of financial problems. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).”).  
 
Recently, the DOHA Appeal Board reinforced its position on statutes of 
limitations not mitigating financial considerations concerns stating: 
 
In this case, the Judge noted that Applicant explained that he did not owe 
any of the alleged debts because they had either been deleted from his 
credit report or soon would be deleted, and he also relied on a state 
statute of limitations to absolve himself of debts. The Appeal Board has 
long recognized that debts remain relevant for security clearance 
purposes even if they are no longer enforceable due to the running of the 
statute of limitations or cannot be legally listed on a credit report due to the 
passage of time. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04779 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 
20, 2005) and ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct 26, 2006).5 We 
also have held that reliance on a state’s statute of limitations does not 
constitute a good-faith effort to resolve financial difficulties and is of limited 
mitigative value. ADP Case No. 06-18900 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 03-04779 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2005) and ISCR 
Case No. 01-09691 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003)). 
 
ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016). 
 
Applicant is credited with mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($265); 1.d ($421),  
1.l ($184), and 1.o ($3,288) for the reasons stated in the statement of facts. None of the 
other SOR debts were mitigated because she did not provide sufficient documentation 
showing payment or other good faith attempts to resolve the debt.  
 
Applicant’s annual income is $140,000. There is insufficient evidence about why 
Applicant was unable to make greater documented progress resolving her SOR debts. 
There is insufficient assurance that her financial problems are being resolved, are under 
control, and will not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, she failed to 
establish that financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. 
                                            
5 Compare ISCR Case No. 12-04806 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2014). In that case, Applicant corroborated 
efforts to settle debts that were in “charged-off” status. Also, that Applicant had received financial 
counseling. Ultimately, the Board affirmed the Judge’s favorable decision.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a 45-year-old legal nurse consultant and licensed attorney. Since 
2005, she has provided consultant services in connection with medical records reviews 
for DOD entities, and she advises on whether health-care providers have met standard 
of care requirements. She honorably served in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1989 to 
1997. She is not married, and she has three children, who are ages 9, 13, and 21. In 
1993, she graduated from college, and she received a bachelor’s degree in nursing. In 
2000, she graduated from law school. She is currently attending a master’s program in 
a nursing specialty. She is clearly intelligent and articulate. There are no allegations of 
security violations. 
 
Applicant’s finances were adversely affected by several circumstances beyond 
her control, including: six years of litigation over custody and support issues; at times 
her rental property was not being rented; and she had periods of unemployment or 
underemployment.  
 
The disqualification evidence is more significant. Applicant has a history of 
delinquent debt. Applicant’s SOR includes 15 allegations of delinquent debts totaling 
$17,653. Applicant is credited with mitigating the debts in SOR ¶ 1.a ($265); ¶ 1.d 
($421), ¶ 1.l ($184), and ¶ 1.o ($3,228). Applicant’s annual income is $140,000. As a 
licensed attorney who graduated from law school in 2000, she had the requisite legal 
and financial knowledge and financial resources to resolve more of her SOR debts. She 
did not establish her inability to resolve more of her SOR debts especially those debts 
less than $200; however, she chose not to aggressively seek resolution of more of her 
SOR debts. She did not prove that she negotiated in good faith to resolve the debt owed

to the company that constructed the debt on her residence. While circumstances 
beyond her control damaged her finances, she did not show enough progress paying or 
resolving her delinquent debts to mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Applicant did not provide enough specifics about how circumstances beyond her 
control adversely affected her finances; she did not establish that she acted responsibly 
to address her delinquent debts; she did not show how she reduced her expenses to 
conform with reductions in income; while she cited reasons why she could have 
disputed debts, she did not provide correspondence with creditors reasonably disputing  
or offering to settle the unmitigated SOR debts; and she did not receive financial 
counseling. Her failure to make greater progress resolving her SOR debts shows a lack 
of financial responsibility and judgment and raises unmitigated questions about 
Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See 
AG ¶ 18. More documented financial progress is necessary to mitigate financial 
considerations security concerns.  
  
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to 
Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a 
determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for 
award of a security clearance in the future. With more effort towards documented 
resolution of her past-due debts, and a track record of behavior consistent with her 
obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security 
clearance worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. I conclude that personal conduct security concerns are mitigated; however, 
financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated.   
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraph 1.a:     For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.e through 1.k:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.l:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.m through 1.n:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.o.:    For Applicant

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
