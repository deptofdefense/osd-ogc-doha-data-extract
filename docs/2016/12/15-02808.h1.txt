RIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s evidence is insufficient to mitigate the financial considerations 
concerns raised by his eight delinquent debts totaling $57,402, and his failure to timely 
file his tax returns. He failed to establish a track record of financial responsibility. Access 
to classified information is denied.      
  
History of the Case 
  
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 30, 2014. After 
reviewing it and the information gathered during a background investigation, the 
Department of Defense (DOD) was unable to make an affirmative decision to grant 
Applicant eligibility for a clearance. On October 26, 2015, the DOD issued Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations).1 Applicant answered the SOR on November 30, 2015 (Answer), and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA). 
 
                                            
1 The DOD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), implemented by the DOD on September 
1, 2006.

The case was assigned to me on April 13, 2016. DOHA issued a notice of hearing 
on April 21, 2016, scheduling the hearing for May 23, 2016. Applicant’s hearing was held 
as scheduled; however, Applicant requested and received a delay because he was not 
prepared for his hearing and was considering hiring counsel. On May 24, 2016, DOHA 
issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for June 22, 2016. The hearing was held 
as scheduled. Government exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, and Applicant’s exhibits (AE) 1 
through 6 were admitted into evidence without objection. On June 1, 2016, DOHA 
received the transcript of the first hearing, and on June 30, 2016, DOHA received the 
transcript of the second hearing. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 
1.h; he denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.i; and he partially admitted the allegation in SOR 
¶ 1.j. He also provided extenuating and mitigating information, and disputed the total debt 
owed on some of his delinquent accounts. Applicant’s admissions are hereby 
incorporated into my findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 56 years old, and he has worked as a security supervisor for a federal 
contractor since 2014. Applicant married in 1999 and divorced in 2005. His daughter is 
29 years old, and his son is 30 years old. Applicant graduated from high school in 1978, 
and he has taken a few college classes through the years.  
 
Between 1987 and 2007, Applicant worked as a postal clerk for the U.S. Navy. He 
held a security clearance during that period. He also believes he held a security clearance 
around 1977, when he worked in the mailroom for another federal agency. In 2004, 
Applicant started to work part-time as a security officer. In 2005, while employed as a 
Navy postal clerk, Applicant was injured in a vehicle accident. He testified that the Navy 
could not accommodate him on a “light duty” position, stopped paying him in 2006, and 
he was let go in 2007. Applicant averred this was the start of his financial problems. 
Afterwards, he was unable to continue making payments to the IRS and other creditors, 
and he never recovered his financial footing.  
 
After leaving his postal clerk job, Applicant worked, initially part-time and then full-
time, as a security officer from 2007 until 2009, when he resigned his security job. 
Applicant was unemployed between 2009 and 2011. For about two years, he worked 
security part time at a mall. In 2011, he resumed working full time in security, and in 2014, 
he started working full time for two security companies, including his current employer.  
 
In response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2014 SCA, Applicant disclosed 
that during the last seven years he had financial problems including his failure to file and 
pay his state taxes for tax years 2010, 2011, and 2013. He also claimed that before 2007, 
both he and his wife claimed their children as dependents, which caused him to acquire 
a debt with his state and the IRS. He further claimed he was making payments to the IRS, 
and when he lost his job he had to stop making payments. He also averred that in 2013, 
his employer took taxes for the wrong state which caused him a deficiency. Applicant 
 
3 
                                         
 
stated he was seeking financial counseling and considering retaining a lawyer to file for 
bankruptcy protection.  
 
Additionally, Applicant disclosed he had other judgments filed against him; that he 
owed money to the federal Government and had been paying through a deduction of 
wages since 2011; and that he had many other delinquent accounts.  
 
Applicant’s security investigation addressed his financial problems and revealed 
the SOR debts, which include nine delinquent debts totaling $57,402, comprised of 
unpaid judgments, tax liens, accounts in collection, and unfiled income tax returns. 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his SOR 
response, his testimony, and the record evidence. The status of his SOR debts is as 
follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a judgment filed in 2011 against Applicant by an apartment 
complex for $2,046. Applicant admitted he owed a debt to the creditor; however, he 
believed it was for a lesser amount. He said he was going to “fight” the debt; however, he 
did not provide details. He did not pay the debt.  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d allege a state tax lien filed in 2007 for $14,506 and a state tax 
lien filed in 2004 for $5,157. Applicant said the debts were caused by his failure to declare 
the income from his part-time employment for a state tax entity (M); however, he also 
stated that taxes were being withheld for another state-level tax authority (W) for a few 
years. Applicant said state M’s tax liens relate to back taxes owed for tax years 2004 
through 2007; however, the 2007 tax lien was most likely from tax year 2004, and the 
2004 tax lien was probably for an earlier year. Applicant has not contacted the state tax 
authority or paid anything toward the debts. (Tr. 42, 44) His SCA shows he lived in state 
M from March 2002 to April 2013, and then he moved to tax jurisdiction W. (SCA)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a federal tax lien filed in 2007 for $15,803. Applicant said he 
was making payments on it until he lost his Navy postal employment in 2007. He thought 
this federal tax lien might be for tax years 2004 through 2007. He has not contacted the 
IRS about paying this debt. (Tr. 43, 44)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a state debt placed for collection for $9,260. Applicant admitted 
the debt and said it originated in 2004. (SOR response) Applicant did not remember the 
basis of the debt; however, he was certain that he had not made any payments to address 
it. (Tr. 45)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges an apartment lease-related debt placed for collection for $8,880. 
Applicant admitted a debt owed to the creditor; however, he said the amount of the debt 
was incorrect. Applicant said he “went to court with them a couple of times;” however 
“they never considered the payments being made.” He said the debt was “a false debt,” 
and he did not pay the debt. (Tr. 46-47)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a credit union debt placed for collection for $954. Applicant 
admitted responsibility for the debt, and he claimed payments were being made when he 
 
4 
                                         
 
worked for Navy postal until 2007. He has not contacted the creditor or made payments 
since 2007. (Tr. 47) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $707. 
Applicant admitted he breached his contract; however, he disputed his responsibility for 
the debt. He said the creditor attempted to overcharge him; he refused to pay the charges; 
and he informed the creditor over the telephone that he disputed the debt. He did not 
have documentary evidence that he disputed the debt. (Tr. 48-50) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges a debt placed for collection for $89. Applicant did not recognize 
this debt. Applicant’s July 11, 2014 credit report indicates a medical debt originating in 
2012; a balance owed of $89 as of October 2012; and the debt is assigned to a collection 
agent. (GE 2 at 7) Applicant’s June 3, 2015 credit report shows an $89 medical debt; the 
account was opened in 2012; and there is no past due amount indicated. (GE 3 at 2) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.j alleges Applicant failed to file his state (M) tax returns for 2010, 2011, 
and 2013. Applicant admitted he did not file his 2010 and 2011 tax returns; however, he 
did not admit that he failed to file his 2013 state tax return. He said he did not file his state 
tax returns because he needed to get evidence that he paid taxes to another state-level 
jurisdiction (W). Applicant said he did not file a state tax return for 2009, and he did not 
remember whether he filed a state tax return for 2008 or 2014. (Tr. 51)  
 
Applicant considered filing for bankruptcy;2 however, he elected not to do so. He 
has not had financial counseling. After he completes financial counseling, he intends to 
consolidate his debts. He intends to pay his debts and resolve his tax issues.  
 
The SOR does not allege Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax 
returns, or that he failed to timely pay his federal income taxes.3 The following table 
summarizes the federal income tax filing dates and the refund or amount owed: 
 
                                            
2 On May 21, 2016, Applicant’s bankruptcy attorney wrote that Applicant retained him to file for 
bankruptcy. (AE 7) 
 
3 Applicant’s SOR does not allege that he did not timely file his federal tax returns for tax years 
2009 through 2011, and 2013. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board 
listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.

Consideration of his failure to timely file federal income tax returns will not be considered except for the five 
purposes listed above.

 When asked why he failed to timely file his income tax returns Applicant testified 
he did not have any good excuse to justify it. 
 
 Applicant’s annual pay from his day security employment is about $37,000, and 
his annual pay from his night security employment is about $24,000. Applicant’s monthly 
remainder after paying his debts and expenses is about $600 to $1,000. In October 2015, 
Applicant purchased a used 2014 Jeep Wrangler. He does not own any real estate, 
investments, or a retirement account, and he does not have any funds in his savings 
account. (Tr. 34-36) Applicant said he was unaware of his delinquent debts until he 
received a credit report in 2014. He denied that he received notices that he was late on 
his taxes or failed to file tax returns.  
 
The chief of operations for Applicant’s employer said Applicant has been an 
exemplary employer since January 2014. There is “no indication that [Applicant] lacks 
sound judgment or decision making abilities.” (AE 6)   
 
Policies 
 
Eligibility for access to classified information may be granted “only upon a finding 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The 
U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no one 
has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 
(1988). 
 
The AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person’s 
suitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition 
is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case can be 
                                            
 
4 The federal income tax returns Applicant provided for tax years 2009, 2010, and 2011 did not 
include Applicant’s social security number. (AE 1, 2, 3) The Internal Revenue Service usually rejects tax 
returns filed without social security numbers. It is unclear whether Applicant had W-2 forms to send to the 
IRS to document his income.  
 
 
6 
                                         
 
measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified 
information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration 
of the whole person and the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a). All available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must be considered.  
 
Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s security clearance. The Government 
must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the 
burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The 
applicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  
 
Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with 
the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling 
interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The “clearly 
consistent with the national interest” standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt 
about an applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the Government. “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. 
at 531; AG ¶ 2(b). Clearance decisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned. They are merely an indication that the applicant has or has not met 
the strict guidelines the Government has established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his SOR 
response, his testimony, and the record evidence. AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying 
conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) 
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial 
obligations;” and “(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required.” The record established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 
19(g) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
 
7 
                                         
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
  
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;5 and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
                                            
5 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
No mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant presented some important 
positive financial information. Because of his divorce in 2005, underemployment for 
several years, a car accident in 2005, and lack of income, he was unable to make some 
payments and keep some debts current. In May 2016, Applicant filed his federal tax 
returns for 2009 through 2011, 2013, and 2015. He acknowledged his delinquent debts, 
and he intends to pay his debts. I have credited Applicant with mitigating the $89 medical 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.i. Applicant denied responsibility for this debt, and his latest credit report 
does not indicate a balance owed for this debt.   
 
The negative financial considerations concerns are more substantial. The record 
established that Applicant has eight delinquent SOR debts totaling over $57,300, 
including two delinquent state tax liens and one federal income tax lien; he failed to timely 
file his state tax returns for 2010, 2011, and 2013; and he failed to timely file his federal 
income tax returns for 2009 through 2011, and for 2013. He did not explain how he was 
able to file his state tax returns for any years when he had not filed his federal income tax 
returns.  
 
Applicant presented no documentary evidence to show that he has been in contact 
with his creditors, or that he has attempted to settle, pay, or otherwise resolve his 
delinquent debts since they became delinquent or at least since 2007. Applicant’s 
explanations and evidence fail to establish that he has a track record of financial 
responsibility. Moreover, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case 
No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 
at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)). ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. 
Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an 
“[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the applicant’s] federal tax problem, 
and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such problems in 
 
9 
                                         
 
the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant’s security 
worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing 
irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. 
See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) 
(characterizing “no harm, no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of 
conduct and employed an “all’s well that ends well” analysis as inadequate 
to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing 
of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
In ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant 
disqualifying facts:  
 
Applicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and 
received a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in 
September 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He 
received Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. 
 
Notwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed in ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. 
Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board provided the following principal rationale for 
reversal: 
 
Failure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an 
applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government rules 
and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is 
essential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his 
2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, 
Applicant did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and 
reliability required of persons granted access to classified information.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the 
facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person concept. AG 
¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, 
but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is 56 years old. He worked for the Navy as a postal clerk, has worked as 
a security officer since 2004, and has been a security supervisor for his current employer 
since 2014. From at least 1987 to 2005, he held a security clearance when he was 
working as a Navy postal clerk, and possibly from 1977 when he worked in the mailroom 
for another federal agency. There is no evidence of security violations. 
 
Several circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his finances, 
including injury in a vehicle accident in 2005, divorce in 2005, and underemployment for 
 
10 
                                         
 
several years. The chief of operations for Applicant’s employer described Applicant as an 
exemplary employee.    
 
Notwithstanding, Applicant’s evidence is insufficient to establish his financial 
responsibility under the circumstances. He presented no documentary evidence to show 
that he has been in contact with his creditors, or that he has attempted to settle, pay, or 
otherwise resolve his delinquent debts since they became delinquent or at least since 
2007. He presented no documentary evidence of any payments to his creditors. 
Applicant’s explanations and evidence fail to establish that he has a track record of 
financial responsibility. 
 
Moreover, he has two delinquent state tax liens and one federal tax lien; he failed 
to timely file his state tax returns for 2010, 2011, and 2013; and he failed to timely file his 
federal income tax returns for 2009 through 2011, and 2013. When a tax issue is involved, 
an administrative judge is required to consider how long an applicant waits to file their tax 
returns, whether the IRS generates the tax returns, and how long the applicant waits after 
a tax debt arises to begin and complete making payments.6 Applicant waited several 
years (until May 2016) to file all required federal tax returns; he has not filed some state 
tax returns; and he continues to owe substantial state and federal tax debts from before 
2008.    
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations 
                                            
6 The recent emphasis of the Appeal Board on security concerns arising from tax cases is 
instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance 
and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only 
after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated 
himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone 
entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing 
grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant’s 
control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant’s 
wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 
(App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and 
insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and 
cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns 
for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except 
for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income 
of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical 
problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first 
place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and 
systems is essential for protecting classified information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). See also ISCR Case No. 14-
03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the 
federal government, and stating “A security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government 
for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has 
a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.”).

concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not 
warranted at this time. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:   Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraph 1.i:    For Applicant 
 
Subparagraph 1.j:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
