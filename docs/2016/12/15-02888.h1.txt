Decision
______________
METZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:
Based on the record in this case,  Applicant’s clearance is denied.1
On 26 October 2015, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial
Considerations.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the2
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 11
April 2016 and I convened a hearing 19 May 2016. DOHA received the transcript 1 June
2016.

Findings of Fact
Applicant admitted SOR financial allegations 1.a-1.f, but denied the remaining
allegations. He is a 57-year-old deputy program manager employed by a U.S. defense
contractor since April 2014. He held a clearance from September 1977, when he
entered a U.S. military academy, to February 1989, when he completed his active duty
service obligation. He has not previously held an industrial clearance. 
The SOR alleges, and the Government’s evidence (GE 1-4) documents, that
Applicant failed to file his Federal and state tax returns for tax years 2008-2012, and
that the tax returns remained unfiled at the time of the SOR. The SOR also alleges, and
Government exhibits establish, 12 delinquent debts totaling nearly $8,800.
Applicant’s May 2014 clearance application (GE 3) reported several delinquent
debts, including what he described as “various” debts totaling $8,500. He also noted
that he had not yet filed his Federal and state taxes for 2008-2012. He stated that he
was in the process of filing the delinquent returns and negotiating a settlement of his
outstanding tax liability. 
Applicant filed his delinquent Federal income tax returns in December 2015 and
his state income tax returns in May 2016 (AE A). In April 2016, he made three payments
to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 2008-2010 (AE B). Applicant stated
in his Answer that he was not required to file Federal or state income tax returns for
2011 and 2012. That may be true for tax year 2012, as he reported no income, but may
not be true for tax year 2011, for which he had reportable income. He claims, without
corroboration, to have entered into a repayment plan with the IRS to pay $700 monthly
for the next five or six years, beginning in June 2016 (Tr. 48).
Applicant paid SOR debt 1.q in February 2013. He paid SOR debts 1.r-1.v in
June 2014 (AE C). He claims to have paid $7,000-10,000 between 2013 and 2015 to
resolve debts which were not alleged in the SOR (Tr. 54). He paid SOR debt 1.k in
November 2015 (Tr. 52), along with SOR debts 1.l and 1.o (AE C). He paid SOR debt
1.p in December 2015 (AE C). He paid SOR debt 1.m in March 2016 and SOR debt 1.n
in May 2016 (AE C).
Applicant traces his financial problems to his 2008-2010 divorce proceedings and
his five years’ unemployment from December 2008 to April 2013. In December 2008, he
lost his job of nearly 20 years when his company relocated to another state and he was
unable to make the transfer. At the same time, Applicant and his wife separated, and
ultimately divorced in January 2010. Applicant received a small severance package
from his employer and used his retirement account to pay his living expenses. Applicant
did not provide any evidence of the steps he took to obtain new employment. His
clearance application listed employment from November 2009 to April 2013 as program
manager for a start-up company that never got off the ground. He received no income
from this job.
See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).3

When Applicant was married, his father-in-law prepared Applicant’s joint tax
return with his wife. For tax year 2008, Applicant anticipated that his father-in-law would
file for an extension, and that questions related to tax filings for that year would be
addressed in the marital settlement agreement (Tr. 39). In January 2010, Applicant
learned that his 2008 and 2009 taxes were not being filed (Tr. 40). He consulted a tax
accountant in early 2013, but took no concrete action (Tr. 41). He used commercial tax
software to prepare the estimated tax liabilities he reported on his May 2014 clearance
application (Tr. 43). He finally hired a tax accountant to file his delinquent taxes in
October 2015 (Tr. 44).
Applicant’s ex-wife, his current cohabitant (although not identified as such), and a
former supervisor and military academy classmate all consider him honest and
trustworthy, and recommend him for his clearance (AE E). He provided no budget or
evidence of any financial or credit counseling.
Policies
The adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person’s suitability
for access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and
mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.
Each decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the
factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,
conclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case
can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to
classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,
the relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).
Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s security clearance. The Government
must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,
the burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s case.
Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden
of persuasion.
Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a
compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,
reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.
The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard compels resolution of any
reasonable doubt about an applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the Government.3
¶19(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of4
the same;
¶19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; ¶19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;5
Because Applicant did not separately identify the “various” debts totaling $8,500 that he listed on his6
clearance application, and the record contains no evidence of a subject interview concerning his debts, I
cannot draw a direct correlation between what Applicant disclosed on his clearance application and the SOR
debts. However, the SOR debt allegations are based on the May 2014 credit report (GE 4) most recent in time
to Applicant’s clearance application, and total only about $300 more than what Applicant reported on his
clearance application.

Analysis
The Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant failed to timely file his state
and federal income tax returns from 2008 to 2012, a period of five years.  He filed his4
delinquent federal income tax returns in December 2015, and filed his delinquent state
income tax returns in May 2016, both dates after he received the SOR. Further, he had
nearly $8,800 in delinquent debts.  He paid one debt before he completed his clearance5
application (SOR 1.q) and five others he paid in June 2014, just after he completed his
clearance application (SOR 1.r-1.v). These six debts I resolve for Applicant. However,
the remaining six debts (SOR 1.k-1.p) were not paid until after Applicant received the
SOR.6
The Appeal Board has long held that failure to timely file required tax returns may
demonstrate a lack of judgment inconsistent with access to classified information.
A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal
obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good
judgment and reliability required of persons granted access
to classified information. Indeed, the Board has previously
noted that a person who has a history of not fulfilling their
legal obligation to file income tax returns may be said not to
have demonstrated the high degree of judgment and
reliability required for access to classified information.”7
This is true whether the failure to file is willful  or attributed to the press of family8
circumstances.  As recently as December 2015, the Appeal Board upheld a denial of9
clearance, in a case notably similar to this, of an applicant who had failed to file Federal
or state income tax returns for 10 years. 
The cases cited by Applicant’s post-hearing brief all involve cases where the failures to timely file occurred10
over three-four years, and none of them has been identified as an Appeal Board case.
¶20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that11
it is  unlikely to recur . . .

The filing of tax returns is both a financial and a legal
obligation. Applicant’s . . . failure to have done so for many
years is sufficient to raise a concern that he may be unwilling
to follow other rules and regulations, such as those that
govern the handling of classified information. See, e.g.,
ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (A
person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal
obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good
judgment and reliability required of those granted access to
classified information). See also Cafeteria & Restaurant
Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183
(D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Indeed, as the
Judge noted, Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 19(g) explicitly
provides that failure to file tax returns is a circumstance that
can raise a security concern. Moreover, the Directive
presumes a nexus between admitted or proven conduct
under any of the Guidelines and an applicant’s eligibility for a
clearance. See. e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04648 at 3 (App.
Bd. Sep. 9, 2015). ISCR Case No. 14-02930 at 3 (App. Bd.
Dec. 9, 2015)10
Security concerns under Guideline F are not limited to cases in which an
Applicant is financially insolvent or is experiencing difficulty in paying debts; although in
this case Applicant also became delinquent on his credit accounts. Applicant reported
his 2008-2012 tax filing issues on his May 2014 clearance application. There is no
evidence he was ever interviewed about them. Nevertheless, he stated that he was in
the process of addressing his taxes. Yet, it was another 18 months before his Federal
taxes were filed, and two years before his state taxes were filed. Not until October 2015
had he hired a tax accountant to address his delinquent taxes.
 
None of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations apply. Applicant’s
financial problems are both recent and not infrequent; to the extent that his financial
problems were due to his divorce and his unemployment, the immediate causes of his
problems may be unlikely to recur.   However, while his divorce and his unemployment11
were certainly beyond his control, he was not responsible in addressing his financial
problems. First, there is no evidence of his efforts to obtain employment during the five
years he was unemployed. Second, he was aware that his 2008-2009 tax returns had
¶20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control . . . and12
the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
¶20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that13
the problem is being resolved or is under control;
The fact that the IRS may not yet have taken action on Applicant’s lately-filed taxes can only be attributed14
to Applicant’s ongoing delays in filing his taxes.
¶20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.15

not been filed by the time of his January 2010 divorce. Yet he took no action to get them
filed for nearly six years, and for more than two years after he became re-employed.12
 
Applicant has apparently had no credit or financial counseling, but his taxes have
been filed, and the SOR debts paid, albeit half of them only after he received the SOR.13
Applicant has stated what he thinks his current tax situation is, but there is no evidence
of the IRS’s view of his taxes.  Applicant’s tardy filing of his taxes cannot be considered14
a good-faith effort to address his taxes;  nor can his late November 2015 and beyond15
payments of SOR debts. Moreover, Applicant has mostly disregarded these tax
obligations since April 2013, when he became re-employed. He moved with more
alacrity on his delinquent debt but still did not document any debt payments between
June 2014, when he had paid half the SOR debts, and October 2015, when he started
paying the other half. His documented inaction for over two years raises significant
security concerns that Applicant had not addressed by the flurry of activity triggered by
his receipt of the SOR. And that flurry of activity fails to mitigate Applicant’s overall
course of conduct, as it cannot overcome my conclusion that Applicant’s track record of
at least five years of procrastination on his taxes and his extensive delay in addressing
his delinquent debts makes it too soon to conclude that his security-significant conduct
is behind him. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.

Conclusion
Under the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant. Clearance denied.
