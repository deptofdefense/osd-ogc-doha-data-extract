DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). Clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 10, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing 
security concerns under Guideline F. This action was taken under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
 
2 
 
 
Applicant’s security clearance. On October 2, 2015, Applicant answered the SOR and 
requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on January 7, 2016. DOHA issued a 
notice of hearing on February 1, 2016, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on 
February 23, 2016.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (Gx) 1 through 
5. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (Ax) A through H. The record of 
the proceeding was left open until March 23, 2016, to provide Applicant the opportunity 
to submit additional matters. Applicant timely submitted documents that have been 
marked as Ax I through Q. All exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. 
DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 2, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Background Information. Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense 
contractor. He has been working for his current employer since March 2012. He 
graduated from high school in 1981 and earned a bachelor’s degree in 1989 and a 
master’s degree in 2001. He has completed the credits required for a doctorate degree. 
He served in the U.S. Army from 1989 to 2010 and retired honorably in the grade of 
lieutenant colonel (O-5). He is married and has two children, ages 23 and 26. He has 
held a security clearance for about 25 years.1 
 
Allegations and Applicant’s Response. The SOR alleged that Applicant had eight 
delinquent debts totaling $107,779, including a delinquent mortgage loan. In his Answer 
to the SOR, Applicant neither admitted nor denied the allegations, but provided 
comments on each allegation.2  
 
Reasons for Financial Problems. Applicant attributed his financial problems to 
various conditions beyond his control.  
 
First, as Applicant was planning for retirement from the Army in 2010, he 
received a verbal job offer for a leadership position at a college. He expected that his 
income in this new position along with his military retirement pay would keep him at his 
active duty income level. In moving to another state, however, his wife would at least 
temporarily lose her income as teacher. Based on the job offer, he moved to the new 
location. Due to a decrease in enrollment, however, the school reneged on the job offer. 
Applicant continued negotiations with the school, worked there on a 90-day contract, 
and later received a job offer that he considered unacceptable. This resulted in him 
being unemployed from November 2010 to February 2011 and from July 2011 to 
August 2011. He worked at a temporary job from August 2011 to March 2012 before

starting his current job. During these periods of unemployment or underemployment, he 
exhausted his savings and a retirement fund.3    
 
Applicant also indicated that his daughter was a victim of an assault in about 
2010 while attending college and was diagnosed with a mental health disorder. She 
received counseling for the assault and was institutionalized for a short period. She 
moved back home twice to continue with her treatments. Applicant paid her medical 
expenses that TRICARE did not cover. She returned to school for a period and is now 
fully employed.4  
 
Applicant further stated that his mother and stepfather were elderly. His 
stepfather was diagnosed with dementia in 2012. He also has Parkinson’s disease. 
Applicant and his siblings have assisted their parents financially. His stepfather has 
been residing in a nursing home since late 2014. Applicant also noted that he had two 
children in college until 2014 and incurred a $1,500 car repair bill in December 2015.5 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a – student loan past due in the amount of $1,420. A credit report dated 
August 24, 2015, reflected this debt had a balance of $30,175 and a date of last 
payment of March 2015. Applicant testified this was his daughter’s student loan, and it 
was now current. In his post-hearing submission, he provided a credit report dated 
January 25, 2016, that reflected this debt was no longer past due.6 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b – charged-off account in the amount of $31,126. This is a credit card 
account that had a date of last activity of August 2011. Applicant testified that he 
established a repayment plan for this debt in which he has been paying $200 per month 
since about March 2013. At the hearing, he submitted a document dated January 18, 
2016, from the creditor showing the balance of this debt had been reduced to $23,826. 
This debt is being resolved.7 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c – mortgage over 180 days past due in the amount of $72,053 with a 
total balance of $348,887. In 2005, Applicant purchased a home for $495,000. His 
monthly mortgage payments were $3,800. In July 2010, he attempted to sell the home 
as he was preparing to retire and move to another state. He was not successful in 
selling the home. He began renting a home in the new state and continued to make the 
mortgage payments on his unoccupied home. The home remained on the market until 
March 2011, when it was rented for about $700 less than his mortgage payments. In

about August 2011, he refinanced the mortgage loan to reduce the monthly payments to 
$2,300. His renters moved out in March 2012. He continued working with the bank and 
a realtor to sell the home. With resources exhausted, he made the last mortgage 
payment in September 2013. The home was foreclosed and later sold at auction on 
December 2, 2015. The court documents regarding the sale are confusing. The auction 
affidavit reflected the home was purchased for $585,149 by a bank (the creditor) serving 
as trustee for a residential asset mortgage company. Other court documents reflect the 
home was sold to the same trustee for $283,078 on December 14, 2015. In his post-
hearing submission, he provided a credit report dated January 25, 2016, that reflected 
the mortgage had a balance and past-due amount of zero. After the hearing, Applicant 
also wrote to the creditor requesting information about the current status of the 
mortgage loan. The creditor responded by indicating the property was foreclosed and 
transferred to a real estate agent, but made no mention of the sales price or a mortgage 
loan deficiency. Based on this evidence, I find the creditor is not seeking to hold 
Applicant responsible for any mortgage loan deficiency that may have resulted from the 
sale of the home.8   
 
SOR ¶ 1.d – student loan past due in the amount of $2,179. A credit report dated 
January 13, 2015, reflected this student loan had a balance of $30,306 and a date of 
last activity of August 2014. Applicant testified that this debt was current. Two more 
recent credit reports in the record do not contain entries reporting this student loan, but 
list other student loans as current. I find this student loan is resolved.9 
 
SOR ¶¶  1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h – medical debts placed for collection in the 
amounts of $428, $58, $327, and $188, respectively. These collection accounts were 
opened in 2011 and 2012. Applicant testified that TRICARE should have covered these 
debts. He stated that he was working with TRICARE to resolve them. They are only 
reported on the credit report dated June 12, 2012. Three more recent credit reports in 
the record do not contain entries reporting these debts. I find these debts are resolved.10 
 
Financial Situation. Applicant’s annual salary is $72,000. His monthly income 
(military retirement pay and civilian salary) is $9,114. His monthly expenses are about 
$8,416, which leaves him a monthly remainder of about $700. Since 1995, he has 
owned another home. The mortgage on that home is reported as “pays as agreed” and 
has a balance of $27,460. Applicant rented this home in the past, but now resides in it. 
His most recent credit report listed six debts that were previously reported as past due 
                                                          
8 Tr. 28, 36, 43-61; Gx 3, 4; Ax G, L, M, P, Q. The credit report dated January 25, 2016, also 
contained conflicting entries about the mortgage. Two entries reflect that the mortgage had a balance of 
$348,887 and past-due amount of $102,101. It is possible the entries reflecting that balance and past-due 
amount may not account for the foreclosure sale of the property.

but are now reported as current or paid. Besides the debts discussed above, he has not 
incurred any new delinquent debts since obtaining his current job.11  
  
 Character Evidence  
 
 Applicant served on active duty in Iraq for about a year and in a high-visibility 
position in Washington, DC. Applicant’s military awards include the Bronze Star, 
Defense Meritorious Service Medal, four Meritorious Service Medals, three Army 
Commendation Medals, and other medals and ribbons. He received Officer Evaluation 
Reports that rated him as “best qualified.”12 
 
 Applicant presented a number of letters of reference that described him as a 
person of character and integrity. His performance evaluations for his current job reflect 
that he met or exceeded expectations in various rating categories. He was an Eagle 
Scout.13 
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, in reaching a decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and

endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 sets forth the security concern for financial considerations: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
7 
 
 
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  
 
 Applicant accumulated delinquent debts that he was unable or unwilling to pay 
for an extended period. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
 
  Four financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.  
 
 Applicant encountered conditions beyond his control that contributed to his 
financial problems. Since then, he has taken reasonable steps to resolve his delinquent 
debts. The evidence established that his financial problems are under control and are 
being resolved. Those problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a) through 20(d) apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
 
8 
 
 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       
My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in this whole-person analysis. 
Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some 
warrant additional comment. I considered Applicant’s military service and civilian work 
history. He presented sufficient evidence to show his financial problems are being 
resolved. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to his 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant mitigated the security 
concerns under the financial considerations guideline. 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive 
are:          
 
   Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   For Applicant  
 
    Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h: For Applicant 
        
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. 
Clearance is granted.
