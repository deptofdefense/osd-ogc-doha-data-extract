DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). Clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 14, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing 
security concerns under Guideline F. This action was taken under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant’s security clearance. On October 8, 2015, Applicant answered the SOR and 
requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on January 7, 2016. DOHA issued a 
 
2 
 
 
notice of hearing on February 1, 2016, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on 
February 23, 2016.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (Gx) 1 through 
4. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (Ax) A through F. The record of 
the proceeding was left open until March 8, 2016, to provide Applicant the opportunity to 
submit additional matters. Applicant timely submitted documents that have been marked 
as Ax G through K. All exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA 
received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 2, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
working for his current employer since June 2012. He graduated from high school in 
1979 and attended college without earning a degree. He served on active duty in the 
U.S. Navy for 20 years and retired honorably in the grade of petty officer first class (E-6) 
in 2000. He has been married five times. He married his current wife in March 2010. He 
has two children, ages 22 and 32. He was granted a security clearance in 1980.1 
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant had 20 delinquent debts totaling $51,977 (SOR 
¶¶ 1.a-1.g, 1.i-1.u); that he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2007, which was dismissed in 
2008 (SOR ¶ 1.h); that he failed to file his 2008 federal income tax return as required 
(SOR ¶ 1.v); that he failed to file his 2009 state income tax return as required (SOR ¶ 
1.w); and that he failed to pay his state income taxes for 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.x). In his 
Answer to the SOR (Ans.) Applicant admitted each allegation with explanations. His 
admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.2  
 
Applicant attributed his financial problems to periods of unemployment, medical 
problems, and a divorce. He was unemployed from September 2009 to December 2009 
and from September 2010 to October 2010. After a short period of employment at a 
home improvement store, he was unemployed again in December 2010 when he fell 
down the stairs at his home and broke his back. He was not eligible for workers’ or 
unemployment compensation because his injuries were incurred at home while he was 
in a probationary period at work. He underwent physical therapy and remained in 
recovery until he started his current job in June 2012. He first worked for his current 
employer on a sporadic basis and became a full-time employee at the end of 2013. 
Since then, he has moved to two different states for a new position and a promotion.3 
 
In early 2006, Applicant and his wife purchased a home for $546,000 before the 
housing-market collapse. Their monthly mortgage payments were $2,851. At that time,

his annual salary was about $85,000. His wife worked at a credit union and earned 
about $40,000 annually. However, she quit her job about three months after they 
purchased the home. He did not know why she quit her job. She did not pursue further 
employment. With the loss of her income, he struggled to make the mortgage 
payments. In 2007, they tried to sell the home, but were unsuccessful. The value of the 
home had dropped drastically. They also tried unsuccessfully to refinance the home. He 
filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in an attempt to force the restructuring of the loan. During 
the bankruptcy, he realized that he would not be able to save the home even if the loan 
was restructured. He concluded the best course of action was to have the bankruptcy 
dismissed and home foreclosed. By doing so, he believed the foreclosure would be on 
his credit report, but the bankruptcy would not be listed. He thought having only the 
foreclosure on his credit report would be more advantageous to him. The home was 
foreclosed. The mortgage loan no longer appears on his credit reports and is not 
alleged in the SOR. Ironically, the bankruptcy is still reported on his credit reports.4 
 
Applicant stopped making his mortgage payments around November 2008. He 
and his wife vacated the property in February 2009. At that point, they rented an 
apartment for about $850 per month. Two months later, his wife left him. They filed for 
divorce in September 2009. He went through an acrimonious divorce. Upon filing the 
divorce, he was required to pay $3,242 per month as temporary spousal support. At that 
time, he was also paying $804 per month in child support. To minimize expenses, he 
moved to another apartment that rented for about $600 per month. He indicated that his 
wife was responsible for some debts, but failed to pay them. Her creditors brought 
collection actions against him. In April 2010, their divorce was granted. He was required 
to continue paying spousal support. He moved to another state for a federal job 
opportunity, but that position was eliminated due to budgetary constraints. He then 
obtained a job at a home improvement store and shortly thereafter broke his back in the 
accident. In May 2011, the state court terminated the spousal support obligation. He 
testified that it has taken him a while for his financial situation to stabilize so the he 
could begin resolving his delinquent debts.5 
    
The following table sets forth the status of the alleged debts. 
 
SOR ¶ Amount Comments & Status Evidence 
1.a $6,630 Mobile trailer loan with a date of last activity of 
December 2009. Applicant claimed he owed $4,200 on 
the trailer when it was voluntarily repossessed during 
his divorce. He assumed it was then resold and was 
not informed of a loan deficiency. Upon learning of the 
negative credit report entry, he contacted the creditor in

an attempt to obtain information about whether the 
trailer was resold and, if so, for what amount. The 
creditor failed to respond to his requests for information 
and indicated they have no paperwork on the debt. He 
has disputed this debt. 
1.b $4,503 Vehicle loan with a date of last activity of December 
2010. This vehicle was voluntarily repossessed after 
Applicant broke his back and could not afford the 
payments. In about 2012, he contacted the creditor and 
was told the debt was charged off. It no longer appears 
on his most recent credit reports.

submission, he provided a bank statement indicating it 
contained a payment towards this debt, but an

Due to his pending separation and divorce, Applicant failed to file his 2008 
federal income tax return and 2009 state income tax return in a timely manner. He 
provided proof that he filed those delinquent income tax returns when he began working 
again. He testified that he does not owe the Federal Government any past-due taxes. 
He initially owed the state about $18,000 in past-due taxes. In 2013, he entered into a 
repayment plan with the state and began making regular monthly payments of about 
$105. He recently increased his monthly payments to $150. At the time of the hearing, 
the balance of his past-due state income taxes had been reduced to about $3,961. He 
testified that he has timely filed his federal and state income tax returns since 2009.6  
 
Applicant’s current financial situation is stable. His annual salary is $118,000. His 
annual military retirement pay is $16,000. His current wife does not work, but she 
receives $1,214 per month in disability pay. Their combined annual income is about 
$150,000. He testified that he has not incurred any new delinquent debts in the last two 
years.7 
 
Applicant presented a reference letter from a senior vice president that described 
him as an extremely valuable employee because of his commitment, honesty, 
trustworthiness, and hardworking nature.8 
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no

one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, in reaching a decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 sets forth the security concern for financial considerations: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;   
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required . . . .  
 
 Applicant accumulated delinquent debts that he was unable or unwilling to pay 
for an extended period. He failed to file his 2008 federal income tax return and 2009 
state income tax return as required. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) apply.  
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
 
9 
 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of 
actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant encountered conditions beyond his control that contributed to his 
financial problems. Most significantly, he was unemployed for about 18 months after he 
broke his back in late 2010. After returning to work, he filed his 2008 federal income tax 
return and 2009 state income tax return and began a repayment plan for his past-due 
state income taxes. He has consistently made payments under that repayment plan for 
a number of years and reduced his past-due state income taxes from about $18,000 to 
$4,000. He also paid 11 of the other delinquent debts, although most of those were paid 
after issuance of the SOR. He contacted five creditors and was advised that he did not 
owe anything further on those debts. They no longer appear on his credit report. He 
disputed two debts; one no longer appears on his credit report. One of the alleged debts 
is a duplicate of another. He claimed he made a payment on one debt, but the evidence 
does not support that claim. In general, he has shown that he is committed to resolving 
his delinquent debts. He is now financially stable. His financial problems are under 
control, are being resolved and do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a) through 20(e) apply in varying 
degrees.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       
 
10 
 
 
My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in this whole-person analysis. 
Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant 
additional comment. I considered all of the record evidence, including Applicant’s 
military service and his work history. From the evidence presented, he has shown that 
he is committed to resolving his delinquent debts.  
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to his 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant mitigated the security concern 
under the financial considerations guideline. 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive 
are:          
 
    Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    For Applicant  
 
   Subparagraphs 1.a-1.x:  For Applicant 
    
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. 
Clearance is granted.
