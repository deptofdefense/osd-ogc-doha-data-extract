LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 26, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on June 9, 2015, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 6, 2016. The 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on January 
13, 2016, scheduling the hearing for February 4, 2016. The hearing was convened as 
scheduled. A letter from Department Counsel to Applicant was marked Hearing Exhibit 
 
2 
 
(HE) I. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. 
Applicant questioned the accuracy of an entry on GE 3, but he did not object to its 
admissibility, and it was admitted. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibit 
(AE) 1 through 20, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing 
transcript (Tr.) on February 12, 2016.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his current employer since 2008. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1985 
until he retired in 2009. He seeks to retain a security clearance. He attended college for 
a period, but he did not earn a degree. He is married for the second time, but he and his 
wife are separated. He has three children and a stepchild.1 
 
 Applicant did not file federal income tax returns when they were due for tax years 
2002 through 2006 and 2008 through 2011. He stated that he received bad advice from 
other noncommissioned officers, but he also admitted that he knew better. He was 
serving overseas during several of the years the returns went unfiled.2 
 
 The IRS filed substitute tax returns for tax years 2002 and 2004 through 2006. 
Applicant filed his 2007 federal income return on time. He filed his 2002 tax return in 
February 2008. He filed his 2004 tax return in September 2007. He filed his 2005 and 
2006 returns in September 2008.3 
 
 In 2010, the IRS filed a $12,170 tax lien against Applicant for tax years 2002 and 
2004 through 2007. That amount included penalties and interest. In June 2012, 
Applicant’s employer received a notice from the IRS to levy Applicant’s wages, and 
informed Applicant that his wages would be garnished. The amount due was $14,135. 
Applicant contacted the IRS and started correcting his tax problems. He set up an 
installment plan to pay $500 every two weeks. The levy was released by the IRS in July 
2012.4 
 
 Applicant filed his 2008, 2009, and 2010 federal income tax returns in July 2012. 
He filed his 2011 tax return in August 2012. He filed his 2005 and 2006 returns in 
September 2008. He filed his 2012, 2013, and 2014 returns on time.5 
 
 Applicant consistently made the installment agreement payments, and the tax 
lien was released in October 2013. His back taxes were paid in November 2014. He

received a refund in December 2014. He no longer owes the IRS. His state certified that 
he is in good standing.6 
 
 Applicant’s accepts responsibility for his actions, and he is embarrassed by his 
poor judgment. He also realizes that, with penalties and interests, he paid more in taxes 
than if he had filed the returns on time. He credibly testified that he learned a hard 
lesson and the behavior will not be repeated. He has received financial counseling.7 
 
 Applicant made multiple deployments while he was on active duty to locations 
such as Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan. He received numerous awards, 
medals, and commendations. He submitted documents and letters attesting to his 
excellent performance in the military and on his job. He is praised for his loyalty, 
dedication, leadership, work ethic, responsibility, and integrity.8 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
                                                          
6 Tr. at 22-23; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2; AE 1, 6, 7, 14, 15. 
 
7 Tr. at 21-25, 32-34, 36; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. 
 
8 Tr. at 26-28; GE 1, 2; AE 4, 5, 9, 19, 20.

 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
 The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns 
under AG ¶ 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required or the fraudulent filing of the same. 
 
 Applicant did not file his federal income tax returns when they were due. AG ¶ 
19(g) is applicable.  
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; and 
 
 
5 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control.  
 
 Applicant’s pattern was to file his income tax returns late, if at all. The IRS finally 
got Applicant’s attention in 2012 with the notice to levy his wages. Applicant filed his late 
returns and instituted an installment agreement to pay his back taxes. His 2012, 2013, 
and 2014 returns were filed on time, and his back taxes were completely paid by 2014. 
He credibly testified that he learned a hard lesson, and the behavior will not be 
repeated. 
 
 Applicant’s financial problems are resolved. They occurred under circumstances 
that are unlikely to recur and no longer cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and 
good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(c) are applicable 
   
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  
 
I considered Applicant’s favorable character evidence and honorable military 
service, particularly his multiple deployments to combat zones. For years, Applicant did 
not demonstrate the high degree of judgment and reliability required for access to 
classified information. See e.g. ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). 
However, he learned his lesson and took remedial action years before the SOR was 
issued. 
 
 
6 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
