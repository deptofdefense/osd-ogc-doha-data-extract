GOLDSTEIN, Jennifer I., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant was alleged to be delinquent on two Federal income tax liens totaling 
$119,144; two state tax liens totaling $92,483; and 14 other debts in the total amount of 
$482,742. He resolved one delinquent mortgage debt; he paid one small debt in full; 
and one other debt was cancelled by the creditor. He failed to show he has taken 
responsible actions on his remaining financial obligations. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 25, 2014, Applicant submitted a signed Electronic Questionnaires 
for Investigations Processing (e-QIP.) On October 30, 2015, the Department of Defense 
(DoD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns 
under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive 
Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 
1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective September 1, 2006.

On December 2, 2015, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer), and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 19, 
2016. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing 
on January 21, 2016, scheduling the hearing for March 1, 2016. The hearing was 
convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which 
were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called one 
witness, and presented one exhibit, marked Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. Department 
Counsel had no objection to AE A, and it was admitted. The record was left open for 
receipt of additional documents until March 15, 2016. On March 16, 2016, Applicant 
submitted additional exhibits. They were marked AE B through AE J. Department 
Counsel had no objections to AE B through AE J, even though they were produced after 
the deadline, and they were admitted. The record then closed. DOHA received the 
transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 9, 2016.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is married and 
has two children, ages 14 and 10. He earned a doctorate degree in 1996. He has 
worked for his current employer since September 2015. (GE 1.) 
 
 As listed in the SOR, Applicant was alleged to be delinquent on two Federal 
income tax liens totaling $119,144 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b); two state tax liens totaling 
$92,483 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d); and 14 other debts in the total amount of $482,742 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.r). Applicant denied the delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
through 1.r. (Tr. 12.) His debts are identified in the credit reports entered into evidence. 
(GE 2; GE 3; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6.) After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, 
exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  
 
Applicant’s Federal and state tax liens resulted from an Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) audit that was performed on his 2011 individual income tax returns. He used a tax 
preparation company to do his taxes and believed that his deductions were appropriate 
when he filed them. However, the IRS found that Applicant and his wife did not qualify 
as real estate professionals. As a result, Applicant’s Federal and state income tax 
returns for 2009, 2010, and 2011 were recalculated, and Applicant was found liable for 
an undisclosed amount owed to both the state and Federal governments. A Federal tax 
lien in the amount of $70,091 was filed against Applicant in 2013. A second Federal tax 
lien was filed against Applicant in 2014, in the amount of $49,053. Two state tax liens 
were also filed against Applicant in 2013 and 2014, in the amounts of $49,053 and 
$43,430, respectively. (Tr. 29-49.) 
 
In 2011 Applicant’s income was $245,000 per year, not including stock options, 
and he had become accustomed to the life style which that salary afforded. Shortly after 
Applicant’s tax audit, he was terminated by his employer as a result of the employer 
closing the division in which Applicant worked. His income fell to $155,050 in 2012 and 
he lost his unvested stock options. He received a severance package that covered two 
years of medical benefits, plus “some months of salary.” (AE A; Tr. 64-67.) He was 
 
3 
 
unemployed until 2013. During his unemployment, he reported he applied for over 8,000 
jobs. He also started a small consulting firm to help pay his bills. (AE A; Tr. 56-75.) 
 
In March 2013 Applicant became fully employed by another company, but when 
that company downsized in June 2013, Applicant was terminated. Applicant was 
unemployed from June 2013 to October 2013. In October 2013 he was hired by a 
Government contractor, at a reduced income. In 2013 he earned $103,498. In 2014 his 
income rose to $179,785. He worked in that position until October 2015, when he was 
hired by his current employer. From 2014 to 2015 he also worked several part-time jobs 
to generate income. His 2015 income was reported to be $236,000. His wife is not 
employed outside their home. Applicant attributes his financial delinquencies to 
unemployment and under employment since losing his position in approximately 2012. 
(AE A; Tr. 70-79.) 
 
 Applicant’s tax preparer testified on his behalf. He explained that Applicant 
sought his services in 2013. Prior to that time, Applicant had established payment plans 
with both the IRS and the state tax authority. However, when they submitted an offer in 
compromise to the IRS, those payments were placed on hold. Applicant’s 2013 offer in 
compromise was rejected by the IRS, because the IRS wanted more documentation. A 
second offer in compromise, along with one payment of an undisclosed amount, was 
submitted in January 2015. The IRS reviewed it for six months, and then rejected it. A 
third offer was submitted in June or July of 2015, along with another payment of an 
undisclosed amount. It too was rejected. The IRS has assigned a revenue agent to 
Applicant’s case, and Applicant will either submit a new offer in compromise or set up a 
payment plan. His Federal tax liens are unresolved at this time. (Tr. 29-58, 114-115.) 
 
 Applicant claims he had been making payments of $1,500 per month to his state 
taxation authority toward resolution of the 2013 and 2014 tax liens. His tax preparer 
testified those payments apparently stopped in October 2015, when Applicant was hired 
by his new employer. Applicant failed to provide documentation to substantiate his 
claims of payments. These debts remain unresolved. (Tr. 36.) 
 
 Applicant was delinquent in the amount of $104,554 on a $535,318 mortgage, as 
stated in SOR ¶1.e. Applicant testified this debt was for a home he purchased in 2002. 
It was his primary residence until approximately 2012 or 2013, when he became 
unemployed. Applicant rents this house to tenants, but hopes to reoccupy it in the near 
future. He did not use the rental income to pay the mortgage. Instead, he used the 
rental income for living expenses and to satisfy other debts. Applicant applied for loan 
modifications on this property, but his applications were denied. However, he resolved 
the delinquency in full in June 2015. His February 29, 2016 credit report reflects this 
account as current, with $0 past due. Applicant is resolving this debt. (GE 6; AE D; AE I; 
Tr. 82-88.) 
 
 Applicant was delinquent in the amount of $3,115 on a $416,947 mortgage, as 
stated in SOR ¶1.f. Applicant’s February 29, 2016 credit report reflects this account as 
past due in the lesser amount of $1,673, which indicates Applicant has made some 
payments to this creditor. It has been delinquent since October 2015. Applicant claimed 
 
4 
 
to have a dispute with this creditor because it was making excessive escrow charges. 
However, he failed to produce evidence to support his claim or document regular 
payments. This debt is unresolved. (GE 6; Tr. 88-91.)  
 
 Applicant was delinquent in the amount of $72,636 on a $420,000 mortgage, as 
alleged in SOR ¶1.g. Applicant claims “this property has been in modification review for 
four years.” (Tr. 91.) Applicant’s February 29, 2016 credit report reflects this account as 
past due in the amount of $93,173. It has been delinquent since September 2013. It is 
unresolved. (GE 6; Tr. 91-94.) 
 
Applicant is delinquent on a charged off account in the amount of $205,478, as 
stated in SOR ¶1.h. Applicant’s February 29, 2016 credit report reflects this account as 
past due in the amount of $205,478. It first became delinquent in December 2012. 
Applicant presented documentation that shows he applied for a loan modification on this 
mortgage. A letter, dated December 1, 2015, from this creditor offered to settle this debt 
for $61,643. Applicant has not made a payment to this creditor despite the offer to settle 
the debt because he does not want to damage his negotiations with the IRS. (GE 6; AE 
G; AE J; Tr. 94-95.) 
 
Applicant is past due on a $52,206 home equity line of credit in the amount of 
$8,492, as stated in SOR ¶1.i. This debt became delinquent in October 2012. Applicant 
plans to restructure this debt but it is currently unresolved. (GE 6; Tr. 95-97.) 
 
Applicant is delinquent on a $21,642 charged-off debt, as stated in SOR ¶1.j. 
Applicant produced a letter from this creditor, dated August 2015, indicating this debt 
was forgiven by the creditor. It is resolved. (AE C; Tr. 97-98.) 
 
Applicant is delinquent on a $19,940 charged-off line of credit, as stated in SOR 
¶1.k. This debt became delinquent in August 2014. Applicant’s February 29, 2016 credit 
report reflects this account as past due in the amount of $19,918. While he claimed to 
have paid this debt through the services of a debt management company, he produced 
no evidence to support his claim. It is unresolved. (GE 6; Tr. 98.) 
 
Applicant is delinquent on a $17,274 charged-off debt, as stated in SOR ¶1.l. 
Applicant’s February 29, 2016 credit report reflects this account as charged off. It has 
been delinquent since August 2010. (GE 6.) 
 
Applicant is delinquent on a $13,857 charged-off debt, as stated in SOR ¶1.m. 
Applicant’s February 29, 2016 credit report reflects this account as “paid and closed” as 
of July 2015. It also shows that this creditor charged off $13,857 of this debt. This debt 
is resolved. (GE 6; Tr. 111-112.) 
 
Applicant is delinquent on a $12,940 charged-off credit card debt, as stated in 
SOR ¶1.n. Applicant’s February 29, 2016 credit report reflects this debt as delinquent 
since January 2014. Applicant claimed he is making $272 payments to this creditor on a 
monthly basis and that it will be resolved by next year. He failed to produce 
documentation to support his claim. (GE 6; Tr. 98-99, 112.) 
 
5 
 
Applicant is delinquent on a $1,625 charged-off debt, as stated in SOR ¶ 1.o. 
Applicant’s February 29, 2016 credit report reflects this account was placed for 
collections with a collection agency. Applicant claimed that this debt was being resolved 
through a debt management company. He failed to produce documentation to support 
his claim. It remains unresolved. (GE 6; Tr. 99, 112.) 
 
Applicant is delinquent on a $527 charged-off debt, as stated in SOR ¶ 1.p. 
Applicant claimed that this debt was being resolved through a debt management 
company. He failed to produce documentation to support his claim. It remains 
unresolved. (Tr. 99, 112.) 
 
Applicant is delinquent on a $134 charged-off debt, as stated in SOR ¶ 1.q. 
Applicant’s February 29, 2016 credit report reflects this account has been delinquent 
since April 2014. Applicant claimed that this debt was being resolved through a debt 
management company. He failed to produce documentation to support his claim. It 
remains unresolved. (GE 6; Tr. 99, 112.) 
 
Applicant is delinquent on a $528 charged-off debt, as stated in SOR ¶ 1.r. 
Applicant’s February 29, 2016 credit report reflects this account as “unpaid.” It has been 
delinquent since April 2014. Applicant claimed that this debt was being resolved through 
a debt management company. He failed to produce documentation to support his claim. 
It remains unresolved. (GE 6; Tr. 99, 112.) 
 
Applicant hired debt resolution firms twice to help him resolve his delinquencies. 
He hired the first firm in October 2012. The firm calculated Applicant’s assets at that 
time to equal $1,468,000. However, his total liabilities of $1,657,021 left him with a 
negative net worth of $189,021. He failed to show he made any payments to this debt 
resolution company. (AE F.) He hired a second debt management firm in May 2013 to 
resolve five consumer debts. However, Applicant’s documentation failed to show any 
payments were made under that plan. (AE B.) Additionally, Applicant presented 
documentation showing he has made attempts to resolve other accounts, but I was 
unable to match those account numbers with the debts alleged on the SOR. (AE E.) He 
intends to resolve his remaining debt with anticipated bonuses and stock options. (Tr. 
79.) 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and 
mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in AG ¶ 2 describing the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
 
6 
 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance 
decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18, as 
follows:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
7 
 
 
 AG ¶ 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may 
be disqualifying in this case:  
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(e) consistent spending beyond one’s means, which may be indicated by 
excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-
income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. 
 
 Applicant has a history of financial indebtedness documented by the credit 
reports, which substantiate all of the SOR allegations. He had a negative net worth as a 
result of overspending on real estate investments and relying on stock options that 
never vested. He lost his high-paying job in 2012, and found himself indebted to the IRS 
and his state tax authority. Additionally, he incurred substantial delinquencies to 14 
other creditors. He has done little to resolve the majority of his debts. The evidence 
raises security concerns under all three of these disqualifying conditions, thereby 
shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns.  
 
 The guideline includes five conditions in AG ¶ 20 that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from Applicant’s financial difficulties: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 
8 
 
 Applicant’s financial problems are ongoing. He has resolved or is resolving only 
three of the 18 allegations. Given his lack of effective action on the remaining debts, he 
has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely, despite his anticipated 
bonuses and stock options. Mitigation under AG ¶ 20(a) was not established. 
 
 Applicant blamed his financial problems on periods of unemployment and 
underemployment. While these are conditions beyond Applicant’s control, his financial 
problems are also due, in significant part, to his poor judgment including excessive 
spending and reliance on bonuses and stock options that were not guaranteed. He 
continues to make commitments for money which he has not yet received. Further, he 
failed to act responsibly under the circumstances, and did not address his debts in a 
timely manner. Mitigation under AG ¶ 20(b) was not fully established. 
 
 Applicant presented documentation and testimony that he has sought the help of 
two debt management firms and a tax professional. However, he failed to show clear 
indications that his financial problems are being resolved or are under control. Only 
three debts have been addressed in a meaningful manner. The rest, including two 
Federal income tax liens totaling $119,144 and two state tax liens totaling $92,483, 
remain unresolved. Mitigation under AG ¶¶ 20(c) nor 20(d) was not fully established. 
 
 Applicant provided no documented proof of any disputes with the SOR-listed 
creditors. AG ¶ 20(e) has not been established. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is a 
 
9 
 
mature adult and responsible for his choices and financial obligations. For over five 
years, he has not acted responsibly with respect to his finances. He was accustomed to 
a lavish lifestyle until 2012, and did not significantly reduce his debt or expenses when 
he lost his high-paying job. Further, when he was reemployed in a stable position, he 
did little to address his past delinquencies. Moreover, his credit reports show that 
despite earning $179,785 in 2014, several additional debts became past due that year. 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings

clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
