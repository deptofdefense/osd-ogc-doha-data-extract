DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 31, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing 
security concerns under Guideline F. This action was taken under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant’s security clearance. On November 17, 2015, Applicant answered the SOR 
and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on January 8, 2016. DOHA 
 
2 
 
 
issued a notice of hearing on February 1, 2016, and the hearing was convened as 
scheduled on February 23, 2016.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (Gx) 1 through 
7. Applicant testified, called one witness, and submitted Applicant Exhibit (Ax) A. The 
record of the proceeding was left open until March 8, 2016, to provide Applicant the 
opportunity to submit additional matters. Applicant timely submitted documents that 
have been marked as Ax B through E. All exhibits were admitted into evidence without 
objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 2, 2016. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 58-year-old owner of a company that is a federal contractor. He 
graduated from high school in 1975 and attended technical school without earning a 
degree. He has been married for almost 45 years and has three adult children. He has 
held a security clearance for about 30 years.1 
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcies in 1993, 1995, 
1998 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c) and that he had 12 delinquent debts totaling $793,921 (SOR ¶¶ 
1.d-1.o). In his Answer to the SOR (Ans.), Applicant admitted each allegation. His 
admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.2  
 
Applicant worked in a naval shipyard for years. At some point, shipyard 
employees were informed the shipyard would be closing. Applicant looked for other 
financial opportunities. He started a trucking business with his brother-in-law while he 
continued to work at the shipyard. He later learned that his brother-in-law was involved 
in drugs and was stealing from the trucking business. His brother-in-law’s 
mismanagement of the trucking business resulted in financial losses that prompted 
Applicant to file Chapter 13 bankruptcies.3  
 
In 1993, Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy with reported assets of $144,970 
and liabilities of $155,850. In 1994, this bankruptcy was dismissed. In 1995, he filed a 
second Chapter 13 bankruptcy with reported assets of $119,970 and liabilities of 
$134,609. In 1998, the second bankruptcy was dismissed. In 1998, he filed a third 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy with reported assets of $150,710 and liabilities of $136,744. The 
third bankruptcy resulted in a discharge of his debts in 2003. In 2005, he reported the 
bankruptcies on his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) and 
was granted a security clearance.4

3 Tr. 22, 28-29, 50-53; Gx 7. 
 
4 Tr. 49-53; Gx 4-6. The SOR incorrectly alleged that Applicant’s 1993 and 1995 Chapter 13 
bankruptcies resulted in discharges and that his 1998 Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed.

Since 1999, Applicant owned and operated a company. It is a Subchapter C 
corporation. His wife owns 51% of the company and he owns the remaining 49%. 
Because it is a small company, Applicant and his wife signed personally for lines of 
credit to operate the business.5 
 
In about 2009, Applicant’s company was awarded a contract on a large 
construction project. His company was one of many contractors involved in this project. 
The value of his company’s contract was over seven million dollars. His company spent 
about two years preparing for this project, which included purchasing a building with six 
acres of land, establishing lines of credit, and hiring over 100 employees. Applicant also 
expended about $300,000 of his personal funds in support of this contract. As the 
project proceeded, the company that owned the project was late on its payments to the 
contractors and, at one point, owed Applicant’s company three million dollars. These 
delays caused Applicant to miss payments on his financial obligations. The financial 
institution supporting Applicant’s company indicated it could not continue to provide his 
company funding if it did not receive its payments. Applicant was eventually caught in a 
bind between these companies. The contract provided that if Applicant’s company could 
not pay its bills then the owner had the right to cancel the contract. Construction delays 
occurred that were beyond Applicant’s control. The project ran over budget. Applicant’s 
company had completed about 75% of its work on the project when the owner canceled 
Applicant’s contract in early 2010. Applicant claimed the owner was responsible for the 
default because their late payments precluded him from meeting his financial 
commitments. Applicant’s company sued the owner. After about three years of litigation, 
a court ruled that Applicant’s company was responsible for its losses.6  
 
All of the alleged debts arose from the large construction project. The debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.g, which total over $86,000, are reflected in Applicant’s credit 
reports. These include judgments against Applicant for $43,945 (SOR ¶ 1.d) and $8,279 
(SOR ¶ 1.e). Applicant disclosed the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.h through 1.o in his latest e-
QIP, but they are not listed on his credit reports. He indicated that, while either his wife 
or his company was responsible for those debts, he disclosed them to be forthcoming 
and to ensure there was no misunderstanding.7 
 
Applicant did not provide any proof of payments or payment arrangements for the 
alleged debts. He testified that none of the debts were resolved, but he intended to pay 
them in the future. His company is still operating and is down to three employees. He 
hoped to obtain some shipyard contracts in the near future. Once his business becomes 
profitable again, he will pay the debts. He stated the creditors are aware of his situation 
and are working with him.8

Applicant’s wife works full-time for a school district. He submitted a personal 
financial statement that reflected their net monthly income was $3,328, their total 
monthly expenses were $1,588, their monthly debt payments were $1,378, which left 
them a net monthly remainder of $362. In June 2015, his company had a certificate of 
deposit in a financial institution totaling $23,772. In August 2015, his company received 
a purchase order from a major defense contractor for $500,000 of services and was 
pursuing bids on major defense contracts. His most recent credit report reflected seven 
debts in a past-due status totaling about $1,576 that were not alleged in the SOR. He 
also testified that he was behind on his mortgage payments.9  
 
Applicant is a well-respected businessman. He has received a number of awards 
for his business and other achievements. As part of the large construction contract 
discussed above, he hired over 100 employees in a rural area and assisted in obtaining 
a sewer system for the local community. His company has also hosted holiday events 
and outreach programs for local communities.10 
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, in reaching a decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
                                                          
9 Tr. 22-23, 29-32, 39-49, 59, 71-74, 85-87. Debts not alleged in the SOR will not be considered in 
applying the disqualifying conditions.

possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 sets forth the security concern for financial considerations: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 
6 
 
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  
 
 Applicant accumulated delinquent debts that he was unable to pay for an 
extended period. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of 
actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant encountered conditions beyond his control that contributed to his 
financial problems. Specifically, the owner of a construction project failed to make 
payments to Applicant’s company in a timely manner. Those delays caused Applicant to 
default on his financial obligations. Applicant sued the owner, but a court ruled against 
him. He indicated that he plans to pay the delinquent debts when he obtains future 
contracts. At this point, however, he has not taken any meaningful steps to resolve his 
financial problems.  
 
 Applicant’s credit reports only reflect four of the alleged debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.d 
through 1.g). The remaining debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.h through 1.o) were either his wife’s or his 
company’s debts. I find for Applicant on those remaining debts even though he listed 
them in his e-QIP and admitted responsibility for them in his Answer to the SOR. AG ¶ 
20(e) applies to SOR ¶¶ 1.h though 1.o. 
 
 
7 
 
 
 Applicant’s delinquent debts are ongoing and significant. He has a history of 
financial problems and had debts discharged in a bankruptcy in 2003. From the 
evidence presented, I am unable to find that his current delinquent debts are being 
resolved or that his financial problems are under control. Those problems continue to 
cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶ 20(b) partially 
applies. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       
My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in this whole-person analysis. 
Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant 
additional comment. Applicant is a hard-working and respected businessman. He stated 
that he intends to resolve his financial problems. However, a promise to pay in the future 
is not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a responsible manner. From the 
evidence presented, it is unclear when Applicant’s financial situation will permit him to 
resolve his delinquent debts. Despite the presence of some mitigation, financial security 
concerns remain in this case. 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to his 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the security 
concern under the financial considerations guideline. 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive 
are:          
 
 
 
8 
 
 
    Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    Against Applicant  
 
   Subparagraphs 1.a-1.g:  Against Applicant 
   Subparagraphs 1.h-1.o:  For Applicant 
 
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Clearance is denied.
