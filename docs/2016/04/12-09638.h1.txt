Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his eligibility for
access to classified information. He did not present sufficient documentary evidence to
mitigate the concern stemming from his failure to file state and federal individual income
tax returns for the period 2003–2013. Accordingly, this case is decided against
Applicant. 
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on March 9, 2012.  About three years later on January 20,1
2015, after reviewing the application and information gathered during a background
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD)  sent Applicant a statement of reasons2
(SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to3
a complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action under the security guideline known as
Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant answered the SOR on March 18,
2015.    
Neither Applicant nor Department Counsel requested a hearing, and so the case
will be decided on the written record.  On July 27, 2015, Department Counsel submitted4
all relevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing.  On November5
17, 2015, this file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant, who received it
on January 5, 2016. He replied within the 30-day period from receipt of the FORM. His
reply consists of a two-page handwritten memorandum with three attachments. Those
documents are made part of the record as Exhibit A. The case was assigned to me on
April 27, 2016.   
Procedural Matters 
The FORM includes Exhibit 4, which is a set of interrogatories answered by
Applicant in June 2014. It includes a report of investigation (ROI) summarizing
Applicant’s interview during the 2012 background investigation. The summary appears
to be properly authenticated via Applicant’s answers to the interrogatories as required
under ¶ E3.1.20 of the Directive. Accordingly, the summary and the remainder of Exhibit
4 are admissible. 
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 59-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance
for his job as a designer working in the shipbuilding industry. He has been so employed
since 2008. He has worked in the shipbuilding industry since at least 2001. His

educational background includes an associate’s degree awarded in 1978. He has been
married and divorced twice. He has two adult children. 
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file state and federal
individual income tax returns for tax years 2003–2013. In Section 26 of his security
clearance application, he disclosed failing to file state and federal returns for tax years
2004–2011.  Subsequently, he admitted failing to file returns for tax years 2003 to6
present during his May 2012 background investigation.  By way of explanation, he7
stated that he experienced difficulties and delays in working with his tax preparer, who
then passed away in 2009, and he was working to recover from that situation.
Applicant was asked to provide updated information about his tax problems in
2014, when the DOD issued written interrogatories to him.  He did not provide any8
documentation showing he had filed returns in response to the interrogatories. But he
made the following statements: (1) he had yet to file federal returns for tax years
2005–2013, but had, as of July 16, 2014, filed returns for tax years 2003 and 2004; (2)
he estimated owing the sum of about $13,000, plus interest, to the IRS for tax years
2005–2013; (3) he anticipated filing federal returns for tax years 2007–2010 within a few
weeks; (4) he had, as of July 16, 2014, filed state returns (in two different states) for all
tax years; and (5) he owed no back taxes to state tax authorities. 
In response to the FORM, Applicant provided documentation that he had paid
fees for filing overdue returns with the two state tax authorities.  First, the9
documentation shows that as of February 20, 2015, he owed $1,997.75 for a penalty or
fee for tax years 2010 and 2012 in State M.  Second, the documentation shows that in10
January 2016 he received State M income tax refunds of $721 and $621 for tax years
2010 and 2012, respectively.  Third, the documentation shows that in January 2016 he11
paid $200 ($50 per year) for a late filing penalty to State A for tax years 2003, 2004,
2005, and 2007.  Otherwise, he provided no other documentation concerning his state12
and federal returns. He further stated that now that he had paid the necessary late fees
to state tax authorities, he would be able to put forth all his effort on resolving his federal
tax issues.

Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As13
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt14
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An15
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  16
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting17
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An18
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate19
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme20
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.21
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.22
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
 Executive Order 10865, § 7.23
 AG ¶¶ 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 24
 ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that “the security suitability of an applicant25
is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness or recurring
financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In
security clearance cases, “the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances
surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation
omitted).

decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it23
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant24
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 25
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  26
The concern under Guideline F is broader than the possibility that a person might
knowingly compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of
value. It encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial
history within the meaning of Guideline F.  I reach that conclusion based on the27
findings of fact that show Applicant failed to file state and federal individual income tax
returns for tax years 2003–2013. For the state returns, he presented incomplete
 Exhibit A at Attachments 1, 2, and 3.28
 AG ¶ 20(a)–(f).29
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).30

documentation that suggests he filed returns for some of the tax years.  It follows28
logically that a taxpayer would not normally be assessed a late filing penalty or receive
a refund unless a return was filed. But he did not present the best evidence to prove
that he filed the returns and that he is now in compliance with state tax authorities. The
best evidence would include items such as (1) copies of the tax returns along with proof
of mailing or delivery, or (2) a tax account transcript from the state tax authorities. For
the federal returns, he presented no documentation (e.g., copies of the returns, an IRS
tax account transcript, a letter from a tax preparer, etc.) to prove that he filed the
overdue returns. Likewise, he presented no documentation to establish what he is doing
to repay the back taxes owed to the IRS. 
 I have considered the six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and conclude29
that Applicant has not presented sufficient information to rebut, explain, extenuate, or
mitigate the facts proven by the written record. He has not presented a reasonable plan
to resolve his tax problems, nor has he demonstrated a firm commitment to adhering to
that plan. The facts do not support application of AG ¶ 20(c), the problem is being
resolved or is under control, or AG ¶ 20(d), making a good-faith effort to repay. Simply
put, Applicant has known since at least 2012 that his tax problems were a concern in
the security clearance process, he has had ample time and opportunity to resolve his
tax problems, and yet he is still far short of the mark. His inability or unwillingness or
procrastination in dealing with his tax problems raises concerns and doubts about his
judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations. 
The concern over Applicant’s problematic financial history creates doubt about
his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified
information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and
considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice
versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I30
conclude that he did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified
information.

Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
