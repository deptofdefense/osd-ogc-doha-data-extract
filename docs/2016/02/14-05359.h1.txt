Decision

MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Factors outside of Applicant’s control have negatively impacted his household 
income over the years, but Applicant also made some questionable financial judgments. In 
October 2015, he resolved a $95,982 federal tax lien from 2012 through an Offer in 
Compromise. Yet, he and his spouse are still behind in paying their mortgage despite a loan 
modification. Applicant’s wages are being garnished to repay a $24,000 credit card debt. 
While he has been making payments for the past six months to resolve another $35,912 in 
collection debt, financial considerations concerns persist. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On March 18, 2015, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security 
concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and explaining why it was unable to 
find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance 
eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
 
 
 2 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR allegations through his counsel on March 31, 2015, 
and he requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On July 21, 2015, the case was assigned to me to conduct 
a hearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant. On July 23, 2015, I scheduled the hearing for 
August 18, 2015. 
 
At the hearing, seven Government exhibits (GEs 1-7) were admitted into evidence 
without objection. A chart prepared by Department Counsel as a supplement to his closing 
argument was marked as a hearing exhibit (HE 1) for the record, but it was not admitted as 
an evidentiary exhibit. Applicant submitted nine exhibits (AEs A-I), which were admitted 
without objection.
1
 Applicant and five witnesses testified for him, as reflected in a transcript 
(Tr.) received on August 26, 2015. 
 
The record was held open for two weeks after the hearing for Applicant to submit 
additional documents and to provide copies of AEs H2, I, and J to Department Counsel. 
Applicant provided no new documents by the deadline. Counsel for Applicant returned AEs 
H2, J, and K for the record on January 20, 2016. Additionally, Applicant requested through 
counsel that I reopen the record to consider an additional exhibit just received that was not 
available at his hearing. The document was marked as AE K. Department Counsel filed no 
objection by the January 27, 2016 deadline for comment, and the document was admitted 
into evidence.  
 
 On January 28, 2016, counsel for Applicant requested leave to submit additional 
exhibits reflecting payments on the debts in the SOR. Department Counsel indicated on 
February 17, 2016, that the Government had no objection to proposed exhibits AEs L-R, so 
the documents were accepted into the record as exhibits.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
  The SOR alleges that as of March 18, 2015, Applicant was $3,466 past-due on his 
mortgage loan (SOR ¶ 1.a) and that he owed $95,982 in federal income tax debt on a 2012 
tax lien, collection debt totaling $54,704 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f), and a $5,782 charged-
off debt (SOR ¶ 1.g). Applicant admitted the alleged debts with the exception of a $1,087 
debt reportedly owed a sporting goods retailer (SOR ¶ 1.e), which he indicated was his 
son’s debt. Applicant’s admission to the remaining debts are accepted and incorporated as 
findings of fact. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the 
following additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 59-year-old high school graduate with some community college 
studies. He started a career in law enforcement in April 1978. Around June 2004, he retired 
from his full-time position, although he worked part time for the same police department for 
                                                 
1 
AE H was offered and admitted as AE H1 and AE H2.  
 
 3 
the next few years. He began working for his defense contractor employer in its security 
department in July 2007. (GEs 1, 2; Tr. 59-61.) 
 
Applicant and his spouse married as teenagers in July 1976. They have two sons, 
now ages 37 and 26, and a daughter age 29. They have four grandchildren. (GE 1; Tr. 70-
72, 154.) They have helped out family members over the years, even when it strained their 
own finances. (Tr. 113, 169.) When their youngest son was a high school senior, they 
provided a home for his son’s friend whose parents were undergoing a divorce. (Tr. 76-77.) 
Applicant and his spouse has been the primary support for his mother, although their 
responsibilities are not largely financial. Applicant has lost time from work in the last two 
years because of his mother’s repeated hospitalizations and rehabilitations. (Tr. 83, 168.) 
When Applicant’s sister-in-law, who is a single mom, lacked medical insurance, Applicant 
gave her the $200 up-front fee to see a specialist. (Tr. 113.) Applicant and his spouse also 
purchased clothing and presents for her children over the years. Over the last two years, 
they have provided food for his sister-in-law, who was unemployed as of August 2015 
following an accident. (Tr. 116.) Applicant and his spouse aided another sister when her 
husband was unemployed and dealing with a serious medical condition. (Tr. 114.) 
Applicant also helped his brother’s family by taking in his two boys on occasion. (Tr. 115, 
168-169.) On occasion, Applicant and his spouse have helped her parents with their 
mortgage payments. (Tr. 168.) 
 
Applicant and his spouse had their home built at a cost of “maybe $45,000.” They 
have lived there since August 1982. (GE 1; Tr. 70-72. 124-125, 167.) In June 2003, 
Applicant and his spouse opened a $141,241 home equity loan, to be repaid at $1,134 per 
month for 20 years. (GE 6.) 
 
Applicant retired from his civilian law enforcement position around July 2004 with the 
intent of finding another full-time job. In lieu of a pension benefit, he elected to take a 
$400,000 lump-sum payout, which he placed in a retirement account. He was also paid 
between $50,000 and $60,000 for unused sick time, which he put toward household 
expenses. (Tr. 126-127.) Over the next three years, Applicant searched for full-time 
employment without success. He earned upwards of $1,000 a month from his part-time 
work, and his spouse brought in $300 to $400 a month in income from her part-time job. 
(GE 6; Tr. 84-85.) Applicant and his spouse began to fall behind on some consumer credit 
obligations. (GEs 5, 6.) They used the equity in their home to cover expenses. In July 
2005, Applicant opened a $60,000 home equity loan in his name, to be repaid at $506 per 
month for 15 years. Applicant and his spouse paid off 2003 and 2005 home equity loans in 
October 2007 by taking on a joint mortgage for $282,400, to be repaid at $2,295 per 
month. (GE 7; Tr. 125.) 
 
From 2005 to 2007, Applicant also made withdrawals from his retirement account, at 
a ten percent penalty per transaction, to cover household expenses and other bills, 
including assisting his daughter with her college expenses, paying medical costs not 
covered by insurance, and buying a $2,000 to $3,000 shed. (GE 6; Tr. 130.) Applicant also 
bought a car for his spouse.
2
 With taxes and penalties for early withdrawal, he received 
                                                 
2 
Available credit reports show that Applicant opened an automobile loan for $14,596 in August 2005. The 
 
 4 
about half of his original $400,000. He had taxes withheld from his part-time pay in 2005, 
but he then underpaid his federal taxes by approximately $20,000 for that year because his 
retirement account withdrawals were taxed as income. Applicant continued to make early 
withdrawals from his retirement account in 2006 and 2007 because he could not afford to 
meet his household expenses otherwise. He was paying $1,500 monthly in medical 
insurance premiums for himself and his family. (Tr. 128-129.) Applicant and his spouse 
exacerbated their tax issues by having no additional income withheld for taxes in 2006 and 
2007, and by not filing timely returns for at least 2005 and 2006.
3
 While they filed their 
delinquent returns in 2008, they did not pay the taxes owed. (GE 6; Tr. 142.) According to 
Applicant, he had untreated post-traumatic stress and was not thinking properly. (Tr. 84, 
129.) 
 
In July 2007, Applicant began working full time for his current employer at annual 
wages of $40,000. On July 17, 2007, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). Applicant disclosed no 
issues of potential security concern on his e-QIP (GE 2), and he was granted a top secret 
security clearance around October 2008. Around January 2009, Applicant was granted 
access to sensitive compartmented information. (GE 1.) 
 
In February 2008, Applicant’s annual income increased to $45,000. Applicant’s 
financial problems persisted despite the fact that his wages continued to increase by an 
average of $2,500 annually. (GE 6.) In 2012, Applicant and his spouse’s mortgage lender 
initiated foreclosure proceedings after they missed or made only partial payments for three 
consecutive months. (GE 6.) Around July 2013, Applicant and his spouse obtained a 
modification of their mortgage, which they had opened in October 2007. They reduced their 
monthly payment to $1,733, but at the end of their 40 year loan, they will have a balloon 
payment due of $20,313. (GE 7.) 
 
In March 2012, Applicant’s spouse began her present job, working less than 30 
hours per week at $10 an hour. (Tr. 164.) Her take-home pay averaged $800 to $1,100 per 
month. As of July 2013, Applicant was earning $60,000 annually as he had progressed 
through the ranks at work. He contacted his creditors about repayment, but they often 
wanted lump sums that he could not afford. Sometime in 2013, Applicant and his spouse 
received $68,000 in an insurance settlement from an accident in March 2010. 
Approximately $25,000 of the settlement went to pay medical bills incurred by Applicant 
and his spouse. (Tr. 131-132.) Applicant set aside $10,000 for his delinquent federal 
taxes,
4
 although he no longer had any of those funds as of August 2015. (Tr. 129.) The 
                                                                                                                                                             
account was late from 30 to 120 days at times before it was paid off. (GEs 3-5, 7.) 
  
3 
During his interview in March 2014, Applicant explained that he stopped withholding additional money for 
taxes in 2006 and 2007 because he needed the money to pay household bills. He admitted that he had not 
filed returns or paid taxes to the IRS in 2005, 2006, and 2007, and that when he filed his returns in 2008, he 
did not pay the taxes owed. (GE 6.) Applicant apparently did not file timely tax returns for three years. His 
income tax return for tax year 2007 would have been due in 2008, when he asserts that his late returns were 
filed, although it is unclear whether he filed that return by its due date. 
 
4 
Applicant told the OPM investigator in March 2014 that he had set aside $10,000 for his income tax 
 
 5 
rest of the settlement money went to pay bills, to offset the garnishment of his wages, to 
cover truck repairs of $2,000, and to replace the car that had been damaged in the 
accident. (GE 6; Tr. 132-133.) They paid cash for a 2005 model-year vehicle. (Tr. 134.) 
 
 On November 25, 2013, Applicant completed an e-QIP to renew his security 
clearance eligibility. In response to a financial record inquiry concerning whether he had 
failed to file or pay federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance in the 
last seven years, Applicant indicated that he owed federal taxes of $20,000 for 2005, 
$30,000 for 2006, and $35,000 for 2007. He also listed some delinquent consumer credit 
debts. In response to the financial record inquiries, Applicant listed several consumer credit 
delinquencies. (GE 1.) During his subject interview of March 10, 2014, Applicant explained 
that he fell behind on various credit accounts used for living expenses and that he 
occasionally missed a payment when he focused on other bills. Consequently, his creditors 
increased the interest rates on unpaid balances. He eventually stopped paying on some 
accounts. (GE 6.)  
 
Available credit reports (GEs 3-5, 7) and admissions by Applicant during his March 
10, 2014 interview (GE 6), at his August 2015 security clearance hearing, and in a January 
2016 affidavit (AE Q), establish several delinquencies, as follows: 
 
Mortgage delinquency (SOR ¶ 1.a) 
 
 As of December 25, 2013, Applicant and his spouse were making timely payments 
on their home loan after modification. (GE 5.) As of August 2014, Applicant and his spouse 
were $3,443 past due on their mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.a). (GE 4.) They were consistently 30 
days behind in their mortgage payments from November 2014 through July 2015. (GE 7; 
Tr. 135-136.) Additionally, as of August 2015, they owed unpaid late charges of $254.72. 
(AE A.) There is no evidence that they paid the $3,760 due on their account by August 1, 
2015. As of August 7, 2015, their account was $3,466 past due (SOR ¶ 1.a). (GE 7.) 
Applicant testified that their next mortgage payment was to be automatically withdrawn 
from their checking account on August 22, 2015, at which point they would be 22 days 
behind. (Tr. 48.) Applicant attributes the late payment of his mortgage to when he gets 
paid. He expects that his pay day will coincide with the due date on their mortgage in April 
2016, so they will be caught up at that point. (Tr. 49-50.) As of late January 2016, Applicant 
was 1.5 months behind in paying the mortgage. (AE Q.) 
 
Loan in collection for $30,130 (SOR ¶ 1.b) 
 
 Applicant took out a loan in February 2008 for repairs on his home, for living 
expenses, and for his daughter’s wedding. His account was referred for collection after no 
payments since November 9, 2009. When the current creditor purchased the debt in July 
2011, the balance was $29,504.50, of which $28,338.81 was unpaid principal. (GEs 5, 6; 
                                                                                                                                                             
delinquency. (GE 6.) When asked on cross-examination whether any of his insurance settlement from the 
March 2010 accident went toward paying his delinquent taxes, Applicant responded that they paid $2,000. 
They set aside money to pay their taxes but the IRS did not accept their Offer in Compromise. (Tr. 134.) 
 
 
 6 
AEs I, J.)  Around early November 2011, Applicant entered into an arrangement to repay 
the then $30,063.51 balance at $150 per month from November 18, 2011, through October 
18, 2013. Interest continued to accrue on the debt. (AE J.) Applicant asserts that he made 
the payments as required through October 2013. After he noticed in early 2014 that the 
payments were not being debited from his bank account, he was reminded that the 
payment plan was only for two years. (GE 6; Tr. 53-54.) During a March 10, 2014 interview 
with an authorized investigator with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant 
expressed his intent to resume a payment plan in March 2014. (GE 6.) Because his wages 
were being garnished to collect another delinquent debt, infra, Applicant did not have the 
funds to resume payments. (Tr. 54.) As of September 2014, Equifax was reporting a past-
due balance of $30,130 on the debt. (GE 4.) On August 17, 2015, the creditor agreed to an 
initial repayment arrangement, with $150 due by August 31, 2015, $676 due by September 
10, 2015, and then $150 due by the 5
th
 of each month from October 2015 to February 
2016. Applicant was advised that the payment plan could be voided for missing any 
payments. (AE I.) Applicant arranged for automatic payments of $150 a month from his 
checking account. (Tr. 55.) Applicant presented proof of a $300 payment on January 26, 
2016 (AE R), although he indicates that he continues to make payments on schedule. In 
January 2016, he renewed the repayment arrangement at $150 a month for another six 
months. (AE Q.) 
 
Credit card debt in collection for $23,207 (SOR ¶ 1.c) 
 
 Applicant opened the credit card account in August 2001. After no activity since 
December 2008, the account was placed for collection around August 2011 for $19,700. 
(GE 5.) Applicant defaulted on a $20,900 judgment entered in 2012. (GE 6.) Around 
November 2013, Applicant agreed to repay the debt at $450 per month. (GE 1.) As of 
December 2013, Applicant owed a past-due balance of $24,869. (GE 5.) Applicant made 
only a few payments. (Tr. 78.) Equifax reported a past-due balance of $23,537 in 
September 2014. (GE 4.) His wages were being garnished through October 2014 to 
recover another credit card judgment of almost $20,000 (not alleged), infra. When that 
garnishment ended, Applicant did not resume any payments on this judgment because of a 
loss of spousal income due to her medical issues. (Tr. 141.)  
 
 Around April 2015, Applicant contacted the lender about resuming monthly 
payments at $450. He learned that the creditor had filed to garnish his wages to repay a 
past-due balance around $24,000. His wages were garnished for $765 and $710 in May 
2015. (AE L.) As of June 2015, the reported debt balance was $23,103. (GE 7.) His wages 
continue to be subject to garnishment, usually at $640 every two weeks (AE B), but 
sometimes more. Applicant reports garnishments of $710 on September 18, 2015, $806 on 
October 30, 2015, and around $670 in January 2016. More is now being garnished from 
his wages because of his pay increase. (AE Q.) As of January 22, 2016, the balance of the 
debt was approximately $11,338. (AEs E, L; Tr. 79, 140-141.) Applicant expects the debt to 
be paid off in mid-September 2016. (AE L; Tr. 80.) 
 
 7 
Federal tax lien for $95,982 (SOR ¶ 1.d) 
 
 On his November 2013 e-QIP, Applicant listed federal tax debt totaling $85,000 for 
tax years 2005 through 2007. He indicated that he had made partial payments in that his 
tax refunds had been intercepted and applied to his tax debt. He had an attorney working 
with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to satisfy back taxes. (GE 1.) A check of 
Applicant’s credit on December 25, 2013, revealed that the IRS had filed a federal tax lien 
of $95,892 in January 2012. When he was interviewed by the OPM investigator in March 
2014, Applicant attributed his tax debts to his retirement fund withdrawals. He admitted that 
he received requests for full payment from the IRS twice yearly. He ignored the notices 
because he could not afford the lump-sum payment. After his spouse began working full 
time in March 2013, he retained a lawyer toward submitting an Offer in Compromise. 
Applicant expressed his intent to offer the IRS $10,000 to settle his debt with a payment of 
$2,000 to show his good-faith. Should the IRS accept his offer, he planned to then pay the 
remaining $8,000 to resolve his tax delinquencies. If the IRS rejected his Offer in 
Compromise, he would negotiate a payment plan. (GE 6.) 
 
 Applicant testified at his hearing that all of their tax refunds, federal and state, have 
been intercepted and applied to their tax delinquency. (Tr. 142-143.) He did not provide 
any documentation showing an updated tax balance. As of September 2014, the federal 
tax lien from 2012 was still on his credit record for $95,892. (GE 4.) On adjusted gross 
income of $100,108 in 2014, Applicant and his spouse underpaid their federal income 
taxes by $435 for that tax year. They had to pay taxes on $4,066 in gambling income. His 
spouse won two casino jackpots. (AE C; Tr. 145.) She went to the casino with her sisters, 
“just to get out of the house.” She estimates that she “broke even.” Applicant’s spouse 
started with about $50 each time she gambled. (Tr. 170-172.) 
 
 As of August 2015, there had been no progress toward resolving their federal tax 
lien. (GE 7.) The IRS had rejected their Offer in Compromise for $10,000, and they were 
appealing that decision. (AE G; Tr. 86.) The IRS considered his income as sufficient to pay 
the debt within 70 months. (Tr. 86.) As of August 2015, Applicant and his spouse had 
submitted $2,000 with their settlement offer. (Tr. 134-135.) They had paid their attorney 
$3,000 to negotiate with the IRS. (Tr. 144.) 
 
 On October 29, 2015, the IRS notified Applicant and his spouse that they had “met 
the payment provisions for [their] Offer in Compromise contract” for the tax periods 
specified in their offer. The IRS notice did not specify the tax years covered by the offer, 
but those tax periods are likely those covered by the 2012 tax lien, given that the IRS 
indicated their lien would be released within 30 days. (AE K.) Under the Offer in 
Compromise contract, Applicant and his spouse are required to file and pay their taxes 
timely for five years. Any failure to comply will result in termination of the Offer in 
Compromise and reinstatement of the original tax liability minus any payments. (AE K.) 
Applicant intends to file and pay his income taxes as required by law. Timely payment and 
tax filing has not been an issue since tax year 2007. (AE Q.)

Sporting goods collection debt of $1,087 (SOR ¶ 1.e) 
 
 As of December 25, 2013, a $1,087 collection balance from October 2008 was 
being reported on Applicant’s credit record. (GE 5.) Applicant informed the OPM 
investigator in March 2014 that it was his son’s debt. (GE 6.) Applicant’s son testified that 
he ordered items for a baseball team. He offered to pay the bill on a promise that the 
merchandise would be forthcoming. The merchant indicated that the items had been sold. 
Applicant’s son advised the merchant that he was not going to pay for merchandise he did 
not receive. (Tr. 96-98.) Applicant has asked his son to resolve the issue. As of August 
2015, his son had not done so. (Tr. 99.) 
 
Emergency physician debt in collection for $280 (SOR ¶ 1.f) 
 
 As of December 25, 2013, Applicant had not paid a $280 collection debt from March 
2010. (GE 5.) He did not recognize the debt when he was interviewed by the OPM 
investigator in March 2014. After his interview, he inquired about the debt and learned that 
it was a medical debt. (GE 6.) Applicant assumed that the debt was paid from their 
insurance claim for the accident in March 2010. (Tr. 88.) As of August 2015, Equifax was 
reporting that the debt had been placed for collection in April 2015. (GE 7.) Around August 
13, 2015, Applicant made arrangements to pay the debt by automatic debit from his 
checking account on August 15, 2015. The $280 was debited from his draft account on 
August 19, 2015, which left a balance of $2.65 in his account. (AE M; Tr. 147.) 
 
Credit card debt charged off for $5,782 (SOR ¶ 1.g) 
 
 Applicant disclosed on his November 213 e-QIP that he owed a credit card debt of 
$5,800 in collection. (GE 1.) Credit checks reveal that a $5,782 balance was charged off 
and sold around December 2009. (GE 5.) On January 6, 2014, a collection agency offered 
a settlement with three options: a lump-sum payment of $1,445, six payments of $290, or 
12 payments of $193. Applicant told the OPM investigator in March 2014 that he intended 
to pay the $1,445 within the next 30 days. (GE 6.) Applicant did not pay the debt. On 
August 4, 2015, the creditor offered to settle Applicant’s $5,782 delinquent balance for a 
lump-sum payment of $1,445 due August 31, 2015, or for $2,023.92 payable in 12 
consecutive monthly payments of $168.66. Applicant arranged for the monthly payments to 
be withdrawn from his checking account from August 2015 through July 2016. (AE H; Tr. 
91-92, 148.) Applicant made the monthly payments to reduce the balance to $5,107.77 as 
of December 23, 2015. (AE N.) With the increase in the wage garnishment to $670 bi-
weekly for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c, Applicant negotiated a lower payment of $149 per month 
from $168.66 on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.q. (AE Q.) Applicant indicated on January 27, 2016, 
that under the present repayment agreement, any balance remaining on the debt will be 
erased provided he makes the agreed payments through December 2016. (AE Q.) 
 
Credit card judgment for $20,000 (not alleged) 
 
 Around August 2009, Applicant stopped paying on a consumer credit card account 
opened in August 2003. The account was charged off for $19,047. (GEs 3, 5.) On his 
 
 9 
November 2013 e-QIP, Applicant indicated that his wages had been garnished at $500 to 
$600 every two weeks since approximately February 2013 to pay off a $20,000 financial 
judgment entered against him in 2012. (GE 1.) He did not make voluntary payments toward 
the judgment because he was focused on paying other bills. As of December 2013, he had 
paid down the debt to $12,517. (GE 5.) In March 2014, he indicated to the OPM 
investigator that the garnishment would be ending in June 2014. (GE 6.) As of September 
2014, he owed $2,271 on the account. (GE 4.) His wages continued to be garnished 
through October 2014. As of November 2014, the debt was satisfied. (GE 3; Tr. 141.) 
  
 Applicant’s spouse has had several medical issues over the years that made it 
difficult for her to maintain a full-time job. In late 2014, Applicant’s spouse underwent 
surgery for a serious medical condition diagnosed in October 2014. Following post-surgical 
treatment completed in March 2015, she was given a good prognosis. (AE D; Tr. 72-73.) 
She lost time at work during her treatment and recuperation, but she was working 30 to 35 
hours a week as of late July 2015 at $12 an hour. (AE F; Tr. 74, 156, 161-164.) She has 
continued to maintain her work hours as of January 2016. (AE Q.) For the past six or seven 
years, Applicant’s spouse has earned extra income cleaning homes on and off. (Tr. 156-
159.) She incurred some medical costs not covered by insurance, on which she arranged 
to make monthly payments. (Tr. 75-76.) Applicant’s spouse averred that her medical costs 
have caused them ongoing financial problems (Tr. 165), but the specific medical costs 
were not detailed in the evidentiary record. 
 
As of late December 2014, Applicant’s take-home pay was $1,657.52 every two 
weeks. He was repaying two 401(k) loans at $121.25 and $146.41 every paycheck, but his 
wages were not subject to garnishment at that time. (AE O.) 
 
Applicant applied for a promotion in his department in 2015. The then longtime 
director of security at the facility considered Applicant to be “indisputably the right person 
for the position.” Yet, before the company could formally extend the offer, Applicant 
withdrew his name from consideration because of the SOR and uncertainty about his 
security clearance. The director of security, who is now retired, convinced Applicant that it 
was in the best interest of the organization for him to accept the position. Around April 
2015, Applicant was promoted and given a $27,000 increase in salary. He was no longer 
eligible for overtime pay, so his actual earnings increased by about $13,000 a year. (Tr. 32-
39, 63-69, 80-81.) Because he had been in his new position only since April 2015, he 
earned $8,896 more in 2015 than in 2014, from $79,893 in 2014 to $88,789 in 2015. (AEs 
O, P.) As of December 26, 2015, non-tax deductions from his bi-weekly pay included a 
$643.28 wage garnishment for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c and the payments for his two 401(k) 
loans. (AE P.)  
 
Applicant borrowed from his 401(k) in 2013 and in July 2014 to pay household bills. 
(AE B; Tr. 118, 137.) The 2014 loan was for almost $18,000 in anticipation that the IRS 
would accept the Offer in Compromise. (Tr. 137.) A portion of that loan went to the attorney 
retained to revolve his tax issues.  Most of the loan went toward living expenses. (Tr. 138.) 
Applicant had about $53,000 in his 401(k) account at work as of August 2015. His 
outstanding loan balance was $21,094 as of June 30, 2015. (AE B.) He expressed a plan 
 
 10 
to take out a hardship loan from his 401(k) for his federal taxes if he has some resolution 
with the IRS. (Tr. 119.) Applicant testified that he has no other funds available to pay the 
IRS. (Tr. 120.) The money he had set aside from the insurance settlement to resolve the 
income taxes “just started dwindling because of bills coming up.” (Tr. 134.) Provided he 
retains his employment, he expects that he can resolve his delinquencies in the next two 
years. (Tr. 120.) With his wage garnishment for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c and his promised 
payments of $150 per month toward the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b and $168 per month toward the 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.g, Applicant estimated that he and his spouse have $100 in net 
discretionary income each month. (Tr. 148-149.) Applicant and his spouse have no 
significant savings apart from his 401(k). (Tr. 147.) 
 
Work references 
 
 The former director of security and the acting director of security for Applicant’s 
employer both testified for Applicant. The former director of security indicates that he was 
“intimately aware” of the issues that led Applicant to withdraw his candidacy for the 
management position when he convinced him to accept the job. Applicant had 
demonstrated compliance with security requirements. He also had “tremendous capability 
with the force,” having progressed through the ranks. Applicant proved to be a strong 
advocate and a strong presence within his organization such that he managed to bring 
about a “sea change” in the organization in the few months since he assumed his 
leadership position. (Tr. 36-38.) 
 
 The current acting director of security has known Applicant since 1980. They 
previously worked together before he left to work for Applicant’s current employer in 1986. 
He supervised Applicant from the time of Applicant’s hire with the defense contractor until 
Applicant assumed his present position around April 2015. Applicant was always 
trustworthy, professional, and required minimal supervision. (Tr. 102-103.) He recently 
became aware that Applicant was issued an SOR regarding concerns about outstanding 
debt. Applicant informed him that he owes a large sum to the IRS and about his efforts to 
resolve his debts. He was also made aware of “some other sundry debts associated with 
medical bills and that with his wife.” He does not believe that Applicant is a security risk. 
(Tr. 105-107.) Applicant’s work performance has been “outstanding.” He has no record of 
reprimands or security violations with the company. (Tr. 108.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
 
 11 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern about financial considerations is articulated in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 The Guideline F concerns are established by Applicant’s federal tax lien of $95,982, 
his late mortgage payments, the consumer credit delinquencies set forth in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 
1.c, and 1.g, and the $280 collection debt in SOR ¶ 1.f. Disqualifying conditions AG ¶ 
 
 12 
19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting 
financial obligations,” apply. The facts would also implicate AG ¶ 19(g), “failure to file 
annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the 
same,” in that Applicant did not file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2005 and 
2006 until 2008. However, the Government did not cite late filing as a security issue, 
presumably because of Applicant’s rectification. Similarly, Applicant’s consumer credit 
delinquency included an unalleged $19,047 charged-off credit card balance that went to 
judgment around 2012 and was satisfied by wage garnishment, Neither the untimely tax 
filings nor the financial judgment can serve as a basis for disqualification because they 
were not alleged. However, they remain relevant to assessing Applicant’s financial 
judgment generally and to evaluate his evidence in reform.
5
 The garnishment of his wages 
at $500 to $600 every two weeks from February 2013 through October 2014 for the 
unalleged debt compromised his finances and led him to borrow approximately $20,000 
from his 401(k) to pay his household bills. 
  
 As of December 2013, a $1,087 collection balance from October 2008 was being 
reported on Applicant’s record (SOR ¶ 1.e). That debt had been incurred by his son and so 
should not have been reported on Applicant’s credit record. Applicant’s son had ordered 
and was charged for sporting goods equipment that he did not receive. Applicant’s liability 
for the debt was not established. AG ¶ 20(e), “the individual has a reasonable basis to 
dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue,” applies to that debt. 
 
 Security concerns raised by financial delinquency may be mitigated when the debts 
were incurred sufficiently long ago, were infrequent, or were incurred under circumstances 
that do not cast doubt about a person’s current judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. See 
AG ¶ 20(a), “the conditions happened so long ago, were so infrequent, or occurred under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Applicant and his spouse incurred 
the tax debts more than five years ago. While Applicant testified that some of their tax 
refunds had been intercepted, according to the IRS, Applicant and his spouse had a tax 
liability of $95,982 as of January 2012. As of August 2015, that debt had not been 
resolved. AG ¶ 20(a) cannot reasonably apply to the federal tax debt.  
 
Applicant’s consumer credit delinquencies in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g were charged 
off and sold or placed in collection. Even with the garnishment of his wages since April 
2015 to collect the judgment awarded the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c, Applicant owed 
approximately $19,000 on that debt, $30,130 on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b, and $5,782 on the 
                                                 
5
The DOHA Appeal Board has long held that the administrative judge may consider non-alleged conduct to 
assess an applicant’s credibility; to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed 
circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide 
whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for a whole 
person analysis under Section 6.3 of the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 
2006); ISCR Case No. 09-07219 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2012). 
 
 13 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.g as of August 2015. He was behind on their mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.a). AG ¶ 
20(a) also does not mitigate his consumer credit delinquencies. 
 
Applicant has a case for partial application of AG ¶ 20(b). Household income 
suffered at times when his spouse was either unemployed or worked only limited hours 
because of her various medical issues. Applicant worked part-time for three years after he 
retired from his position at the local police department. He paid about $1,500 per month in 
medical insurance costs for his family. Most recently, Applicant’s spouse lost time at work 
between October 2014 and March 2015 for medically necessary diagnostics, treatment, 
and recuperation for a serious medical condition. Applicant and his spouse incurred 
medical costs not covered by insurance for her care, although those expenses were not 
detailed in the record. Applicant lost time at work as well over the past few years to care for 
his mother during her repeated hospitalizations. The financial impact of medical issues is a 
mitigating factor under AG ¶ 20(b): 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
 
Yet, Applicant also made questionable financial decisions that caused or contributed 
substantially to his financial struggles. When he retired around July 2004, he chose to take 
a lump-sum payout of $400,000 rather than a pension, which he initially deposited into a 
qualified retirement account. While he may have not foreseen the difficulty he would have 
in securing another full-time job when he retired, he made the early retirement withdrawals 
that were taxed as income. He and his spouse exacerbated their tax problems by ignoring 
IRS notices received twice annually about their tax debts. It was only after the IRS placed a 
$95,982 tax lien in 2012 that Applicant and his spouse retained legal counsel to negotiate 
with the IRS toward an Offer in Compromise, and that offer was late in coming. Applicant 
borrowed heavily against the equity in his home to pay expenses. Additionally, in February 
2008, Applicant took out the loan in SOR ¶ 1.b for home repairs, living expenses, and for 
his daughter’s wedding. When he stopped paying on the loan in November 2009, he owed 
a principal balance of almost $28,339, when his annual income was only $45,000. 
Applicant and his spouse provided financial assistance on occasion to family members, at 
cost to their own credit. Applicant may have had some medical co-pays from the car 
accident in March 2010, but those costs, if any, are not detailed in the record. 
 
In 2013, Applicant and his spouse received a substantial insurance settlement of 
$68,000 from a March 2010 accident. Only about $25,000 of that settlement went toward 
medical debt. Applicant indicated in March 2010 that he set aside $10,000 for their federal 
tax debt. He admitted at his hearing that only about $2,000 actually went toward their tax 
issues. A large proportion of the insurance settlement, and two 401(k) loans totaling 
approximately $20,000, went to pay household bills because his wages were being 
garnished at $1,000 to $1,200 a month to repay a credit card judgment of approximately 
$20,000 that was not alleged in the SOR. An involuntary wage garnishment to repay a 
legitimate debt is not a circumstance that falls within AG ¶ 20(b). 
 
 14 
AG ¶ 20(b) requires that a debtor act responsibly toward his creditors once the issue 
or crisis that led to the financial problems has passed. Applicant promised the creditor in 
SOR ¶ 1.c in November 2013 that he would make $450 monthly payments. He made few 
payments on that debt. In March 2014, Applicant indicated that he planned to pay $1,455 
to settle the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g within the next 30 days. He did not make that payment. 
Applicant’s spouse won a couple of casino jackpots that netted her $4,066 in income from 
gambling in 2014, which one could reasonably argue should have gone toward their very 
large tax delinquency. As of November 2014, Applicant’s wages were no longer being 
garnished, so they should have had an extra $1,000 to $1,200 a month to put toward his 
delinquent consumer credit debts or their seriously past-due federal taxes. There is no 
evidence that Applicant and his spouse submitted a reasonable Offer in Compromise to the 
IRS at that time. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.g was largely ignored. Applicant’s spouse was 
pending surgery for a serious medical condition at that time, and her health was 
understandably a priority. Her treatment ended in March 2015 with a favorable prognosis. 
In April 2015, Applicant was promoted at work with an increase in his income of about 
$13,000 annually. He contacted the lender in SOR ¶ 1.c about restarting monthly payments 
of $450 toward that debt only to learn that a garnishment order had been issued. He made 
no effort to address even the smaller medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.f until August 2015. To the 
extent that AG ¶ 20(b) applies, it does not fully address the security concerns raised by his 
sizeable debt burden caused in part by his own poor decisions, which he attributes to post-
traumatic stress from his work on the police force. 
 
Applicant’s wages continue to be subject to garnishment for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c, 
presently at approximately $670 every two weeks. The debt should be satisfied in the fall of 
2016. Involuntary garnishment does not qualify for mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d), “the 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts,” although it could implicate AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving 
counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control.” 
 
However, AG ¶ 20(c) and AG ¶ 20(d) apply in part in that Applicant satisfied the 
$280 medical debt in collection (SOR ¶ 1.f) on August 19, 2015. Moreover, Applicant 
arranged to make payments starting in late August 2015 toward the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b 
and 1.g. He indicates that he has continued to pay $150 a month toward the debt in SOR ¶ 
1.b, although he provided proof of only one $300 payment, which was made in January 
2016. Applicant made monthly payments of $168.66 on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g from August 
2015 through December 2015, when he negotiated a lower monthly payment of $149 
because of the increase in income taken by garnishment for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c. His 
monthly payments are indicia, albeit belated, of his intent to address his debts. 
 
Applicant’s debt burden has been substantially lessened by the IRS acceptance of 
his Offer in Compromise for the $95,982 tax lien. IRS documentation (AE K) shows that 
Applicant and his spouse met the payment provisions for their Offer in Compromise 
contract as of October 2015 and that the IRS tax lien would soon be released. It is unclear 
whether the IRS accepted the Offer in Compromise that had been originally rejected (i.e., 
$10,000 with a $2,000 payment accompanying the offer) or an amended offer. Regardless, 
 
 15 
Applicant and his spouse are relieved of repayment liability for a substantial amount of 
debt, provided they comply with their tax filing and payment obligations for the next five 
years. 
 
Some financial concerns remain, however. About the payment required by the IRS 
under his Offer in Compromise, Applicant testified at his security clearance hearing in 
August 2015 that he would have to borrow the funds, likely from his 401(k), to make the 
payment. A third loan from his 401(k) would further reduce his net take-home pay when he 
and his spouse remain chronically behind on their mortgage. As of late July 2015, they 
were behind one full mortgage payment of $1,733.01 and owed late charges of $254.72. 
As of January 2016, they were about 1.5 months behind on their modified mortgage, 
although Applicant indicates that they were gaining three days each month toward 
eventually paying the mortgage on time. Applicant still owes over $28,000 on SOR ¶ 1.b, 
approximately $11,338 on SOR ¶ 1.c, and $4,790 on SOR ¶ 1.g. Apparently, even a slight 
increase in the garnishment of his wages from $640 to $670 per pay period strained his 
finances to the point where he had to lower his monthly payment on SOR ¶ 1.g from 
$168.66 to $149 per month. Applicant has not yet shown a sustained ability to live within 
his means without taking on new debt, and there is no evidence that he has had financial 
counseling that could help him make sound financial judgments going forward.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and 
all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative 
process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at 
the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) 
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
The financial analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. 
Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant 
additional comment. 
 
Applicant’s continued security eligibility is endorsed by both the former director of 
security and by the current acting director of security at his workplace. Applicant 
demonstrated such competence and professionalism in carrying out his duties that the 
former director asked him to accept a management position for the sake of the department, 
knowing that Applicant had serious financial issues. His confidence in Applicant being the 
right candidate for the job was not misplaced. Applicant managed to turn the organization 
 
 16 
around in the few months since he assumed leadership. His positive work record weighs in 
his favor under the whole-person assessment. 
 
A determination of an applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance should not be 
made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a reasonable and careful evaluation 
of the evidence to determine if a nexus exists between established facts and a legitimate 
security concern. Even considering the significant impact of unforeseen circumstances, his 
handling of his personal financial matters, including his federal tax debt and his mortgage, 
is incompatible with the good judgment that must be demanded of persons granted 
security clearance eligibility. Sometime in 2013, Applicant and his spouse received $68,000 
in an insurance settlement from an accident in March 2010. Only about $25,000 of the 
settlement went to pay medical bills. Applicant set aside $10,000 for his delinquent federal 
taxes, although he no longer had any of those funds as of August 2015. In addition to 
being late on the mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.a), Applicant still owes over $44,128 on the debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an 
applicant’s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or 
renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9
th
 Cir. 
1990). Applicant is clearly credited with making payments for the past six months toward 
his delinquent debts, but more progress is needed for me to safely conclude that his 
financial problems are not likely to persist. For the reasons already discussed, I am unable 
to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s 
security clearance eligibility at this time. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:  Against Applicant 
 
 17 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
