GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 3, 2012, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On September 5, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, 
pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial

Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. In sworn statement, dated September 28, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a 
hearing.2 A complete copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was 
provided to Applicant on November 9, 2015, and she was afforded an opportunity, 
within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit 
material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was 
furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Guidelines applicable to her case. 
Applicant received the FORM on November 12, 2015. A response was due by 
December 12, 2015. On December 4, 2015, Applicant submitted her response with 
attachments. Department Counsel had no objections to the documents submitted, and I 
marked them as Applicant Items (AI) A through AI Q. The case was assigned to me on 
December 28, 2015.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d., 1.h., 1.i., 1.n., 
1.o., 1.q. through 1.t., 1.v., 1.x., and 1.y.). Applicant’s admissions are incorporated 
herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of 
fact: 
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been 
serving as a security staff member with her current employer since January 1991.3 A 
1988 high school graduate, Applicant has continued her education online in an 
unspecified discipline since 2011, but has not earned a degree.4 She has never served 
with the U.S. military.5 Applicant was granted a secret security clearance in 1991, and a 
top secret security clearance in 2003.6 Applicant was married in June 1994, and 
divorced in December 1997.7 She married a second time in September 2004.8 She has 
three children, born in 1990, 1993, and 1995.9

Financial Considerations10 
 
Although Applicant experienced some periodic financial difficulties as early as 
2006, there was essentially nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until 2010 when 
she experienced several significant medical issues. In early 2010, she had two 
surgeries on her foot. In August 2010, she experienced an epileptic seizure (she had an 
earlier seizure in 2006) while cooking and spilled hot grease on herself causing 2nd and 
3rd degree burns. She was out of work for three months, and needed 24-hour care from 
her husband who left his job to care for her. In July 2012, she had her third seizure, and 
was out of work for three weeks.  At some unspecified point in 2012, Applicant’s 
husband lost his job due to cutbacks. As a result of a combination of those factors, 
Applicant had insufficient money to maintain all of her monthly payments. She was 
forced to prioritize her bills (children, mortgage, car, insurance, food, and utilities) before 
making other payments, and various accounts became delinquent and were placed for 
collection. She was evicted from an apartment; had judgments entered against her; 
vehicles were repossessed; and her salary was garnished on several occasions.  
 
Applicant chose not to seek bankruptcy protection. Instead, she reached out to a 
number of creditors in an effort to establish settlement agreements or enter into 
repayment plans. She was unable to contact all of her creditors for some of them had 
gone out of business. Various accounts were resolved before the SOR was issued. 
Some accounts were resolved through garnishment.11 Other accounts are currently in a 
repayment plan, and payments are continuing. Applicant stated that it was never her 
intention to not pay her bills, but she noted that under her financial and health 
circumstances, the entire process is expected to take time.12 
The SOR identified 23 delinquent debts that had been placed for collection, as 
reflected by her July 2012 credit report and her January 2015 credit report. Her 23 debts 
total approximately $51,652. Those allegations and their respective current status, 
according to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by the Government and 
Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below. 
Applicant has already either resolved, or is in the process of resolving, the 
following accounts: three medical accounts for $407 (SOR ¶ 1.d.), $35 (SOR ¶ 1.h.), 
and $33 (SOR ¶ 1.i.), and a cellular telephone account for $154 (SOR ¶ 1.q.), are 
represented by the same collection agency and combined, and Applicant is making

1.c.) that was charged off in the amount of $623;27 a bank credit card account (SOR ¶ 
1.o.) with an unpaid balance of $1,356 that was charged off;28 and an automobile loan 
on an automobile (SOR ¶ 1.s.) that was voluntarily repossessed leaving an unpaid 
balance of $2,931.29  
The three remaining accounts fall within two categories. Applicant has been 
unable to identify the creditors for two medical accounts for $153 (SOR ¶ 1.g.) and $135 
(SOR ¶ 1.u.).30 The remaining account is a credit card account (SOR ¶ 1.n.) with a 
credit limit of $500 and a high credit of $1,899 for which Applicant offered two different 
explanations. She initially told the investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) that the account had been paid in full,31 but subsequently indicated 
that she is “currently trying to reach a settlement with them or some type of payment 
plan to pay this debt.”32  
Documentation to support the current status of each of the aforementioned 
accounts has not been uniformly consistent or furnished. Nevertheless, there is 
substantial documentation to support the conclusion that many of the accounts have 
been resolved or are in the process of being resolved. A number of the accounts were 
resolved or were in the process of being resolved well before the SOR was issued. 
Applicant did not submit a Personal Financial Statement reflecting her net monthly 
income, her estimated monthly expenses, her debt payments, or any monthly remainder 
available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence that Applicant ever 
received financial counseling. While she is in repayment plans with some creditors, 
even though some of the accounts have not yet been resolved, it appears that 
Applicant’s financial problems are finally under control and that her financial status is 
improving. 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”33 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his

designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”34   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”35 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.36  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”37

Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”38 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems initially arose in 2010 when she had 
insufficient money to maintain all of her monthly payments. She was forced to prioritize 
her bills, and various accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection. She 
was evicted from an apartment; had judgments entered against her; vehicles were 
repossessed; and her salary was garnished on several occasions. Several of her 
delinquent accounts are still unresolved. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
                                                          
38
 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7.

clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”39 Under AG ¶ 20(e) it is potentially mitigating if “the individual has a 
reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the 
problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by her frivolous or irresponsible 
spending, and she did not spend beyond her means. Instead, those financial problems 
were largely beyond her control. They initially arose in early 2010 when she had two 
surgeries. In August 2010, she experienced her second epileptic seizure while cooking 
and spilled hot grease on herself causing 2nd and 3rd degree burns. She was out of work 
for three months, and needed 24-hour care from her husband who left his job to care for 
her. In July 2012, she had her third seizure, and was out of work for three weeks.  At 
some unspecified point in 2012, Applicant’s husband lost his job due to cutbacks. As a 
result of a combination of those factors, Applicant had insufficient money to maintain all 
of her monthly payments. She was forced to prioritize her bills.  
 
Despite her financial situation, Applicant never shied away from her fiscal 
responsibility. She did not ignore her creditors. After maintaining her prioritized 
accounts, she managed to whittle away the delinquent accounts. Over the ensuing 
years, Applicant resolved a number of those accounts well before the SOR was issued. 
Her repayment strategy was simple: chip away at her debts and pay off some accounts 
before addressing others. Accounts are currently in the process of being resolved or are 
awaiting their turn in the process. Her financial problems are being resolved or are 
under control. While Applicant may not have enjoyed the benefit of financial counseling, 
she appears to have acted prudently and responsibly. Applicant’s actions, under the 
circumstances confronting her, do not cast doubt on her current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.40 
 
                                                          
39
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

Security clearance adjudications are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The 
adjudicative guidelines do not require an applicant to establish resolution of each and 
every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve 
financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no 
requirement that an applicant immediately resolve or make payments on all delinquent 
debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in an SOR be 
paid first. Rather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the 
payment of such debts one at a time.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.41   
     
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant failed 
to insure that her family accounts were kept current. As a result, she was evicted from 
an apartment; had judgments entered against her; vehicles were repossessed; and her 
salary was garnished on several occasions. Several of her delinquent accounts are still 
unresolved.  
 
The mitigating evidence is more substantial and compelling. There is no 
evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling protected 
information, substance abuse, or criminal conduct. Applicant’s financial problems were 
not caused by her frivolous or irresponsible spending, and she did not spend beyond 
her means. Rather, they were largely beyond her control. They arose in 2010, when she 
was initially significantly negatively impacted by a series of serious health issues. They

were exacerbated when Applicant’s husband lost his job. She did not ignore her 
delinquent accounts. Applicant chose not to seek bankruptcy protection. Instead, she 
reached out to a number of creditors in an effort to establish settlement agreements or 
enter into repayment plans. Various accounts were resolved before the SOR was 
issued. Some accounts were resolved through garnishment. Other accounts are 
currently in a repayment plan, and payments are continuing. Applicant stated that it was 
never her intention to not pay her bills, but she noted that under her financial and health 
circumstances, the entire process is expected to take time. While two medical accounts 
remain unresolved because Applicant is unable to identify her creditors, her difficulties 
of identifying the actual healthcare providers cannot be overemphasized. Nevertheless, 
there are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 42 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts, and she started to do so years before the SOR was issued. This 
decision should serve as a warning that Applicant’s failure to continue her debt 
resolution efforts pertaining to her remaining delinquent accounts, or the actual accrual 
of new delinquent debts, will adversely affect her future eligibility for a security 
clearance.43

 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant as security officials may continue to monitor 
her finances, this decision, including the warning, should not be interpreted as a conditional eligibility to hold a 
security clearance. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach limiting conditions 
to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008);

Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial considerations. 
See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.y.:  For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
