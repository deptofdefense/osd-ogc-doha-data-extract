Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny him eligibility for
access to classified information. Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain and
mitigate the concern stemming from his history of financial problems. Accordingly, this
case is decided for Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on February 27, 2013.  Thereafter, on November 5, 2014,1
after reviewing the application and information gathered during a background
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD)  sent Applicant a statement of reasons2
(SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to3
a complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action under the security guideline known as
Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant answered the SOR on December 3,
2014, and he requested a hearing before an administrative judge.
The case was assigned to me on September 18, 2015. The hearing was held as
scheduled on November 9, 2015. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1–3, and they
were admitted. Applicant offered Exhibits A–F, and they were admitted. The hearing
transcript (Tr.) was received on November 23, 2015.  
Ruling on Procedure
The SOR contains three allegations of indebtedness that are duplicates of other
matters in the SOR. First, the past-due account in SOR ¶ 1.b appears to be a duplicate
of the past-due account in SOR ¶ 1.a.  Second, the $409 collection account in SOR ¶4
1.h appears to be a duplicate of the $409 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.g.  And third,5
the $619 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.j appears to be a duplicate of the $619 collection
account in SOR ¶ 1.e.  When the same conduct is alleged twice under the same6
guideline, one of the allegations should be resolved in an applicant’s favor.  Accordingly,7
the matters in SOR ¶ 1.b, ¶ 1.h, and ¶ 1.j are concluded for Applicant.  
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 44-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security clearance
for the first time. He is employed as a technician by a corporation that facilitates
research and development for the federal government. His job involves working on
security access control and alarm systems. He has been so employed since February
 Exhibits 2 and 3. 8
 The 2004–2006 period was shortly before the financial crisis of 2007–2008, which is considered by many9
to be one of the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. It involved, among other things, the bursting
of the U.S. housing bubble, which had seen rising prices for residential real estate fueled by lax lending
practices and speculation.

2013. Before that, he worked as a technician for a security company during 2004–2013.
During most of that period, he had another job in the hospitality industry during
1998–2011. His educational background includes a high school diploma and some
college. He married for the third time in 2008. His first two marriages ended in divorce in
about 2000 and 2007, respectively. He has four children, ages 16, 13, 11, and 7. 
Applicant has a history of financial problems, which he does not dispute. The
SOR contains factual allegations that fall into two groups: (1) a past-due account (120
days or more past due) for a line of credit in the amount of $20,294 with an account
balance of $97,000; and (2) six ordinary collection accounts for a total amount of about
$15,729. Those seven delinquent accounts are established by credit reports from 2013
and 2014.  8
Applicant’s financial difficulties began during his second marriage, which began
in 2004 and ended in divorce in 2007. During the hearing, Applicant explained at length
the circumstances that led him and his then wife to buy two homes, the first in 2004 and
the second in 2006, and the subsequent foreclosures.  The first home had a purchase9
price of about $225,000 with a down payment of a few thousand dollars. The second
home had a purchase price of about $400,000 with a down payment of about $25,000.
The down payment on the second home was made by refinancing the mortgage loan on
the first home and taking out $80,000 in equity. The balance of $55,000 was deposited
into a bank account where, over time, Applicant’s wife, who handled the household
finances, drained the account without Applicant’s knowledge.  Once discovered, the10
marriage did not survive, and Applicant stated the situation “ruined” his credit.  11
The credit reports from 2013 and 2014 confirm the foreclosures.   The March12
2013 credit report shows foreclosures on two real estate mortgage loan accounts with
$0 balances.  The credit reports also show real estate mortgage loan accounts that13
were paid or transferred to or purchased by another lender with balances of $0.  None14
of those matters are alleged in the SOR, but they are part of Applicant’s overall financial
history.

Excluding the duplication, the SOR alleges one past-due account (120 days or
more past due) for a line of credit in the amount of $20,294 with an account balance of
$97,000 (SOR ¶ 1.a). The debt is established by the March 2013 credit report.15
Applicant explained this account is a line of credit that was used as a second mortgage
to buy the second home in 2006.  He stated that he contacted the lender, during the16
course of his 2013 background investigation, and the lender advised they had no record
of the account.  The debt does not appear in the April 2014 credit report or a more17
recent credit report from September 2015.  18
  
Excluding the duplications, the SOR alleges six collection accounts for a total
amount of about $15,729. The largest is a $13,088 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.c.
Applicant explained this collection account stems from a credit card account he used to
pay for attorney’s fees for the divorce from his second wife.  He decided to retain legal19
representation in order to recover some of the money his second wife had diverted and
spent, but he was not successful. The debt remains unpaid, and it does not appear on
the April 2014 credit report or the September 2015 credit report.20
The $954 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.d stems from a balance due on an
apartment lease.  Applicant explained the debt went into collection after a21
disagreement regarding the carpet in the apartment. He settled the debt for $720 in
August 2014, which was a few months before he received the SOR.22
The $619 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.e stems from a utility account for the
second home.  Applicant settled the debt for $433 in July 2014, which was a few23
months before he received the SOR.  24

The $454 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.f stems from a utility account for the
second home.  Applicant explained that his second wife paid the account, but he was25
unable to obtain a receipt of payment.
The $409 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.g stems from a telephone account.26
Applicant recalls paying this debt, but he had no documentation for the account.
The $205 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.i stems from a parking ticket that was
issued to him for operation of a company vehicle during his previous employment.  He27
disputes the validity of this debt because he was not driving the vehicle on the day in
question. He had no documentation on this account.
Applicant estimated his annual income at $65,000.  He had an annual income of28
about $55,000 in his previous job, when he bought the homes and went through the
foreclosures.  His wife works outside the home and she earns about $20,000 to29
$25,000 annually.  He explained that he and his wife are both involved in managing30
their household finances, and they have a good working relationship in this respect.31
He estimated having about $2,500 in bank accounts and about $10,000 in a 401(k)
account.  32
A December 2014 credit report is favorable.  And the most recent credit report33
from September 2015 contains only 1 potentially negative account and 16 accounts in
good standing.  The negative item is a credit card account, opened in July 2004 and34
last reported in March 2009, that was paid for less than the full amount in a settlement.35
The credit report also confirms Applicant’s statement that he and his current wife bought

mortgage loan, and the account is in good standing with no late payments.     
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As37
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt38
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An39
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  40
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting41
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An42
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate43
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme44
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.45

financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In

surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation
omitted). 
 AG ¶ 18.  50

The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.46
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it47
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant48
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 49
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  50
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly compromise
classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It encompasses
concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important qualities. A
person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or
negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
 AG ¶ 19(a) and (c). 51
 AG ¶ 20(a)–(f).52

The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial
history within the meaning of Guideline F.  That history goes back several years to the51
period when Applicant became financially overextended by buying two homes during an
overheated real estate market shortly before it collapsed. Coupled with a spouse who
was financially unfaithful, Applicant’s credit was “ruined,” to use his words. As a result,
he was unable to pay his some of his creditors on a timely basis. 
 In mitigation, I have considered the six mitigating conditions under Guideline F.52
The following mitigating conditions are most pertinent: 
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or death, divorce, or
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances;
and 
AG ¶ 20(c) . . .  there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control. 
Applicant’s problematic financial history is due, in part, to his second marriage,
which was relatively brief. His marital troubles came to a head in 2006–2007, when he
discovered his spouse’s financial unfaithfulness. He acted responsibly under the
circumstances by continuing to work two jobs. Since that time, he married his current
spouse in 2008, and they have worked together to clean up and repair their fiscal
house. Applicant settled two of the collection accounts in 2014. He was also able to
improve his credit worthiness to the point that he qualified for a 30-year mortgage loan
in 2014. Also, a December 2014 credit report shows improvement in Applicant’s credit
worthiness. These circumstances are an indication of financial responsibility and show
Applicant is not ignoring his financial obligations. 
There are also strong indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under
control. In addition to settling the two collection accounts and buying a home in 2014,
the most recent credit report from September 2015 shows only one potentially negative
item, a credit card account that was settled for a lesser amount in 2009, which was
several years ago. Otherwise, the credit report reflects 16 accounts in good standing,
including the mortgage loan. Applicant and his spouse have a gross annual income of
about $90,000; they have about $2,500 in the bank; and he has about $10,000 in a
retirement account. These circumstances show that the condition of Applicant’s fiscal
house, while not perfect, has improved substantially and is on a favorable upward trend.
Overall, the evidence is sufficient to explain and mitigate the concern stemming
from Applicant’s problematic financial history. His financial problems were largely due to
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).53
9
his second marriage, which ended in divorce. Like many people in that situation,
Applicant’s recovery from that setback has been prolonged. Nevertheless, he did not
give up or quit and he is making progress. He also impressed me as a hardworking and
sincere person who takes his financial obligations seriously. The financial problems he
experienced are several years in the past, and his current financial situation is stable. 
The concerns over Applicant’s problematic financial history do not create doubt
about his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect
classified information. Although he did not present a flawless case, he presented
sufficient evidence to resolve the concern. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the
evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the
unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person
concept.  Accordingly, I conclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to53
show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for
access to classified information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.j: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
