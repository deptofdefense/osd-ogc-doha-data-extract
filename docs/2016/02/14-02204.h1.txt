Harvey, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges four delinquent student loan 
debts totaling $76,724. On January 29, 2016, the creditor wrote that the four student 
loan debts were combined; the monthly payment is $250; and they are current. 
Applicant and his spouse’s other student loan debts are either in rehabilitation or in 
current status. He promised to pay his student loan debts, and he has a track record of 
paying his current debts and expenses. Financial considerations concerns are 
mitigated. Eligibility for a public trust position is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 27, 2012, Applicant signed an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On May 19, 
2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) 
issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended, and modified; DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated 
January 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which 
became effective on September 1, 2006.

The SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). (HE 2) The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant’s 
eligibility to occupy a public trust position, which entails access to sensitive information. 
(HE 2) The DOD CAF recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether such access to sensitive information should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked. (GE 1)  
 
On June 17, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing. (HE 3) On October 16, 2015, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to 
proceed. On October 27, 2015, the case was assigned to me. On December 9, 2015, 
the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a hearing notice setting the hearing 
for January 13, 2016. The hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, the 
Government provided 4 exhibits, and Applicant offered 10 exhibits, which were admitted 
into evidence without objection. (Tr. 16-23; GE 1-4; Applicant’s Exhibit (AE) A-J) On 
January 22, 2016, I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.). On February 5, 2016, 
Applicant provided one exhibit consisting of 66 pages, which was admitted into 
evidence without objection. (AE K) The record closed on February 11, 2016. (Tr. 45-46) 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he was responsible for the four 
student loans in the SOR, and he denied that they were delinquent. (HE 3) His 
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 33-year-old medical-enrollment specialist, who has been working 
for his employer since October 2013. (Tr. 9, 25) In 2000, he graduated from high school. 
(Tr. 6) In 2006, Applicant received a bachelor of arts degree. (Tr. 7) In 2010, he married, 
and he and his spouse have a two-year-old child. (Tr. 8) He has never served in the 
military. (Tr. 8) There is no evidence of reportable criminal offenses, alcohol or drug 
abuse, or violations of his employment rules.  
 
Financial Considerations 
  
 Applicant’s financial problems were caused by three circumstances: (1) Applicant 
and his spouse moved to a different state to enable them to care for her father, who had 
two strokes; (2) Applicant’s spouse had cancer, which generated some medical bills; 
and (3) Applicant and his spouse had low incomes, were somewhat underemployed, 
and had excessive student loan debt. (AE J; AE K)  
 
Applicant’s only delinquent debts were in the realm of student loans. He 
disclosed delinquent student loans on his 2012 SF 86, and they are documented in his 
credit report. (GE 1-4) At his hearing, Applicant was unable to explain the convoluted 
                                            
1 Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

history of his and his spouse’s student loans from 2007 to present. I requested that 
Applicant provide two years of payment history for his and his spouse’s student loans. 
(Tr. 44-45) After his hearing, Applicant provided additional documentation which shows 
the four creditors for their student loans have indicated that their student loans are all 
current or in rehabilitation programs at this time. Applicant and his spouse’s total 
student loan debt is about $220,000. 
 
Applicant graduated from college in 2006, and his student loans were deferred 
for the first two years. (Tr. 28) The four student loans alleged in the SOR totaled 
$76,724, and were listed in SOR ¶ 1.a for $23,600; ¶ 1.b for $13,713; ¶ 1.c for $7,826; 
and ¶ 1.d for $31,585. At various times over the last eight years, Applicant’s SOR 
student loans were in deferred status three times, in repayment status five times, in 
forbearance status once, in grace status once, and in default status in 2015, which 
resulted in them being placed on the SOR. (AE K at 26-37) Each of the four loans has a 
different payment history. Applicant consistently made $200 monthly payments to 
address his student loans for several years. (Tr. 29) A creditor’s transaction audit report 
from March 2012 to January 2016 showed numerous payments. (AE K at 41-45) The 
four student loans were combined into one account in 2015. The balance owed in April 
30, 2015, was $77,241, and his required monthly payment was $250. (SOR response) 
The balance owed on January 29, 2016, was $77,186 and the monthly payment was 
$250. (AE K at 38) Applicant’s bank makes automatic $250 monthly payments from 
Applicant’s bank account, and he has been making those payments for two years. (Tr. 
39) At the current rate of payment, it will be many years before the SOR-listed student 
loans debts will be paid. 
 
Federal tax forms issued by creditors show that in 2009, Applicant paid $5,820 in 
student loan interest. (AE E at 4) In 2011, Applicant paid $5,376 in student loan interest. 
(AE A at 2) The amount of student loan interest paid in other years is not part of the 
record.  
 
Applicant’s parents paid part of his student loans, as they are cosigned on some 
of his loans. (Tr. 43) His parents paid one of Applicant’s student loans for $56,000 on an 
unspecified date by taking out a second mortgage on their home. (AE J)  
 
Applicant has a non-SOR student loan with a balance of $44,103 (original 
balance for two loans were $23,279 and $7,200 with a 7.25 percent interest rate on 
both). (Tr. 40; AE K at 1, 46-48) As of January 2016, Applicant made seven monthly 
payments of $5 as part of the creditor’s loan rehabilitation program. (AE K at 46-48) 
 
Applicant’s spouse has five student loans that were combined, and are owed to 
one creditor. (AE K at 51) The total for the five student loans is about $34,000. Applicant 
and his spouse consistently made $350 monthly payments from June 2014 to January 
2016 to address this debt. (Tr. 34; AE A; AE K at 52-57, 60) From July 2013 to June 
2014, her monthly payments were about $175. (AE K at 59-61) On January 21, 2016, 
the creditor wrote the account was current and in good standing. (AE K at 51)

Applicant’s spouse has another student loan from a bank for about $65,127. In 
January 2016, the bank wrote that this account was current. (Tr. 38; AE K at 66-67) In 
2008, the loan balance was $46,592. (AE K at 66) Payments were not made from 
October 2012 to June 2015, when payments resumed. (AE K at 66)  
 
Applicant and his spouse’s joint federal income tax returns show the following 
income and tax information:

2014 $67,139 $8,223 $4,697 $2,500 AE K at 20-25 
 
Applicant received informal credit or financial counseling from his pastor, and he 
provided a budget. (Tr. 27, 47; AE K at 1-3) His taxes are current. (Tr. 27) Applicant’s 
roommate from 2006 to 2008 described him as frugal and conscientious about paying 
his debts. (AE I) Applicant’s father described him as very honest and focused on doing 
what is right. (AE J)   
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a [public trust position].” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Government’s authority to restrict access to 
classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified 
information. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access 
to information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. See Id. at 527.  
 
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”  
Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. “The standard that must be met for . . . 
assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s 
loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to 
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” Regulation ¶ 
C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the 
procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination 
may be made. See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.  
 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, an 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of 
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the 
whole person. An administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial 
and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
sensitive information.   
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position. See ISCR 
Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
      
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her access to 
sensitive information].” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR 
Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
The protection of the national security and sensitive records is of paramount 
consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national 
security.”  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern relating to financial problems: 
 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a trustworthiness 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-
12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his SF 
86, credit reports, and SOR response. Applicant’s SOR alleges four delinquent student 
loans totaling $76,724, and the record establishes that on several occasions these 
student loan debts were delinquent. The Government established the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible 
applicability of mitigating conditions.  
  
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and 
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s eligibility [for a public trust 
position], there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a [public trust position]. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 
(9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising [trustworthiness] concerns, the burden shifts to 
the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. 
The standard applicable in [public trust position] decisions is that 
articulated in Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of 
the national security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
  AG ¶¶ 20(a) to 20(d) are applicable. Resolution of Applicant’s SOR debts and 
maintenance of his financial responsibility were delayed by underemployment, moving 
to a different state, and his spouse’s medical problems, which are circumstances largely 
beyond his control. Applicant and his spouse have about $220,000 in student loan debt. 
Some of those student loans have occasionally been in delinquent status. All of that 
student loan debt is in current status or in a rehabilitation status. Applicant and his 
spouse are both employed outside their home, and their budget has the additional 
pressure of a two-year-old child to care for, which includes day care expenses. It will be 
many years before their student loan debt is paid.     
 
In ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal Board 
addressed a situation where an applicant, who had been sporadically unemployed and 
lacked the ability to pay his creditors, noting that “it will be a long time at best before he 
has paid” all of his creditors. The applicant was living on unemployment compensation 
                                                                                                                                            
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

at the time of his hearing. The Appeal Board explained that such a circumstance was 
not necessarily a bar to having access to classified or sensitive information stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for 
repayment, accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which 
evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). The applicant in ISCR Case 
No. 08-06567 used his limited resources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a 
repayment plan for the remaining debts; and (3) took “reasonable actions to effectuate 
that plan.” Id. The Appeal Board remanded the Administrative Judge’s decision because 
it did not “articulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions,” emphasizing the 
Administrative Judge did “not explain[] what he believes that applicant could or should 
have done under the circumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor 
financial condition, or why the approach taken by applicant was not ‘responsible’ in light 
of his limited circumstances.” Id.   
 
  Applicant has made some progress on his student loans in the last year. He 
understands what he must do to establish and maintain his financial responsibility.3 
Applicant admitted responsibility for and took reasonable and responsible actions to 
resolve as much of his debts as was possible based on his circumstances. There are 
clear indications the problem is being resolved and is under control. His efforts are 
sufficient to mitigate financial considerations trustworthiness concerns.   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the

3The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-

The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 33-year-old medical-enrollment specialist, and he has worked for 
his employer since October 2013. In 2006, Applicant received a bachelor of arts degree. 
There is no evidence of reportable criminal offenses, alcohol or drug abuse, or 
violations of his employment rules. He is sufficiently mature to understand and comply 
with his public trust responsibilities.    
 
Applicant is credited with admitting responsibility for his student loan debts on his 
SF 86. All of Applicant’s and his spouse’s student loans are current or in rehabilitation 
status. His parents paid one of Applicant’s student loans for $56,000. His spouse’s 
illness, underemployment, and the need to move to a different state contributed to his 
financial problems. These are all circumstances largely beyond his control. The Appeal 
Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases 
stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination). There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted).  
 
Applicant understands what he needs to do to establish and maintain his 
financial responsibility. He and his spouse have all of their debts in paid, current, or 
rehabilitation status. He took reasonable actions under his particular financial

circumstances to address his delinquent debts. His overall history shows a “meaningful 
track record” of debt repayment. I am confident he will continue his establishment and 
maintenance of his financial responsibility.4  
  
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, the Directive, the 
Regulation, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. I conclude financial considerations concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for a public 
trust position is granted. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.d:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust 
position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.

4Of course, the Government may re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation, and additional interrogatories. Approval of access to sensitive information now does 
not bar the Government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to 
reconsider [trustworthiness] significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct 
having negative [trustworthiness] significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). 
Violation of a promise made in a [trustworthiness] context to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment 
concerns under Guideline E, and may support future revocation of a public trust position. An 
administrative judge does not have “authority to grant an interim, conditional, or probationary clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006) (stating, “The Board 
has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or probationary [public trust position] to allow her the 
opportunity to have a [public trust position] while she works on her financial problems.”). This footnote 
does not imply that this Applicant’s public trust position is conditional.
