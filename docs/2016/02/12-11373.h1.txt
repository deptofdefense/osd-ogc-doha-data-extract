GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 15, 2012, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP).1  On April 27, 2015, the 
Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel 
Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended and modified (Regulation); DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines 
for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the DOD 
on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under 
the Directive. The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to make

an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for occupying a public trust 
position to support a contract with the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 20, 2015. In a sworn 
statement, dated June 4, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On September 9, 2015, 
Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was 
assigned to me on September 18, 2015. A Notice of Hearing was issued on September 
29, 2015. I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on October 28, 2015.  
 
 During the hearing, 4 Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4) and 11 Applicant 
exhibits (AE A through AE K) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on November 5, 2015. I kept the record open 
to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity. She 
timely submitted a number of additional documents, which were marked as AE L 
through AE Z, and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on 
November 12, 2015. 
  
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted both of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b.) of the SOR. Applicant’s 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been a full-
time technical analyst, working from her home office, for one company (from 8 am to 4 
pm) since September 2005, and for a defense contractor (from 4 pm to 2 am) since 
February 2012. She is seeking to retain her eligibility for occupying a public trust 
position to support a contract with the DOD which was initially granted to her in 
February 2012.2 She has never served in the U.S. military.3 She is a 1990 high school 
graduate with substantial college credits, but no degree.4 Applicant was married the first 
time in August 1995, and they were divorced in December 1997.5 She married her 
second husband in October 2000, and they were divorced in July 2008.6 She married

2003, and a son, born in 2010.8 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about July 2008 
when she and her second husband divorced. A Mediation Agreement9 was signed by 
both parties and their respective attorneys, and incorporated into the Final Judgment of 
Dissolution of Marriage.10 It included the requirements that (1) the marital home be 
awarded to Applicant, and (2) her husband sign a quit claim deed for the residence and 
power of attorney for a vehicle, within ten days of the date of the agreement to 
effectuate the provisions therein.11 It also included the provision that each party would 
claim one child as a dependent, and they would sign the necessary Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) forms annually to affirm the other parent’s right to take such dependency 
allowance.12 Because of the disparity in annual income, Applicant was ordered to pay 
annual child support of $5,611.13.13 
 
The actual financial problems commenced when her second husband refused to 
sign required documentation to enable Applicant to sell the residence or eventually 
prevent its foreclosure. The house had been purchased for approximately $174,000 in 
2004, and refinanced for approximately $236,000 in 2005.14 The adjustable rate 
mortgage (ARM) saw her monthly mortgage payments soar from $1,500 to $3,100, and, 
when her current husband lost his job, she did not have sufficient funds to maintain the 
increased level. The foreclosure process commenced in January 2009, and the house 
was sold at auction in June 2010.15  
 
Her second husband also refused to sign the power of attorney to enable her to 
sell her vehicle when retaining it became too costly as well. In September 2010, the 
remaining balance on the vehicle was $5,000, but she needed $4,000 to repair it. 
Because she could not repair the vehicle, afford to keep it, or sell it, she voluntarily 
relinquished it as a repossession.16

A variety of other accounts also became delinquent, and they were placed for 
collection, charged off, or went to judgment. Applicant reported a significant number of 
her delinquencies in her e-QIP.17 For reasons discussed below, Applicant failed to 
timely file her federal income tax returns for two tax years. 
 
On the advice of her real estate agent, Applicant engaged the professional 
services of a financial counseling service in July 2012, to contact her creditors; explore 
repayment arrangements; settle debts for lesser amounts; work with the IRS; assist her 
in obtaining documentation regarding her foreclosed residence; ensure that information 
in credit reports is accurate; dispute erroneous items with the credit reporting agencies; 
and provide educational material.18  
The SOR identified two allegations that Applicant had failed to timely file her 
federal income tax returns for the tax years 2010 and 2013. She admitted the 
allegations and offered explanations for her inaction.19  
SOR ¶ 1.a.: Applicant noted in her e-QIP that she had issues with her ex-spouse 
over her real estate loss and dependent claims, and she was attempting to resolve 
those issues before filing her federal income tax return for 2010.20 During her interview 
with a representative from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), she added 
that she estimated that she owed about $3,000 and could not file for a deduction related 
to the foreclosure of her residence because her ex-husband had refused to sign the 
necessary documentation.21  
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant was slightly more specific when she stated 
that she had requested copies of a Form 1099-A, Acquisition or Abandonment of 
Secured Property, or to determine if her ex-husband had received one and completed it 
in his own name. All her efforts failed.22 During the hearing, Applicant noted that her 
financial counselor had advised her to “hold off” on the filing of her 2010 federal income 
tax return until she had a better picture of her finances.23 The financial counselor’s 
statement was “if you haven’t gotten a letter yet, don’t worry about it until we get to the 
other side of this process.”24 The guidance furnished was wrong, for it was, in essence, 
a recommendation to violate the law. Applicant learned the truth when she spoke with

the IRS representative who told her “you should just file and whatever comes after that 
you can deal with it at that point in time.”25 Applicant finally filed her Form 1040A, U.S. 
Individual Income Tax Return for 2010 in May 2015.26  
SOR ¶ 1.b.: During the first quarter of 2014, Applicant and her husband were in 
the midst of closing on their new residence. Because of the issues they encountered in 
two previous attempts to obtain a mortgage, they filed for an extension for the 2013 
income tax return with the IRS in order to retain more liquid funds available in the event 
they might be needed at closing. Unfortunately, they failed to file the income tax return 
before the expiration of the extension.27 Applicant finally filed her Form 1040, U.S. 
Individual Income Tax Return for 2013 in May 2015.28  
 
On May 22, 2015, Applicant and her husband entered into an Installment 
Agreement covering the tax periods 2010 and 2013. Based on a total liability of $4,383 
for both periods, Applicant agreed to pay a one-time $120 user fee plus $500 each 
month.29 She has continued making her monthly payments since May 2015.30 Applicant 
and her husband timely filed their federal income tax return for 2014.31  
 
Although Applicant did not submit a Personal Financial Statement to describe her 
overall financial status, it appears that her combined monthly income from her two jobs 
is an estimated $11,946, derived from adding her salary deposits each month over the 
span of July through October 2015.32 It is difficult to assess the remaining features of 
her financial record, including normal monthly expenses or debt payments, or to 
determine if she has any remainder available for discretionary savings or spending. 
Nevertheless, in the absence of any other delinquencies, it appears that Applicant's 
financial problems are now under control. Applicant has never received any other 
financial counseling.33

Work Performance and Character References 
Applicant’s team leader and two coworkers have known her for different periods 
of time, between four years and ten years. Their assessments of her professional 
knowledge and abilities, as well as her character, are all positive. Applicant is described 
as extremely knowledgeable in diverse areas of information technology, thorough and 
timely in expediting assigned tasks, an excellent trouble shooter, hardworking, flexible, 
dedicated, reliable, trustworthy, and honest.34 Several long-term friends also focus on 
her reputation for reliability, personal integrity, honesty, and trustworthiness.35 Family 
members are also very supportive of her.36 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”37 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. Positions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as “sensitive 
positions.”38 “The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is 
that, based on all available information, the person’s loyalty, reliability, and 
trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security.”39 Department of Defense contractor 
personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any 
final unfavorable access determination may be made.40  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a public trust 
position.

An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”41 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.42  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  
Furthermore, security clearance determinations, and by inference, public trust 
determinations, should err, if they must, on the side of denials.43 In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations 
is set out in AG ¶ 18:

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

 Cir. 1994).

Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes a specific condition that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(g), “a failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required. . .” may raise security concerns. Applicant failed to timely file her federal 
income tax returns for 2010 and 2013. AG ¶ 19(g) has been established.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c).  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) applies. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) partially apply.  Applicant’s financial 
problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending. The nature, 
frequency, and recency of Applicant’s isolated financial difficulties related to her failure 
to timely file her income tax returns facilitate the conclusion that those financial issues 
were relatively recent and they were infrequent. Her initial failure to file her federal 
income tax return for 2010 arose because of her misunderstanding of her 
responsibilities under the law as misrepresented to her by a financial counselor, as well 
as her ex-husband’s refusal to comply with the court order by failing to furnish Applicant 
with the required documentation to obtain clear title to her vehicle and residence. His 
inaction prevented her from either refinancing or selling them. The combination of her 
divorce and her ex-husband’s actions contributed to some accounts becoming 
delinquent. But Applicant’s initial mistaken inaction was the sole factor leading to her 
failure to timely file the income tax return for 2010. Applicant could have filed her return 
and eventually filed an amended return, as she subsequently learned upon speaking 
with the IRS representative. Applicant finally filed her federal income tax return for 2010 
in May 2015. 
 
Applicant’s failure to timely file her federal income tax return for 2013 is a 
separate issue. She and her husband filed for an extension for the 2013 income tax 
return with the IRS in order to retain more liquid funds available in the event they might 
be needed at closing. Unfortunately, they failed to file the income tax return before the 
 
9 
                                      
 
expiration of the extension. Applicant finally filed her federal income tax return for 2013 
in May 2015.  
 
In May 2015, Applicant and her husband entered into an Installment Agreement 
covering both tax periods. With a total liability of $4,383 for the combined periods, 
Applicant agreed to pay a one-time $120 user fee plus $500 each month. She has been 
making her monthly payments since May 2015. Applicant and her husband timely filed 
their federal income tax return for 2014.  
 
Applicant’s combined monthly income from her two jobs is an estimated $11,946. 
While it is difficult to assess the remaining features of her financial record, in the 
absence of any other delinquencies, it appears that Applicant's financial problems are 
now under control. Her actions no longer cast doubt on her current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.44 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public 
trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.45   
     
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. She failed to 
timely file her federal income tax returns for 2010 and 2013. 
 
 The mitigating evidence is more substantial and compelling. There is no 
evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling protected

information, or substance abuse. According to her supervisor, coworkers, friends, and 
family, she is a highly respected, reliable, honest, and trustworthy individual. Confronted 
with financial issues following her divorce from her second husband, and his refusal to 
comply with the court order to furnish Applicant documentation to clear title to her 
vehicle and residence, Applicant turned to a financial counselor for guidance. That 
guidance was incorrect, and it led to Applicant withholding the filing of her federal 
income tax return for 2010. She was wrong, and has acknowledged making a mistake in 
not timely filing that return. Although she filed for an extension for the 2013 income tax 
return, in the midst of obtaining a home mortgage, the actual final filing was overlooked. 
She entered into an Installment Agreement with the IRS. The income tax returns for 
both years were finally filed in May 2015. While a variety of accounts also became 
delinquent, and they were placed for collection, charged off, or went to judgment, and 
she reported a significant number of them in her e-QIP, they have all been resolved, 
and they were not alleged in the SOR. There are clear indications that Applicant’s 
financial problems are under control. 
 
Applicant’s two federal income tax issues were finally resolved one month after 
the SOR was issued. This decision should serve as a warning that Applicant’s failure to 
continue her agreed income tax payments, or her failure to continue timely filing future 
federal income tax returns, will adversely affect her future eligibility for a public trust 
position.46 Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for such a position. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   For APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant

 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant as security officials may continue to monitor 
her finances, this decision, including the warning, should not be interpreted as a conditional eligibility to occupy a 
public trust position to support a contract with DOD. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no 
authority to attach limiting conditions to an applicant’s public trust position. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 
(App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 
06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006); ISCR Case No. 04-
04302 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-17410 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-
0109 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000).

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility to 
occupy a public trust position to support a contract with DOD.  Eligibility is granted.
