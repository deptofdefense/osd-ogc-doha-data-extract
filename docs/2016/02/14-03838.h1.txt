Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny him eligibility for
access to classified information. In 2013, the then 32-year-old Applicant became
involved with a 14- or 15-year-old girl resulting in his conviction for contributing to the
delinquency of a minor, a class 1 misdemeanor. He did not present sufficient evidence
to explain and mitigate the security concerns. Accordingly, this case is decided against
Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on February 11, 2014.  About a year later on April 26, 2015,1
after reviewing the application and information gathered during a background
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD)  sent Applicant a statement of reasons2
(SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to3
a complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action under the security guidelines known
as Guideline J for criminal conduct, Guideline D for sexual behavior, and Guideline E for
personal conduct. Applicant answered the SOR on July 10, 2015. 
The case was assigned to me on September 18, 2015. The hearing was held as
scheduled on November 10, 2015. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1–3, and they
were admitted. Applicant offered Exhibits A and B, and they were admitted. No
witnesses other than Applicant were called. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on
November 18, 2015.  
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 34-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance
previously granted to him. He is employed as an information-technology engineer
working in support of military procurement activity. He has worked in this capacity for a
succession of three companies since 2012. He has a good record of employment and
favorable recommendations.  He has worked in the field of information technology since4
about 2006.  He has never married and has no children.  5
During July–August 2013, while holding a security clearance, Applicant became
involved with a 14- or 15-year-old girl resulting in his conviction for contributing to the
delinquency of a minor, a class 1 misdemeanor, which subjected him to a maximum
punishment of confinement in jail for 12 months and a $2,500 fine, either or both.  In6
December 2013, with assistance of counsel, he pleaded not guilty (apparently it was an

evidence to convict him.

Alford plea),  and he was found guilty as charged.  The state court imposed a jail7 8
sentence of 6 months, which was suspended for 12 months on the conditions of good
behavior, keeping the peace, and paying fines and costs. The state court issued a no-
contact order between Applicant and the victim and her family members. The court also
ordered Applicant to pay $84 in costs but a fine was not imposed. Applicant served the
sentence without incident. He did not have any court-ordered or self-directed evaluation,
counseling, or treatment related to this incident. 
Applicant explained that he was introduced to the girl by her mother, whom he
met by being a regular customer at a gas station/convenience store business. The
mother provided her daughter’s cell phone number to Applicant. Initially, he and the girl
exchanged text messages, some of which were sexual in nature, although there were
no nude or lewd photographs exchanged.  Eventually, they met at a restaurant and had9
appetizers, and they then went to Applicant’s car where they talked, kissed, and he
fondled the girl above the waist.  He explained that the situation felt weird, and he cut10
off all communications with the girl.  11
Applicant did not discuss the topic of age with the girl,  although he had12
indications she was a minor. After his conversation with the girl’s mother, Applicant
received a text from someone (perhaps the girl’s aunt) asking his age and telling him
that the girl was 15 years old, and he agreed not to communicate with her due to the
age difference.  Applicant then received another text, apparently from the mother, who13
told him he could continue communicating with the girl.  The text messages continued14
until they met at the restaurant. 
Law enforcement became involved after the girl’s father was made aware of the
situation.  Applicant cooperated with the police investigation and discussed the15
situation with an investigator without the assistance of legal counsel.  During the16

investigation, Applicant was told the girl was 14 or 15 years old.  Due to the incident,17
Applicant was fired from his job in September 2013, but  he was hired by his current
employer and resumed his regular duties that same month at the request of the
government customers.

Applicant disclosed the incident when he completed a February 2014 security clearance
application.  He provided additional information about the incident in an April 201419
background investigation.  He provided court records to the Defense Department in20
April 2015.21
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As22
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt23
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An24
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  25
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting26

evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An27
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate28
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme29
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.30
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.31
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it32
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
The SOR contains a single factual allegation cross-alleged under Guideline J for
criminal conduct, Guideline D for sexual behavior, and Guideline E for personal
conduct. Accordingly, these matters are factually interrelated and are discussed
together. Applicant’s misconduct and resulting misdemeanor conviction raise serious
concerns about his suitability for access to classified information. His misconduct and
associated poor judgment are disqualifying under AG ¶¶ 31(a) and (c) under Guideline
J, AG ¶¶ 13(a), (c), and (d) under Guideline D, and AG ¶ 16(c) under Guideline E.  
Those same guidelines contain various conditions that may serve to mitigate the
concerns raised by Applicant’s behavior. I have considered all the mitigating conditions
and conclude that none, either individually or together, are sufficient to mitigate the
concerns. In particular, the offense is not so minor, nor has so much time passed, that
the misconduct no longer casts doubt on Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and

good judgment. With that said, Applicant is credited with voluntarily reporting the
information in the security clearance application and during the background
investigation. He also appears to have been truthful in responding to questions during
the security clearance process. 
Nevertheless, I have serious doubts about Applicant’s judgment and self-control.
My doubts are based on Applicant’s behavior in 2013, when he chose to pursue a
relationship with a girl that he had good reason to believe was a 15-year-old minor. At
the time, he was a 32-year-old cleared employee working for a defense contractor.
Given the surrounding circumstances, Applicant’s behavior in 2013 was the epitome of
poor judgment. His poor judgment cannot be mitigated based on the passage of time,
because he completed serving the suspended jail sentence in December 2014, which is
not that long ago. Likewise, the incident is not so far in the past that it is now stale, old
news of little to no security significance. 
In addition, I note that I had the opportunity to observe Applicant’s demeanor
during the hearing. He impressed me as too nonchalant about his overall situation, and
he was not particularly contrite. 
Applicant’s misconduct and associated poor judgment in 2013 justify current
doubts about his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified
information. In reaching this conclusion, I considered the whole-person concept,  and I33
gave due consideration to Applicant’s favorable evidence, including his good
employment record and favorable recommendations. I also weighed the evidence as a
whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or
vice versa. Accordingly, I conclude he did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to
show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for
access to classified information.
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline J: Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.a: Against Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline E: Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.a: Against Applicant
Paragraph 3, Guideline D: Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 3.a: Against Applicant

Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
