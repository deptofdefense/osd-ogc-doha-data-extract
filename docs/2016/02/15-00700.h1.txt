FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on June 12, 2014. On 
August 6, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 2006.  
 
 Applicant answered the SOR on September 8, 2015, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October 
8, 2015, and the case was assigned to me on October 23, 2015. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 29, 2015, 
scheduling the hearing for November 18, 2015. I convened the hearing as scheduled.

Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through G, which were 
admitted without objection. I kept the record open until December 7, 2015, to enable 
him to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX H through N, 
which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 
30, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations. His admissions 
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 39-year-old ship designer employed by a defense contractor since 
April 2007. He has held an interim security clearance for about a year, but he has never 
held a final clearance. (Tr. 8.) His wife is also employed by a defense contractor. (Tr. 
48.) 
 
Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from January 1997 to May 2001 
and received an honorable discharge. He attended a community college from January 
2003 to May 2006 but did not receive a degree. He was unemployed from January 2004 
to April 2006. He worked for a non-government company from May 2006 until he began 
working for his current employer.  
 
 Applicant married in May 2002. He and his wife have a 12-year-old daughter. His 
wife has a 20-year-old son from a previous relationship. Applicant and his wife lived 
beyond their means, using various credit cards, from 2002 to 2005. They obtained a 
debt-consolidation loan in 2005. The status of this loan is described in the discussion of 
SOR ¶ 1.b below. Their financial problems were exacerbated when they temporally 
separated for a short time in 2010, due to family hardships, and they incurred the 
additional expenses of maintaining two households. (Tr. 20.) 
 
 The delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are reflected in Applicant’s credit 
bureau reports (CBRs) (GX 2-4.) The evidence concerning the status of these debts is 
set out below. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a, credit-card account, charged off for $1,206. This debt was for 
purchases of electronics. The last transaction in this account was in 2009 (Tr. 33.) In his 
answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he was working with the creditor to resolve 
this debt. He entered into a payment agreement for this debt on November 4, 2015, 
providing for an initial payment of $300 and monthly payments of $61.36. He has made 
the initial $300 payment. (AX A; AX I.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b, unsecured debt-consolidation loan, charged off in March 2008 
for $14,369. The original amount due on this debt was $16,615. The debt was incurred 
to consolidate several credit-card accounts around 2005. Applicant was making monthly 
$325 payments to the debt-consolidation company until it went out of business, and the 
 
3 
 
loan was transferred to another creditor around 2006. Applicant stopped making 
payments around 2007 because he could not afford them. (Tr. 38-40.) The account was 
referred to a collection agency, and Applicant had made payments totaling about $1,700 
as of January 2013. Another collection agency took over the debt, and by November 
2015, Applicant had made payments totaling about $3,600 and reduced the debt to 
$14,369. (AX B; AX C.) The new collection agency wanted monthly payments of $460, 
which Applicant could not afford. (Tr. 26-27.) As of the date of the hearing, he was 
negotiating with the new collection agency and trying to resolve all his smaller debts so 
that he would be in a better position to settle this debt. (AX H; Tr. 15-17.)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c, medical bill referred for collection of $330 in August 2011. This 
debt was paid in full in February 2015. (AX D; Tr. 28.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d, credit-card account charged off for $2,000 in January 2008. This 
debt was settled in December 2015. (AX N.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e, credit-card account referred for collection of $6,431 in June 
2014. Applicant’s wages were garnished to collect this debt, at the rate of $30 per week. 
As of the end of October 2015, he had paid $2,130 and owed a balance of $3,260. (AX 
E.) 
 
 Applicant and his wife recently purchased a home. Their home mortgage loan 
payments are $1,765 per month. He has an eight-year-old truck, on which the payments 
are $240 per month, and his wife has a two-year-old SUV, on which the payments are 
$465. Their joint monthly net income is about $6,910. They reported an adjusted gross 
income of $144,380 on their joint federal income tax return for 2014, which was a 
substantial increase from the adjusted gross income of $93,961 for 2012. (AX M; AX L.) 
Their monthly expenses are about $5,215. Their budget includes saving 10% of their 
monthly income ($691). They have a “surplus” of $1,004, which they use for haircuts, 
parking, lunches, household and car maintenance, and taxes. (AX J.) Their budget does 
not include payments on the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c. The garnishment for the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.e appears to be reflected in his net pay. 
 
 Applicant’s performance appraisal for July to December 2014 rated his 
performance as “satisfactory.” (AX G.) His performance appraisal for January to June 
2015 was “satisfactory” and recommended promotion to the next classification level. 
(AX F.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
 
4 
 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s admissions, corroborated by his CBRs, establish two disqualifying 
conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”) 
and AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”). The following mitigating 
conditions under this guideline are potentially applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous, 
ongoing, and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. 
 
 
6 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is partially established. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c was for medical 
expenses, many of which were incurred by Applicant’s wife in June through August 
2013. The nature of the medical services, including pathology and anesthesiology, 
indicate that they were more than routine examinations. Applicant acted responsibly by 
resolving the medical debts in February 2014.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is not established for the non-medical debts. Applicant attributed his 
delinquent debts in part to a family separation in 2010. However, his financial problems 
started around 2005 due to excessive spending.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not obtained financial counseling. 
Although he has made considerable progress, the evidence falls short of “clear 
indications” that his financial problems are under control, because he had not yet 
reached a payment agreement for his largest debt, alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b, when the 
record closed. 
 
 AG ¶ (d) is established. “Good faith” within the meaning of this mitigating 
condition means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and 
adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts 
only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance.  
 
 A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-
02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not required to establish resolution of every 
debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to resolve financial 
problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The adjudicative guidelines 
do not require that an individual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, 
nor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 
07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
 Applicant began to address his financial problems in 2005, when he obtained a 
debt-consolidation loan. He made regular payments until 2007, and then his payments 
became erratic. However, he made payments totaling $1,700 between 2007 and 
January 2013, and an additional $1,900 between January 2013 and November 2015. 
He has kept in contact with the series of collection agencies that have owned the debt. 
 
 Applicant did not fully appreciate the impact of his financial problems on his 
career until he moved to a job that required a security clearance. Since submitting his 
SCA in June 2014, he has resolved the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. Only the 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.b remains unresolved, and he is negotiating a settlement of the debt 
with the current collection agency. 
 
The fact that Applicant is paying the debt in SOR ¶1.e through garnishment 
rather than a voluntary effort diminishes its mitigating force. Satisfaction of a debt 
through involuntary garnishment “is not the same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation 
 
7 
 
of repayment by the debtor.” ISCR Case No. 09-5700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011), citing 
ISCR Case No. 08-06058 (App. Bd. Aug.26, 2010). However, satisfaction of a debt by 
garnishment does not bar mitigation of financial concerns. ISCR Case No. 04-07360 
(App. Bd. Sep 26, 2006). 
 
 Applicant has been methodically addressing his debts since about 2005. I have 
considered the fact that he accelerated his debt-resolution efforts when he learned that 
he needed a security clearance. However, the timing of his efforts does not render the 
mitigating conditions inapplicable. See ISCR Case No. 08-06058, supra. Under the 
circumstances of this case, his acceleration of his efforts, motivated by his need for a 
security clearance, does not significantly undermine the overall good faith he has 
demonstrated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant has worked for his current employer since 2007, has performed well, 
and has been recommended for a promotion. He held an interim clearance for more 
than a year. He was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. A lending institution 
found him credit-worthy for a home mortgage loan. He and his wife have methodically 
addressed their delinquent debts, abandoned their undisciplined use of credit cards, 
and adopted a reasonable family budget. They have the financial means to carry out 
 
8 
 
reasonable payment plans for their remaining debts. I am confident that Applicant will 
continue his good-faith efforts to the resolve his remaining delinquent debts.1 
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. Accordingly, I conclude 
he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.e:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant 
eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is 
granted.

1 Administrative judges do not have authority to grant conditional clearances. ISCR Case No. 99-0901, 
2000 WL 288429 at *3 (App. Bd. Mar.1, 2000). See also ISCR Case No. 01-24328, 2003 WL 21979745 
at *2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2003). However, applicants do not have a vested right to a security clearance. 
“The Government has the right to reconsider the security significance of past conduct or circumstances in 
light of more recent conduct having negative security significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. 
Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). Violation of a promise made in a security context to pay legitimate debts also raises 
judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future revocation of a security clearance.
