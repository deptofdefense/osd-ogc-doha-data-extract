Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny him eligibility for a
public trust position. He has a problematic financial history based primarily on a lengthy
period of unemployment during 2012–2014, and he has since made a good-faith effort
to put his fiscal house in order.  He presented sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate
his financial difficulties. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted two Questionnaires for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on April 18, 2014, and February 4, 2015.  On July 10, 2015,1
after reviewing the applications and information gathered during a background
investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent Applicant a statement of reasons
(SOR), as amended, detailing a trustworthiness concern under Guideline F for financial
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia.

considerations.  The action was taken under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,2
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended
(Directive); Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program
(Jan. 1987), as amended (Regulation); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG)3
implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006.   
Applicant answered the SOR on or about August 10, 2015, and he requested a
hearing. The case was assigned to me on December 1, 2015. The hearing was held as
scheduled on January 20, 2016. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1–3, and they
were admitted. Applicant offered Exhibits A–V, and they were admitted. Other than
Applicant, no witnesses were presented. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on
January 29, 2016. 
Rulings on Procedure
The SOR was amended to correct the case caption to show it is a public trust
case, not a security clearance case.  In addition, the SOR was amended to state that4
the tax lien in SOR ¶ 1.f is a state tax lien, not a federal tax lien.5
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 39-year-old senior analyst for a health-care contractor to the
Defense Department.  His educational background includes a bachelor’s degree. He6
has never married and has no children. He is seeking to obtain eligibility to occupy a
position of public trust for his current job responsibilities. Eligibility is necessary because
his job involves access to sensitive but unclassified information. 
Applicant’s employment history includes a lengthy period of unemployment. He
was employed by a consulting firm and its successor-in-interest during 2006–2012. In
June 2012, he left his job as a senior consultant for a new opportunity. The new job
lasted until the end of August 2012, when he left under a mutual agreement with his
employer following notice of unsatisfactory performance. He was then unemployed for
about 21 months. He had a short-term position in June 2014, and he began his current
job in July 2014. Due to unemployment, Applicant was unable to pay recurring bills, he

was unable to afford rent, and he was homeless for a period.  Applicant began at a7
salary of about $88,000 when he returned to the workplace in 2014,  and he now earns8
a salary of about $95,000.  
The allegations in the SOR fall into the following categories: (1) tax problems as
reflected by a state tax lien for $2,997 filed in December 2011, and failure to file a state
income tax return in 2009; (2) a student loan account in collection for nearly $100,000;
(3) an unpaid judgment for $1,620 obtained in 2008; and (4) ordinary collection or
charged-off accounts for a total of $2,063. These matters are addressed below.
Applicant paid off the state tax lien and obtained a release thereof in July 2014.9
He filed the 2009 state income tax return in May 2014.  He also rehabilitated the10
student loan account, and it is in good standing with a balance of about $186,000.  11
Applicant explained the unpaid  judgment for $1,620 stems from an apartment
lease, and he disagrees with the total amount owed.  He also explained that he paid12
$850 by forfeiture of his security deposit. The judgment does not appear on Applicant’s
2015 and 2016 credit reports.13
The $537 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.b is established by a December 2014
credit report (account # 41451XXX).  The debt is not reported in more recent credit14
reports from 2015 and 2016.  15
Applicant recalls paying the $50 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.c stemming from
an NSF check, although he does not have proof of payment.  The debt is not reported16
in more recent credit reports from 2015 and 2016.17

The $891 charged-off account in SOR ¶ 1.d is established by a December 2014
credit report (account # 54889XXXXXXX).  Applicant believes this debt is a duplication18
of the collection account in SOR ¶ 1.b, but the account numbers are not similar.  The19
debt is not reported in more recent credit reports from 2015 and 2016.  20
The $475 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.g is in dispute.  Applicant submitted a21
written dispute of this account in June 2014.  The debt is not reported in more recent22
credit reports from 2015 and 2016.  23
The two $55 collection accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i stem from unpaid traffic
tickets.  Applicant paid those accounts in 2014.  He also presented proof of payment24 25
of other traffic tickets.26
In addition to the debts in the SOR, Applicant presented proof of payment of a
$632 collection account (account # XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-9930) in October 2014 with a
payment of $651.  The debt is listed in a May 2014 credit report as a collection account27
with a high credit of $632 and a balance of $0, because it was charged off and sold to a
collection agency that Applicant ultimately paid.  Likewise, Applicant paid a $65228
collection account (account # 1797XXXX), as reflected in credit reports from May 2014
and December 2014.  Applicant may have confused these two accounts with the debts29
in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d. He believes the latter two debts were paid, but documentary
proof is lacking.

Applicant described his current financial situation as “good.”  His credit reports30
from 2015 and 2016 reflect credit scores of 672 and 688, which are considered “good.”31
In January 2016, he obtained initial approval of a mortgage loan to purchase a home.32
He stated he has a savings account with a balance of about $3,000, and he estimated
having about $1,700 in checking.33
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant34
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 35
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect [sensitive] information.  36
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly compromise
sensitive information to obtain money or something else of value. It encompasses
concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important qualities. A
person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or
negligent in handling and safeguarding sensitive information.

The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial
history within the meaning of Guideline F.  In addition to the delinquent debts, Applicant37
fell behind on his state income tax obligations, including failing to timely file returns.  38
 In mitigation, I have considered six mitigating conditions under Guideline F.  The39
following are most pertinent:
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or death, divorce, or
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
AG ¶ 20(c) . . . there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control; and 
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
I am persuaded that Applicant’s problematic financial history is based for the
most part on a lengthy period of unemployment during 2012–2014, and he has since
made a good-faith effort to put his fiscal house in order. After enduring a difficult period
of unemployment, he acted responsibly under the circumstances by beginning to
address his financial issues upon his return to work in 2014. He resolved the tax issues,
and he rehabilitated the student loan account, which is now in good standing. Those are
high priority debts, and he receives substantial credit for resolving those matters. He
disputes one collection account, he paid collection accounts associated with traffic
tickets, and he paid two collection accounts not alleged in the SOR. He has additional
work to do in resolving the unpaid judgment and collection accounts for a relatively
small sum of money. Although he did not present a perfect case in mitigation, there are
clear indications that his problematic financial history is being resolved and is under
control.
To conclude, the record evidence leaves me with no doubt or concern about
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. I am persuaded that
Applicant acted in a reasonable and responsible way in dealing with financial problems
after a lengthy period of unemployment. His overall financial situation is improving. In
reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the
favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I gave due

consideration to the whole-person concept.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant40
mitigated the financial considerations concern.
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.j: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the interests of
national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information.
