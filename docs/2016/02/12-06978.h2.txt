  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security
Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition, because the SOR
was issued after September 1, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access
to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, then made
effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They supersede or replace
the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Remand Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
This is a security clearance case  in which the Appeal Board remanded for1
further processing.  In my initial November 21, 2015 decision I concluded that Applicant2
had a history of financial problems or difficulties consisting of about $27,000 in unpaid
judgments or collection accounts, which were largely unresolved and ongoing. I then
concluded she did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, extenuate, mitigate, or
explain her problematic financial history and decided the case against her. 
 Exhibits A, B, and C. 3
2
The Appeal Board remanded the case because Applicant made a timely post-
hearing submission of seven documents that were not included in the record for my
consideration. I did not consider those matters because they were not forwarded to me
by Department Counsel, which is disappointing, to put it mildly. In its remand order, the
Appeal Board directed me to consider the post-hearing documents and then issue a
new decision. Before addressing the merits of the case, a couple of procedural matters
are in order.   
First, the ruling on procedure, findings of fact, law and policies, and discussion as
set forth in my initial November 21, 2015 decision are incorporated by reference and will
not be repeated here. As a result, it is necessary to read this remand decision together
with the initial decision to have a complete understanding of the case.  
Second, Applicant’s post-hearing submission consists of the following documents
that are made part of the record as follows: Exhibit D–performance evaluations from
2012, 2013, and 2014; Exhibit E–case papers and correspondence concerning the
judgment in SOR ¶ 1.a; Exhibit F–one-page letter concerning the collection account in
SOR ¶ 1.f; Exhibit G–one-page letter concerning the collection account in SOR ¶ 1.d;
and Exhibit H–one-page letter concerning the collection account in SOR ¶ 1.i. In
addition to those seven documents, Department Counsel forwarded a letter from
Applicant, received at DOHA on January 28, 2016, which is made part of the record as
Exhibit I. I have reviewed these documents and conclude it is not necessary to reopen
the hearing for further testimony from Applicant. 
Findings of Fact
Turning to the merits, the central finding of fact from my initial decision was that
Applicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties consisting of three unpaid
judgments for a total of $13,544 and six collection accounts ranging in amounts from
$404 to $9,843 for a total of about $14,035. I found that the collection account in SOR ¶
1.h was the same as the unpaid judgment in SOR ¶ 1.b, and resolved SOR ¶ 1.h in
Applicant’s favor based on the duplication. In addition, I found that Applicant presented
documentary proof of the following: (1) she settled the $669 collection account in SOR ¶
1.f for $221 in June 2014; (2) she settled the $629 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.d for
$100 in February 2012; and (3) she paid a $90 medical collection account, not alleged
in the SOR, in July 2015.  Otherwise, I found that she had no documentary evidence3
that the remaining delinquent accounts in the SOR were paid, settled, in repayment, in
dispute, cancelled, forgiven, or otherwise resolved.  
Based on Applicant’s post-hearing exhibits, several additional findings of fact are
appropriate. Those findings are described below.
 Exhibit E at 4, Exhibit I, and Exhibit 4 at 7.4
 Exhibit A. 5
 Exhibit B. 6

First, based on Exhibit D, Applicant has a good record of employment. She
received favorable performance evaluations with overall ratings of far exceeds
expectations for both 2012 and 2013, and consistently exceeds expectations for 2014.
Second, based on Exhibit E, Applicant continues to remain indebted for the
unpaid judgment of $7,375 in SOR ¶ 1.a. The court papers show it was a default
judgment based on Applicant’s failure to answer the complaint. She was notified of the
judgment by letter, dated February 24, 2010. The amount owed is likely higher due to
post-judgment interest. But Exhibit E also establishes that the $9,843 collection account
in SOR ¶ 1.e is a duplication of the unpaid judgment in SOR ¶ 1.a, based on the
matching account number of 33776060.  Accordingly, SOR ¶ 1.e is resolved in4
Applicant’s favor based on the duplication. 
Third, Exhibit F is an additional letter concerning the $669 collection account in
SOR ¶ 1.f, which I previously found Applicant had settled for $221 in June 2014.5
Fourth, Exhibit G is an additional letter concerning the $629 collection account in
SOR ¶ 1.d, which I previously found Applicant had settled for $100 in February 2012.6
Fifth, based on Exhibit H, Applicant settled the $404 collection account in SOR ¶
1.i for $161 in August 2015, which is after the hearing in this case took place.
Based on the above, Applicant’s post-hearing documents establish the following
additional facts: (1) she has a good record of employment; (2) she favorably resolved
the collection account in ¶ 1.e based on duplication; and (3) she favorably resolved the
collection account in SOR ¶ 1.i by settlement. 
The following delinquent debts are unresolved: (1) the unpaid judgment for
$7,375 in SOR ¶ 1.a; (2) the unpaid judgment for $1,084 in SOR ¶ 1.b; (3) the unpaid
judgment for $5,085 in SOR ¶ 1.c; and (4) the collection account for $1,749 in SOR ¶
1.g. Those four delinquent debts total about $15,293 (the total is likely higher due to
post-judgment interest), and Applicant is not taking active efforts to resolve them. Of the
nine delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, two are resolved for Applicant based on
duplication and three are resolved for Applicant based on settlements for lesser
amounts by paying a total of about $482. In addition, she paid a $90 medical collection
account not alleged in the SOR.  
In Exhibit I, Applicant takes issue with my treatment of more than $70,000 in
consumer debt she incurred, with her fiancé, in 2014–2015 to buy two used but high-
end automobiles and an engagement ring. She asserts that she is only responsible for
 Exhibit 5 at 2-3 and 6, listed at trade lines 3, 16, and 18. Because those accounts are current and were not7
alleged in the SOR, I did not consider them for purposes of disqualification. But I did consider them as an
example of Applicant failing to prioritize repayment of delinquent debt, which does not bode well for her
security suitability. There is a fuller discussion of these matters in my initial decision.

her automobile loan, which had a high credit of $29,597. Her assertion is not supported
by the evidence. A July 2015 credit report shows that she is individually or jointly
responsible for all three accounts.  She did not present documentary information from7
the creditors to rebut the information in the credit report.  
Discussion
I have given due consideration to Applicant’s post-hearing exhibits, and it is
apparent that her situation is not as dire as described in my initial decision. But her post-
hearing documents do not justify a different outcome under Guideline F.8
With that said, Applicant receives some credit, under the mitigating condition at
AG ¶ 20(d), for initiating a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors based on settling
three collection accounts for lesser amounts for a total of about $482. The credit in
mitigation is limited, however, because $482 is a small fraction of the delinquent debt.
The credit is also limited because she has taken no action to address the three unpaid
judgments and a collection account for a total of about $15,293.   
Applicant’s problematic financial history continues to date. The evidence does not
support a conclusion that she has established a plan and taken steps to implement that
plan sufficient to mitigate the concern. The payments she has made to date are too
minor to establish a track record of progress showing a favorable upward trend. Instead,
the available evidence shows that Applicant’s problematic financial history is ongoing,
as it has been for many years. Her record of good employment is noteworthy. But it is
insufficient to mitigate the concern about her longstanding history of financial problems.
Accordingly, I conclude that she did not meet her ultimate burden of persuasion to show
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to
classified information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.a: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.b: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.c: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.d: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.e: For Applicant
5
Subparagraph 1.f: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.g: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.h For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.i: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
