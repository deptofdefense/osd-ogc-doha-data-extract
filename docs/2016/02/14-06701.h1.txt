Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny her eligibility for
access to classified information via a security clearance. Applicant presented sufficient
evidence to explain and mitigate the concern stemming from her history of financial
problems. Applicant did not deliberately omit, conceal, or falsify relevant facts about her
financial history when she completed a security clearance application in May 2014.
Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on May 21, 2014.  About a year later on June 25, 2015, after1
reviewing the application and information gathered during a background investigation,
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

the Department of Defense (DOD)  sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR),2
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant her eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to a3
complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action under the security guidelines known as
Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline E for personal conduct. Applicant
answered the SOR in a July 27, 2015 response consisting of a two-page memorandum.
Neither Applicant nor Department Counsel requested a hearing, and so, the case
will be decided on the written record.  On September 9, 2015, Department Counsel4
submitted all relevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing.  This5
so-called file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant, who received it on
September 29, 2015. Applicant replied in a timely manner and submitted a four-page
memorandum along with seven enclosures. Those matters are admitted as Exhibit A.
The case was assigned to me on December 1, 2015.    
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 41-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security
clearance. She first received a security clearance in about 2003.  She is employed as a6
contracts manager for a large company in the defense industry. Her annual salary
exceeds $100,000 based on biweekly pay of $4,499.  Income tax records show she7
earned wages of $70,114 in 2012, $123,004 in 2013, and $95,382 in 2014.  She has8
had this particular job since relocating to her state of current residence in January 2013.
She has worked for the same company since 2002.  Before that, she attended college9
 Exhibits 3 and 4. 10
 Exhibit A at Enclosure 1. 11
 Exhibit 5 at 13–1412
 Exhibit 9. 13
 Exhibit 4. 14

while employed during 1997–2002, earning a bachelor’s degree in 2002.  She obtained10
a divorce from her husband in 2011,  and she has two teenage children at home. 11
Applicant has a history of financial problems, which she does not dispute. The
SOR contains 15 factual allegations that fall into three groups: (1) bankruptcy cases; (2)
ordinary collection accounts; and (3) student loan accounts. Applicant’s answer to the
SOR was mixed, containing admissions, denials, and brief  explanations. Before
addressing those matters, the origin of Applicant’s financial difficulties is addressed.
1. Applicant’s financial difficulties began during her marriage  
Applicant addressed the reasons for her financial difficulties during her 2014
background investigation.  In 2004, she and her then husband had full-time12
employment with good salaries, and they were rebuilding their credit after a 1998
Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. In early 2005, her husband left his job with a firm and
became self-employed. He established his business and did reasonably well until an
economic downturn severely affected his business. He became depressed and did not
receive appropriate medical care. He stayed at home and refused to look for work or
take any type of job. 
They liquidated assets (e.g., 401(k) accounts and personal property) to pay the
mortgage loan, bills, and other living expenses and were living month-to-month on
Applicant’s salary. In time, this situation resulted in Applicant using her employer’s credit
card to pay for personal expenses such as buying food. She and her husband sought
relief from their indebtedness by a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, which was filed in
December 2008. As noted below, the Chapter 13 case was voluntary dismissed by
Applicant and her husband in 2010 when he refused to help make the monthly payment.
 
2. The bankruptcy cases
Applicant’s financial problems date back to about 1998, when she and her then
husband sought relief from indebtedness under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case.  She13
was then about 23 years old, employed as an administrative assistant, and attending
college. She disclosed the bankruptcy in her 2003 security clearance application,
indicating it involved about $10,000 of debt.  During a 2004 background investigation,14
she explained the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case was due to premarital credit card debt
they were unable to repay after they married and both were pursuing college degrees

while working low-paying jobs.  The bankruptcy case was successfully concluded in15
December 1998 when the bankruptcy court issued the discharge order.16
About ten years later in 2008, Applicant and her then husband sought relief from
indebtedness under a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, often referred to as a wage-earner
payment plan.  The case was filed in December 2008, when Applicant was working for17
her current employer, albeit at a different location than today. 
The Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was dismissed in September 2010 on the
motion of Applicant and her then husband. They took that action due to ongoing marital
troubles and her husband’s refusal to share in the monthly bankruptcy payment.
Applicant did not believe it was fair for her to make the entire monthly payment when
her husband had incurred the majority of the debt.  When her husband refused to18
share in the monthly payment, they decided to dismiss the bankruptcy case and
address their indebtedness in their divorce.  19
3. The collection accounts
The SOR alleges six ordinary collections for a total of about $2,580. Based on
my review of the available evidence, the six collection accounts are unresolved.
The first account, in SOR ¶ 1.c, is a $186 collection account for television
service. She denies this debt on the basis that she returned the equipment to the
television service company when she terminated service and received a refund.  She20
intends to dispute the debt.
The second, in SOR ¶ 1.f, is a $117 collection account for television service with
a different firm. She neither admitted nor denied this debt, explaining that she needed to
contact the television service company as she believed she had taken care of the
account when she relocated in 2013.  Her plan is to work on this account after21
December 2015, when she has sufficient cash flow to address it.22

The third, in SOR ¶ 1.g, is a $144 collection account stemming from a gym
membership. She explained that it was a corporate membership that was supposed to
cancel once she no longer lived within a certain distance of a gym.  She cancelled the23
membership after her relocation in 2013, and she will dispute this account. 
The fourth, in SOR ¶ 1.h, is a $129 collection account for a utility service. She
neither admitted nor denied this debt, explaining that she needed to contact the
collection firm as she believes she had taken care of the account when she relocated in
2013.  Her plan is to work on this account after December 2015, when she has24
sufficient cash flow to address it.  Likewise, she has the same plan for the fifth account,25
in SOR ¶ 1.j, which is a $1,342 collection account.  26
And the sixth, in SOR ¶ 1.o, is a $662 collection account stemming from a credit
card account issued by a bank. Applicant believes this account was paid or resolved
during the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case.  But a June 2014 credit report, which was27
obtained during the background investigation, shows otherwise.  Page five of the credit28
report shows the account (with account number last four 8789) as a collection account
with the original creditor, and the account was charged off, closed, and purchased by
another lender. Then at page nine of the credit report, the account (with account
number last four 8789) is listed with a collection agency with a balance of $662, and the
account was open as of May 2014.  
4. The student loan accounts
The SOR alleges seven student loan accounts, five of which are more than 120
or 180 days past due, and two of which are in collection. Several of the past-due
accounts were transferred and consolidated with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.i, which is in
collection. Applicant presented documentary evidence that she is paying a total of $823
biweekly, by wage withholding or garnishment orders, for two student loans accounts in
SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.k.  She explained that she decided to not contest  the orders because29
it was the right thing to do to pay off the loans. As of October 15, 2015, Applicant had
paid about $5,330.  The individual student loans are discussed further below.30

The past-due student loan in SOR ¶ 1.d is alleged without an amount past due.
Applicant explained this account was transferred and consolidated with the creditor in
SOR ¶ 1.i.  The June 2014 credit report describes the account (account number last31
four 6420) as a deferred student loan that had been 180 days past due with a past-due
balance of $81 and no balance due.  The report also states a claim was filed by the32
government for the insured portion of the balance of the loan, and it was last reported
delinquent in August 2009.
The past-due student loan in SOR ¶ 1.e is alleged without an amount past due.
Applicant explained this account was transferred and consolidated with the creditor in
SOR ¶ 1.i.  The June 2014 credit report describes the account (account number last33
four 6421) as a deferred student loan that had been 180 days past due with a past-due
balance of $112 and no balance due.  The report also states a claim was filed by the34
government for the insured portion of the balance of the loan, and it was last reported
delinquent in August 2009.
The past-due student loan in SOR ¶ 1.l is alleged without an amount past due.
Applicant explained this account was transferred and consolidated with the creditor in
SOR ¶ 1.i.  The June 2014 credit report describes the account (account number last35
four 3641) as a deferred student loan that was current but had been 120 days past due
with a past-due balance of $0 and a balance due of $0.  The report also states the36
account was closed. 
The past-due student loan in SOR ¶ 1.m is alleged without an amount past due.
Applicant explained this account was transferred and consolidated with the creditor in
SOR ¶ 1.i.  The June 2014 credit report describes the account (account number last37
four 2674) as a deferred student loan that had been 180 days past due with a past-due
balance of $0 and a balance due of $0.  The report also states the account was closed38
and that it had been transferred to another office.

The past-due student loan in SOR ¶ 1.n is alleged as $3,987 past due. Applicant
explained this account is currently paid by interception of any income tax refunds, and
she is not in a financial position at this time to make monthly payments through a loan-
rehabilitation program.  The June 2014 credit report describes the account (account39
number last four 8581) as a deferred student loan that had been 180 days past due with
a past-due balance of $565 and a balance of $3,987.  Applicant further explained that40
the IRS intercepted federal income tax refunds of $3,676 and $209 for tax years 2012
and 2013.41
The student loan in SOR ¶1.i is alleged as a collection account for $45,718, and
that allegation is supported by the June 2014 credit report.  The account became42
subject to an order of withholding of earnings in about July 2015.  The balance at that43
time was about $49,806, which is being paid at the rate of $352 biweekly.  As of44
October 15, 2015, she had $1,056 withheld from her wages for payment.   45
The student loan in SOR ¶ 1.k is alleged as a collection account for $5,095, and
that allegation is supported by the June 2014 credit report.  The account became46
subject to a wage garnishment order in about April 2015.  The balance at that time was47
about $6,380, which is being paid at the rate of $471 biweekly.  Applicant estimates48
that she will pay off this account by December 2015.  As of October 15, 2015, she had49
$4,273 withheld from her wages for payment.    50

5. Applicant’s May 2014 security clearance application
In May 2014, Applicant completed a security clearance application as part of a
periodic reinvestigation.  In doing so, she was required to disclose information about51
her background, including her financial record in Section 26 of the application. She in
artfully disclosed the 2008 Chapter 13 bankruptcy case; she checked the box indicating
she had not filed a petition for bankruptcy in the last seven years; but she then stated
that she and her husband had filed a Chapter 13 case that was subsequently dismissed
(she used the incorrect term discharged), because her husband would not agree to pay
half of the required monthly payment. But she did not disclose the collection accounts or
student loan accounts, discussed above, in response to the relevant question.
Applicant has explained, during her background investigation, in response to the
SOR, and in response to the FORM, that she did not deliberately omit, conceal, or
falsify her security clearance application when she failed to report her delinquent
collection and student loan accounts. During her background investigation, she stated
that she believed “no” was the correct answer to the various question about delinquent
accounts because she had not reviewed a credit report or conducted any research.52
She acknowledged that she should have answered the question in the affirmative. 
In her answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that she did not deliberately falsify
her security clearance application. She explained that she disclosed the Chapter 13
bankruptcy case and the reason for the dismissal as well as the fact that she answered
all the questions put to her during the background investigation. She further explained
that she may have misunderstood the questions or did not read the questions
completely because she was interrupted repeatedly when she was completing the
application during normal business hours.
In her response to the FORM, Applicant stated that she did not deliberately omit
information about her delinquent accounts.  She explained that she was interrupted53
repeatedly when she was working on the application and was under time pressure to
complete it. She explained that she had not obtained and reviewed a credit report
before completing the application, which she should have done, and she considered it a
lesson learned for the future. She further explained that she worked hard to complete
the application and reported everything that she could recall at the time.  
 
In addition to the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, Applicant disclosed that she had
violated the terms of use for her employer’s business credit card by charging personal
expenses of about $2,400 in 2012, which she repaid by payroll withholding before she

relocated in 2013.  She addressed this matter further in her background investigation,54
her answer to the SOR, and in her response to the FORM.  She acknowledged that the55
credit card was intended to be used for business travel expenses, but it was a common
and accepted practice in the small office in which she worked to use the credit card for
personal expenses so long as the monthly bill was paid in full. She was then transferred
to another office where the formal policy was adhered to and she ran afoul of it when
her account became delinquent. She received a written notice of violation from her
employer and was required to repay the money by payroll withholding. 
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As56
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt57
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An58
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  59
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting60
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An61
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate62

burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme63
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.64
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.65
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it66
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline E for personal conduct,  the suitability of an applicant may be67
questioned or put into doubt when an applicant engages in conduct involving
questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with the
rules and regulations. And “of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and
candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate
with the security clearance process.”68
Addressing Applicant’s violation of her employer’s travel policy first, she engaged
in misconduct when she charged personal expenses to her business credit card
account, which is a concern.  She was discovered and held accountable for the69
violation in 2012, which was nearly four years ago. Contributing to the violation was her
belief that the conduct in question was a common and accepted practice. There have
been no subsequent violations. For all those reasons, the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a is
decided for Applicant. 
 AG ¶¶ 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 70
 ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that “the security suitability of an applicant71
is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness or recurring
financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In
security clearance cases, “the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances
surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation
omitted). 
 AG ¶ 18.  72
 AG ¶ 19(a) and (c). 73
11
Addressing Applicant’s failure to fully disclose her adverse financial history on her
May 2014 security clearance application, I am not persuaded her failure was deliberate.
She provided a sufficient explanation to persuade me that her omission of the collection
accounts and delinquent student loans was inadvertent and unintentional, and not an
attempt to hide or conceal her negative financial history. She in fact disclosed the
Chapter 13 bankruptcy case and the travel policy violation, both of which are quite
negative matters. Her willingness to disclose those matters undercuts the allegation that
she was attempting to conceal the delinquent accounts. For all those reasons, the
allegation in SOR ¶ 2.b is decided for Applicant. 
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant70
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 71
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  72
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly compromise
classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It encompasses
concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important qualities. A
person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or
negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial
history within the meaning of Guideline F.  That history goes back to the 1998 Chapter73
7 bankruptcy case, but the most relevant matters are the more recent events. The
significance of the 1998 Chapter 7 bankruptcy case is minimal, because it occurred
about 18 years ago when Applicant was only 23 years old, and she and her husband
were recently married college students with low-paying jobs. But the same cannot be
said for the more recent events, which include the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, the
collection accounts, and the delinquent student loan accounts. 
 AG ¶ 20(a)–(f).74
12
 In mitigation, I have considered the six mitigating conditions under Guideline F.74
The following mitigating conditions are most pertinent: 
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or death, divorce, or
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances;
and 
AG ¶ 20(c) . . .  there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control. 
Applicant’s problematic financial history is due to her marital troubles, which
includes her then husband’s lack of employment due to a business downturn, his
depression, and his refusal to make a meaningful contribution to the family’s financial
well being. The situation came to a head during 2010–2011, when Applicant  had the
Chapter 13 bankruptcy case dismissed and she then obtained a divorce from her
husband. She acted responsibly under quite difficult circumstances by maintaining her
employment, caring for her two children, and eventually obtaining her current position
with the company, which required a relocation of some distance. Although she has not
resolved the six collection accounts, those debts are a relatively small sum of money
(less than $3,000 in total). And she has made progress in addressing the student loan
accounts. Those are not the actions of an irresponsible person who is ignoring her
financial obligations. 
In addition, there are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are
being resolved, albeit slowly. Starting with the student loan accounts, which I consider
to be high priority debt, Applicant is making progress to resolve those accounts. First,
four of the past-due student loans alleged in the SOR are of little significance, because
they have essentially no or $0 balances and are described as deferred student loans
that were past due (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 1.l, and 1.m). Those circumstances tend to
support Applicant’s explanation that those accounts were transferred and consolidated
with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.i, which would explain the balance of nearly $50,000 for that
student loan account. 
Second, Applicant presented documentary evidence that she is paying a total of
$823 biweekly, by wage withholding or garnishment orders, for two student loans
accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.k. As of October 15, 2015, Applicant had paid about
$5,330, and the student loan account in SOR ¶ 1.k has probably been paid off by now. 
Third, the past-due student loan in SOR ¶ 1.n is currently paid through
withholding of income tax refunds. This situation is likely to change as more cash
becomes available with the payoff of the student loan account in SOR ¶ 1.k. The
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).75
13
additional cash flow should allow Applicant to begin to make some progress in
addressing the unresolved collection accounts as well. 
Overall, the evidence is sufficient to explain and mitigate the concern stemming
from Applicant’s problematic financial history. Her financial problems were largely due to
her marital troubles, which ended with a divorce in 2011. Like many people in that
situation, it is taking time for her to recover fully from that setback. Nevertheless, she did
not give up or quit, she is making progress, and she has a good-paying job that will
allow her to continue doing so. 
The concerns over Applicant’s personal conduct and financial history do not
create doubt about her current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to
protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a
whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or
vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I75
conclude that she met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified
information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.o: For Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline E: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 2.a–2.b: For Applicant
