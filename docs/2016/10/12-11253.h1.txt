HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges six delinquent debts totaling 
$18,589. He paid three debts; he is making payments to address one debt; one creditor 
has agreed that the debt is resolved; and he is negotiating a settlement of one debt in 
good faith. He made sufficient progress resolving his delinquent debts, and financial 
considerations security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 8, 2012, Applicant signed and submitted an Electronic Questionnaires 
for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security clearance application (SF 86) 
(SCA). (GE 1) On April 26, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 
(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 
20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information 
(AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(HE 2) The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to find that it is clearly 
consistent with national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s access to classified 
information and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether 
Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2)  
 
On July 17, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing. (HE 3) On October 16, 2015, Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. 
On October 21, 2015, the case was assigned to another administrative judge. On June 
7, 2016, the case was transferred to me. On July 7, 2016, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a hearing notice setting the hearing for July 18, 
2016. Applicant waived his right to 15 days of notice of the date, time, and place of the 
hearing. (Transcript (Tr.) 15-16). Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled using video 
teleconference. Department Counsel offered five exhibits into evidence, and Applicant 
offered six exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 10-13, 18-19, 43-44; GE 1-5; AE A-F) All exhibits 
were admitted into evidence without objection. (Tr. 17-19, 43-44) On July 26, 2016, 
DOHA received the transcript of the hearing. On September 19, 2016, I received one 
additional exhibit, which was admitted without objection. (AE G)  
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all SOR allegations. He also provided 
extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings 
of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 58-year-old chief engineering officer. (Tr. 21; AE G) He has worked 
for the same employer since October 2011. (GE 1) He has not attended school in the 
previous 10 years. (GE 1) He served in the Navy from 1983 to 1989, and he received an 
honorable discharge. (Tr. 22-23) His Navy specialty was air conditioning and 
refrigeration. (Tr. 22)  
 
In 1992, Applicant married, and in May 2012, his divorce was final. (Tr. 8, 47; AE 
B) His six children were born in 1992, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2003. (Tr. 23, 44; 
GE 1) He received custody of his children in the divorce, and four of his children live 
with Applicant. (Tr. 23, 44) His other two children attend college. (Tr. 44) He provides 
some financial support for one of his children attending college. (Tr. 49) Applicant 
received several awards from his employer. (Tr. 25; AE G at 1) There is no evidence of 
security violations, felony-level arrests or convictions, or abuse of illegal drugs. (GE 1; 
GE 2)     
 
                                            
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, SOR 
response, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (OPM 
PSI), hearing transcript, and hearing exhibits.3 From 1997 to 2002, Applicant worked for 
a large corporation. In September 2002, Applicant’s employer went bankrupt. (Tr. 26) 
From September 2002 to January 2004, Applicant was unemployed. (Tr. 27) From 
January 2004 to May 2005, he was employed. From May 2005 to May 2006, he was 
unemployed. (Tr. 27-28) From May 2006 to September 2008, he was employed. He 
was unemployed from September 2008 to May 2009. (Tr. 28) From May 2009 to May 
2010, he was employed. From May 2010 to October 2011, he was unemployed.  
 
Applicant first learned of the SOR debts during his OPM PSI, and he was 
reminded of the SOR debts when he received the SOR. (Tr. 47; GE 2) His monthly 
salary after deductions is $3,600. (Tr. 49) The primary reason for his financial problems 
is unemployment. (Tr. 50)  
 
Before his divorce, his spouse was primarily responsible for paying their debts. 
(Tr. 24) When Applicant was divorced, the two debts resulting from repossessed 
vehicles in 2009 were not allocated in the divorce decree because Applicant was not 
aware of them. (Tr. 58) He does not receive any financial support from his former 
spouse even though he has custody of their children. (Tr. 45)  
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $18,589, and their status is 
as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a is a charged-off bank debt for $8,726. In 2006, Applicant purchased a 
used vehicle, and his spouse made payments on the vehicle lien from 2006 to January 
2009. (Tr. 33) In April 2009, the vehicle was repossessed by the lien holder. (Tr. 34)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b is a collection debt for $8,580. In 2006, Applicant purchased a used 
vehicle, and his spouse made payments on it from 2006 until February 2009. (Tr. 35) In 
June 2009, the creditor repossessed the vehicle. (Tr. 35)    
 
Applicant’s spouse was making payments on the debts, and he presumed she 
continued to make payments until they were auctioned. (Tr. 46) He was not notified of 
the auctioning of the vehicles or of the deficiency owed after the auction. (Tr. 46-47) The 
creditors for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b did not seek a judgment to obtain payment 
from Applicant. (Tr. 36) The most recent credit report Department Counsel submitted 
was dated September 8, 2015, and the only delinquent debt listed was the debt in SOR 
¶ 1.b for $8,580. (GE 3)   
 
In August 2016, Applicant’s counsel contacted the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.a to 
determine how much the creditor wanted to settle the debt. (AE G) The creditor 
                                            
3Applicant’s record of employment and periods of unemployment are detailed in his SCA and AE 
B.

responded that due to the state statute of limitations, the creditor was not interested in 
being paid anything to settle the debt. (AE G) In this case, the state statute of limitations 
is five years for vehicle purchase contracts. (HE 3) In August 2016, Applicant’s counsel 
contacted the collection agent in SOR ¶ 1.b to ascertain how much the creditor wanted 
to settle the debt; the creditor responded 50 percent of $8,580; and Applicant’s counsel 
counter-offered 10 percent of $8,580. (AE G) Applicant’s counsel sent a follow-up letter 
in which he asked the creditor to provide a reasonable counter offer, and he is awaiting 
the creditor’s response. (AE G)    
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d are medical collection debts for $563 and $488 being 
collected by the same creditor. One account has a zero balance, and he has a payment 
plan for the second account. (Tr. 39; AE F) He began making monthly $100 payments in 
March 2016, and he provided proof of $100 payments on May 23, 2016, June 20, 2016, 
and July 15, 2016. (Tr. 31-32, 45; AE C) The debt will be paid in October 2016. (Tr. 45)  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f are collection debts for $57 and $175 being collected by the 
same creditor. On June 25, 2015, he paid the two debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f. (Tr. 30-
31; AE A) On June 25, 2015, he also paid an additional debt to the same creditor for 
$155. (AE A)   
 
In August 2012, Applicant received financial counseling from a Dave Ramsey 
course. (Tr. 36-37; AE B; AE G) His three April 5, 2016 credit bureaus report provided 
scores of “beacon” 750, “classic” 736, and “fair” 673. (Tr. 38; AE F at 1; AE G at 3) His 
April 5, 2016 credit reports show a zero past due on all accounts, and all accounts are 
current. He purchased a home, and he has a $300,000 mortgage with a $1,900 
payment, which is current. (Tr. 40) Applicant did not make a down payment on his 
home, and the loan was guaranteed by the Department of Veteran’s Affairs. (Tr. 49) 
The Applicant believes he has sufficient income to maintain his accounts in current 
status. (Tr. 42)  
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865. 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this 
decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, SOR response, OPM PSI, hearing transcript, and hearing exhibits. The 
Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring 
additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;4 and 
                                            
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. Applicant’s SOR alleges six delinquent 
debts totaling $18,589. He paid three SOR debts; he is making payments to address 
one SOR debt, and it will be paid in October 2016; one SOR debt is resolved because 
the creditor has elected not to accept payments; and he is negotiating a settlement of 
one debt in good faith.  
 
Several circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his finances. 
Applicant was unemployed as follows: from September 2002 to January 2004; from May 
2005 to May 2006; from September 2008 to May 2009; and from May 2010 to October 
2011. He relied on his spouse to pay their debts, and she allowed several accounts to 
become delinquent. In 2012, he was divorced, and he has four children living at home. 
His net monthly income is $3,900. He acted responsibly to address his delinquent SOR 
debts considering his limited income and his family responsibilities.       
 
Applicant’s 2015 and 2016 credit reports show all of his debts are current except 
for one debt under collection; however, the fact “that some debts have dropped off 
[Applicant’s] credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution.” ISCR Case No. 
14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative 
financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency or the 
                                                                                                                                            
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is 
longer.5 In this case, Applicant’s excellent 2016 credit report shows his two vehicle 
repossession debts are so stale they have been dropped from his credit report, and he 
has a strong track record of debt payment after he divorced and took over responsibility 
for paying the family debts.  
 
All states have statutes of limitations upon collectability of debts, which range 
from three to six years for contract-based vehicle loans. In this case, the state statute of 
limitations is five years. State statutes of limitations clearly and unequivocally end a 
creditor’s legal responsibility to pay the creditor after the passage of a certain amount of 
time, as specified in state law. In this case, the creditors could have preserved these 
two debts by obtaining judgments against Applicant; however, there is no evidence that 
either of the two creditors took judicial action to pursue collection of these two debts.6  
 
In a series of decisions the Appeal Board has rejected statutes of limitations for 
debts generated through contracts, which is the law in all 50 states, as significantly 
mitigating financial considerations concerns under AG ¶ 20(d). See ISCR Case No. 08-
01122 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 
2008); ADP Case No. 07-13041 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-
11814 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2008) ADP Case No. 06-14616 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 
2007) (stating, “reliance upon legal defenses such as the statute of limitations does not 
necessarily demonstrate prudence, honesty, and reliability; therefore, such reliance is of 
diminished probative value in resolving trustworthiness concerns arising out of financial 
problems. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).”). 
 
Recently, the DOHA Appeal Board reinforced its position on statutes of 
limitations not mitigating financial considerations concerns stating: 
                                            
5 Title 15 U.S.C. § 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit 
Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-
reporting-act.pdf.  
 
6The South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of 
application of the statute of limitations: 
 
Statutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they 
stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and stability 
to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of limitations is 
the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes 
of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, 
they will not be [haled] into court to defend time-barred claims. Moreover, limitations 
periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights. Statutes of limitations are, indeed, 
fundamental to our judicial system. 
   
Carolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. Ct. App. 2005) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). South Carolina case law is not binding on state courts 
outside of South Carolina. However, the South Carolina Court of Appeals’ description of the basis for this 
long-standing legal doctrine is instructive. See also Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 
485 U.S. 478, 486 (1988) (stating “The State’s interest in a self-executing statute of limitations is in 
providing repose for potential defendants and in avoiding stale claims.”).

In this case, the Judge noted that Applicant explained that he did not owe 
any of the alleged debts because they had either been deleted from his 
credit report or soon would be deleted, and he also relied on a state 
statute of limitations to absolve himself of debts. The Appeal Board has 
long recognized that debts remain relevant for security clearance 
purposes even if they are no longer enforceable due to the running of the 
statute of limitations or cannot be legally listed on a credit report due to the 
passage of time. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04779 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 
20, 2005) and ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct 26, 2006).7 We 
also have held that reliance on a state’s statute of limitations does not 
constitute a good-faith effort to resolve financial difficulties and is of limited 
mitigative value. ADP Case No. 06-18900 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 03-04779 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2005) and ISCR 
Case No. 01-09691 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003)). 
 
ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016). 
 
Applicant’s counsel’s statement that the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.a will not accept 
payment is credible, and that debt is resolved.8 Applicant has reasonably attempted to 
negotiate a settlement of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b, and he is negotiating in good faith.  
 
Based on Applicant’s credible and sincere promise to pay his debts and his track 
record of paying his debts, future new delinquent debt “is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on [Applicant’s] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” and 
“there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” His 
payments of his debts showed good faith. He has sufficient income to keep his debts in 
current status and to continue making progress paying his remaining debts. I am 
confident that Applicant will conscientiously endeavor to maintain his financial 
responsibility. His efforts are sufficient to mitigate financial considerations security 
concerns. Even if financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated under 
Guideline F, they are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
                                            
7Compare ISCR Case No. 12-04806 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2014). In that case, Applicant corroborated 
efforts to settle debts that were in “charged-off” status. Also, that Applicant had received financial 
counseling. Ultimately, the Board affirmed the Judge’s favorable decision.

http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/statute-of-limitations-state-laws-chart-29941.html. According to 
the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Information webpage, it is illegal under the Fair Debt 
Collection Practices Act for a creditor to threaten to sue to collect a time-barred debt.

(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 58-year-old chief engineering officer, who has worked for the same 
employer since October 2011. He served in the Navy from 1983 to 1989, and he 
received an honorable discharge. His Navy specialty was air conditioning and 
refrigeration. In 1992, Applicant married, and in May 2012, his divorce was final. Four of 
his children currently live with Applicant. He provides some financial support for one of 
his children attending college. Applicant received several awards from his employer. 
There is no evidence of security violations, felony-level arrests or convictions, or abuse 
of illegal drugs. He is sufficiently mature to conscientiously comply with his security 
responsibilities.    
 
Applicant’s delinquent debts were caused by reliance on his spouse to pay their 
debts, her failure to pay their debts, his repeated periods of unemployment, and divorce. 
After he became fully employed, and his divorce was final, he resumed debt payments. 
Applicant’s SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $18,589. He paid three SOR 
debts; he is making payments to address one SOR debt, and it will be paid in October 
2016; one SOR debt is resolved because the creditor has elected not to accept 
payments; and he is negotiating a settlement of one debt in good faith. His 2016 credit 
report shows all debts are in current status. He is communicating with his creditors and 
assures he intends to pay his debts. He understands the conduct required to retain his 
security clearance. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-
person analysis in financial cases stating: 
  
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence 
of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant 
is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted). Applicant has established a “meaningful track record” of debt 
re-payment, and I am confident he will maintain his financial responsibility.9 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations concerns are mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

9The Government has the option of following-up with more questions about Applicant’s finances. 
The Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit reports, 
investigation, and interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the Government from 
subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the security 
significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative security 
significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). An administrative judge does not 
have “authority to grant an interim, conditional, or probationary clearance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 
(App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR 
Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006) (stating, “The Board has no authority to grant 
[a]pplicant a conditional or probationary security clearance to allow her the opportunity to have a security 
clearance while she works on her financial problems.”). This footnote does not imply that this decision to 
grant Applicant’s security clearance is conditional.
