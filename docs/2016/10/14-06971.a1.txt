APPEAL BOARD SUMMARY DISPOSITION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June
15, 2015, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision
on the written record.  On July 12, 2016, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings
and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert J. Tuider denied Applicant’s request for a
security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant’s brief makes no assertion of harmful error.  Rather, it contains new evidence
about his automobile debt and another small debt.  We cannot consider new evidence on appeal. 
Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  Even if Applicant had made a timely submission of the things he includes in
his brief, it would not likely have made a difference in the Judge’s overall decision, which relied 
on a paucity of mitigating evidence regarding Applicant’s financial situation as a whole.  Our
authority is limited to cases in which the appealing party has raised an issue of harmful error.  See,
e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05468 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2016).  Accordingly, the Judge’s Decision is
AFFIRMED.
