HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state tax returns from 2008 through 
2011. By the time of his hearing, he had generated all required tax returns, and he did 
not owe any taxes; however, a track record of timely filing of tax returns is necessary to 
fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Access to classified information 
is denied.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On October 30, 2012, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On February 25, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to 
Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, 
February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
 
2 
                                         
 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial 
considerations guideline. 
 
Applicant provided an undated response to the SOR. On May 5, 2016, 
Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On May 19, 2016, the case was assigned 
to another administrative judge, and on August 4, 2016, it was transferred to me. On 
August 30, 2016, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice 
of hearing, setting the hearing for September 16, 2016. (HE 1) The hearing was held as 
scheduled.  
  
Department Counsel offered four exhibits; Applicant offered six exhibits; and all 
proffered exhibits were admitted without objection. (Tr. 11-12; GE 1-4; Applicant 
Exhibits (AE) A-F) On September 27, 2016, DOHA received a copy of the transcript of 
the hearing. On October 4, 2016, Applicant provided 16 post-hearing exhibits, which 
were admitted without objection. (AE G-BB) The record closed on October 4, 2016. (Tr. 
28) 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations. He also 
provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted 
as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 39 years old, and he has worked for the same employer since 2001. 
(Tr. 13, 15; GE 1) He is a senior software engineer. (Tr. 15) He has never married, and 
he has a 20-month-old son. (Tr. 14; GE 1) In 2002, he received a bachelor’s degree 
with a major in computer science. (Tr. 14-15) He has not served in the military. (GE 1)  
 
Applicant’s evaluations indicate he has excellent integrity and supports the 
company’s ethical values. (Tr. 16; AE B; AE C) He has held a security clearance for 14 
years, and there is no evidence of alcohol abuse, drug abuse, security violations, or 
felony-level criminal convictions. (Tr. 16; GE 1; GE 2)   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant disclosed in his October 30, 2012 SCA and in his December 11, 2012 
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) that he had 
not filed his tax returns for tax years 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. (Tr. 21; GE 1; GE 2) 
In his OPM PSI, he said he planned to file his tax returns in December 2012 while he is 
on Christmas break. (GE 2) He said he was going to seek the assistance of an 
accountant. (GE 2) 
 
At his hearing, Applicant said after his OPM PSI, he did not file his tax returns 
because he believed his security clearance hearing would occur shortly after his 
interview, and he thought it “would look shady” or that he was “trying to cover up [his] 
tracks” if he took action on his taxes. (Tr. 35)  
 
3 
                                         
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges and Applicant admitted that he failed to timely file his 
federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2011. (HE 2; HE 3) In 
2009, Applicant was working on his 2008 tax return when his computer hard drive “died” 
or crashed. (Tr. 17; GE 2) His taxes for tax year 2008 were complicated because of 
some stock sales and the purchase of a house. (Tr. 17) After his computer problem, he 
became distracted by work and other commitments and did not get his taxes filed for tax 
year 2008 for several years. (Tr. 17) He frequently travels on behalf of his employer and 
taking care of his personal affairs may be difficult. (Tr. 26)   
 
 Applicant provided his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2008 through 
2011, and his Internal Revenue Service (IRS)-generated federal income tax return 
transcripts for tax years 2011 through 2015. (AE D-AE G) The following table

2014 Apr. 15, 2015 $3,579   AE G5 
2015 Apr. 15, 2016 $3,374   AE G6 
 
Applicant did not file his tax return for tax year 2009 because he needed information 
from his 2008 tax return to file the tax return for tax year 2009. (Tr. 18-19) He did not file 
his tax return for tax year 2010 because he also needed information from his 2009 tax 
return to file his tax return for 2010. (Tr. 18-19) Once he failed to file tax returns for one 
year, he believed he could not file tax returns for the subsequent years. (Tr. 31, 35) In 
April 2015, Applicant filed his tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2014. (Tr. 20, 33)  
 
                                            
1Applicant’s SOR does not allege that he did not timely file his 2012 and 2013 federal and state 
tax returns. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five 
circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 
14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). 
Consideration of these two allegations will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above.  
 
4 
                                         
 
 Applicant was reluctant to take the initiative or be aggressive to get his tax 
returns filed. (Tr. 23-24) After Applicant received the SOR in February 2016, he sought 
the assistant of a tax accountant. (Tr. 23) It was difficult to find professional help to file 
his taxes. (Tr. 37) In September 2016, with the assistance of an accountant, his 2008 
through 2010 tax returns were drafted, and he signed them on September 16, 2016, the 
day of his hearing. (Tr. 24, 33; AE D-AE F) He expects the tax returns for 2008, 2009, 
and 2010 will be accepted by the IRS soon. (Tr. 34)   
 
Applicant’s income has consistently increased over the years, and Applicant took 
zero dependents on a Form W-4, Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate, which 
maximized his tax deductions. (Tr. 18) He believed that if he did not owe any taxes that 
the government would not be concerned about his failure to file his tax returns. (Tr. 27, 
30; GE 1) No one ever told him that he did not have to file his tax returns if he did not 
owe taxes. (Tr. 40) He believed that he would not owe any taxes to the federal 
government when he filed his tax returns. (Tr. 25) If the government determines he 
owes additional taxes, Applicant promised to pay whatever he owes. (Tr. 26) He 
intended to utilize an accountant in the future to ensure his taxes are timely filed and 
paid. (Tr. 26, 38)  
 
Applicant does not have any unpaid, delinquent debts or negative entries on his 
credit report. (Tr. 28-30; AE H) Aside from his failure to timely file his federal and state 
tax returns, there are no other financial considerations concerns. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
 
5 
                                         
 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides one disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns as required . . . .” Applicant’s SOR alleges and Applicant admitted 
that he failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2008 
 
6 
                                         
 
through 2011. The record established the disqualifying condition in AG ¶ 19(g) requiring 
additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
  
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

7 
                                         
 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
No mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant presented some 
important positive financial information. His current credit report does not indicate any 
unpaid, delinquent debts. He does not owe any taxes to the federal or state 
government. I have credited Applicant with filing his tax returns for tax years 2008 to 
2011 shortly after his hearing. Applicant does not have any delinquent debts. When he 
did file his tax returns, he did not owe any taxes.   
 
A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal 
income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense.3 For purposes of this 
decision, I am not weighing Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal income tax 
returns against him. See also note 2, supra. 
 
The negative financial considerations concerns are more substantial. Applicant 
failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 
2011. The DOHA Appeal Board has commented: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. 
Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for 
protecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is 
not directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 
(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward 
inducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at 
evaluating an applicant’s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails 
repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the 
high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted 
                                            
3Title 26 U.S.C, § 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  
 
Any person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to 
make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to . . .  
make such return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times 
required by law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be 
guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .  
 
A willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, is a misdemeanor 
without regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States 
v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O’Brien v. 
United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. 1931).

access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 
(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union 
Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 
886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 
2002)). ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board 
clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the 
applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent 
such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant’s 
security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing 
irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR 
Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, 
no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employed an “all’s well that 
ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified 
information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
In ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant 
disqualifying facts:  
 
Applicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and 
received a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in 
September 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He 
received Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. 
 
Notwithstanding the lack of any tax debt, the Appeal Board provided the following 
principal rationale for reversal: 
 
Failure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an 
applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government 
rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is 
essential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his 
2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, 
Applicant did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and 
reliability required of persons granted access to classified information.  
 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted).  
 
The negative financial and judgment information is more significant. Applicant 
signed his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2010 on 
September 16, 2016, and he instructed his accountant to send the tax returns to the 
IRS. Like the Applicant in ISCR Case No. 15-01031, he did not owe any taxes, and he 
was entitled to a refund for each of the tax years. Applicant’s filings were significantly 
less timely than the applicant in ISCR 15-01031. His explanations for not filing his tax 
returns justify at most a brief delay for filing his income tax returns. My assessment is 
 
9 
                                         
 
that his failure to timely file his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2008 through 
2011 is based mostly on procrastination, his belief that he would not suffer any penalty 
so long as he was due a refund, and his failure to give filing his tax returns a high 
priority. His explanations do not fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is 39 years old, and he has worked for the same employer since 2001. 
He is a senior software engineer. In 2002, he received a bachelor’s degree with a major 
in computer science. Applicant’s evaluations indicate he has excellent integrity and 
supports the company’s ethical values. He has held a security clearance for 14 years, 
and there is no evidence of alcohol abuse, use of illegal drugs, security violations, or 
felony-level criminal arrests or convictions.    
 
Applicant signed his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2008 
through 2010 on September 16, 2016, and I have credited Applicant with filing those 
four tax returns in September 2016. His failure to timely file his 2008 through 2011 
federal and state tax returns when due raises unresolved financial considerations 
security concerns. When a tax issue is involved, an administrative judge is required to 
consider how long an applicant waits to file their tax returns, whether the IRS generates 
the tax returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and 
complete making payments.4 The primary problem here is that Applicant waited seven 
                                            
4While Applicant did not have any delinquent taxes, the recent emphasis of the Appeal Board on 
security concerns arising from tax cases is instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 
7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax 
deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a 
determination that Applicant has rehabilitated himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of

years to file his 2008 federal and state tax returns, and other tax returns were not filed 
timely for substantial periods of time. The positive information he submitted about his 
employment and non-tax financial responsibility does not fully mitigate his failure to 
timely file his tax returns when due.   
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to 
Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a 
determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for 
award of a security clearance in the future. With a track record of behavior consistent 
with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his 
security clearance worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. 
 
  
                                                                                                                                            
rules and regulations expected of someone entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-
01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed 
corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant’s control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax 
liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant’s wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to 
timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a 
security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to 
resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board 
reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax 
returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his 
hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established 
payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-
tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the 
allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure to 
file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established government 
rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) 
(reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A 
security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national 
secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an 
applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.”).

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
