Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke her eligibility for
access to classified information. She did not present sufficient documentary evidence to
mitigate the concern stemming from a history of financial problems or difficulties,
including a failure to file federal and state individual income tax returns on a timely basis
for recent tax years. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on March 20, 2012.  More than three years later on August1
27, 2015,  after reviewing the application and information gathered during a background
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD)  sent Applicant a statement of reasons2
(SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to3
a complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action under the security guideline known as
Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant answered the SOR with a two-page
memorandum on October 23, 2015.      
Neither Applicant nor Department Counsel requested a hearing, and so the case
will be decided on the written record.  On January 14, 2016, Department Counsel4
submitted all relevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing.  The5
file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant, who received it on January 27,
2016. She did not reply within the 30-day period from receipt of the FORM. The case
was assigned to me on August 8, 2016. 
Procedural Matters    
Applicant submitted a number of documents along with her answer to the SOR.
For clarity of the written record, those documents are marked and admitted as
evidentiary exhibits as follows: (1) Exhibit A–IRS income tax records (13 pages); (2)
Exhibit B–documentation concerning a work-related injury (3 pages); (3) Exhibit C–wage
garnishment paperwork for student loans (7 pages); and (4) Exhibit D–wage
garnishment paperwork for a debt owed to a federal agency (10 pages).  
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 51-year-old employee who requires a security clearance for her
job with a company working in the defense industry. She has worked as a federal
contractor for various companies since at least 1999.  She married in 1993 and6
divorced in 2009. She has three children, born in 1982, 1985, and 1999. She has lived

at the same residence since 2006. Her educational background includes a bachelor’s
degree awarded in 2010. 
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges 11 financial matters that can be grouped as
follows: (1) SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.h–three delinquent consumer accounts for a total of
about $16,921; (2) SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f–four delinquent federal student loan
accounts for a total of about $32,505; (3) SOR ¶ 1.g–a medical collection account for
$532; (4) SOR ¶ 1.i–a $3,298 delinquent debt owed to a federal agency; and (5) SOR
¶¶ 1.m and 1.n–failure to file federal and state individual income tax returns on a timely
basis for tax years 2009–2013. 
In her answer to the SOR, Applicant indirectly admitted the SOR allegations and
provided explanations for her situation. She explained that (1) her separation and
divorce affected her financial situation and decisions; (2) obtaining a mortgage loan and
adjusting to being a single parent and helping her adult children affected her financial
situation; (3) she assured that she would not engage in unlawful, untrustworthy, or
unreliable conduct; and (4) she was attempting to obtain a modification of her mortgage
loan to assist her in resolving the delinquent financial accounts. 
The three delinquent consumer accounts for a total of about $16,921 are
unresolved. Applicant did not submit documentation showing that the accounts were
paid, settled, in a payment plan, cancelled, forgiven, or otherwise resolved.
The four delinquent federal student loan accounts for a total of about $32,505 are
unresolved. Applicant submitted paperwork showing that a garnishment order was
implemented in about September 2015 for a total amount due of $41,146.  She did not,7
however, submit documentation showing a record of payment since September 2015.
The medical collection account for $532 is unresolved. Applicant submitted
paperwork showing that it stems from a denial of a workers’ compensation claim for a
work-related injury.8
The $3,298 delinquent debt owed to a federal agency is unresolved. Applicant
submitted paperwork showing that a garnishment order was implemented in about
October 2015 for a total amount due of $5,365.  She did not, however, submit9
documentation showing a record of payment since October 2015. 
The failure to file federal and state individual income tax returns on a timely basis
for tax years 2009–2013 is largely unresolved. In Applicant’s 2012 security clearance
application, she explained that she failed to file federal and state income tax returns due

to procrastination.  She submitted documentation, IRS tax records, showing that she10
has made some progress.  The IRS tax records show the following: (1) she filed her11
2008 federal return on time, and the account balance is $0; (2) she filed her 2010
federal return late on May 14, 2012, and the account balance is $1,910; (3) she filed her
2011 federal return late on May 7, 2012, and received a refund of $1,985; and (4) as of
March 26, 2014, she had not filed her 2012 federal return. In addition, the same IRS tax
records show that Applicant had adjusted gross income of $72,562 in 2008, $85,430 in
2010, and $85,745 in 2011. She did not submit documentation concerning her state
income tax returns for 2009–2013.  
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As12
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt13
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An14
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  15
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting16
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An17
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate

facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate18
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme19
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.20
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.21
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it22
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant23
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 24
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
 AG ¶ 18.  25
 AG ¶ 20(a)–(f).26
6
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  25
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
In analyzing this case, I considered the following disqualifying and mitigating
conditions under Guideline F:  26
AG ¶ 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG ¶ 19(g) failure to file annual federal, state, or local income tax returns
as required or the fraudulent filing of the same;
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
AG ¶ 20(c) [t]here are clear indications that the problem is being resolved
or is under control; and 
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
The evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic
financial history sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. With that said, I
am not concerned about the $532 medical collection account stemming from a work-
related injury. The debt was incurred for necessary medical care or treatment, and it is
not indicative of frivolous or irresponsible spending. SOR ¶ 1.g is decided for Applicant. 
Nevertheless, I have concerns about Applicant’s problematic financial situation,
as it is largely unresolved and ongoing. She has apparently done little if anything to
address the delinquent consumer debts. The student loans and the other federal debt
are subject to garnishment orders, which belies a good-faith effort to repay. I am
particularly concerned about her federal and state tax problems. Although she filed the
delinquent federal returns for 2010 and 2011, the delinquent federal returns for 2009,
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).27
7
2012, and 2013 are outstanding. The same is true for the state returns for 2009–2013. It
is also unknown how much, if any, Applicant owes in federal and state back taxes for
the tax years in question. Her tax problems require close examination. Indeed, failure to
file tax returns on a timely basis suggests that an applicant has a problem with
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary compliance
with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information.
I have considered the various circumstances that played a part in Applicant’s
financial problems, such as her separation and divorce, which occurred several years
ago. I considered her efforts to fix her tax problems. I also considered her motivation,
and I have no concerns that she is a tax protestor, is tax defiant, or is otherwise
opposed to meeting her tax obligations. I assess the overall situation as one in which
Applicant exercised exceptionally poor judgment for a number of years due to willful
neglect or procrastination or both. The result was a situation that snowballed over the
years to become a major problem, which is still unresolved. To sum up, Applicant’s tax
problems are too much, went on too long, and are too recent to justify a favorable
decision.  
Applicant’s ongoing financial problems create doubt about her current reliability,
trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching
this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable
evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due
consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I conclude that she did not27
meet her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.f: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.g: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.h–1.n: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
