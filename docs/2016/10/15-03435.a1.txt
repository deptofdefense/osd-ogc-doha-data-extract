APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On
December 2, 2015, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. 
On August 2, 2016, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)
Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant
appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge’s findings of fact
contained errors; whether the Judge failed to consider all of the evidence in the record; and whether
the Judge’s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the
following, we affirm.  
The Judge’s Findings of Fact
Applicant has held a security clearance for over 20 years without incident or concern.  He
served in the military from 1972 to 1978, rising to the grade of E-5.  Applicant has experienced
some circumstances that had a harmful impact on his finances.  For example, after his employer
moved to a different state, Applicant was unemployed for a month before taking a job with a
different company at a reduced salary.  Several years later, his spouse had surgery, with the result
that she could not work, thereby reducing the household income by about $35,000 a year.  As a
consequence of these difficulties, some of Applicant’s debts became delinquent.  Applicant has an
annual salary of $68,000.  He recently began receiving social security benefits of $2,230 a month,
as well as a pension from a previous job in the amount of $2,100 a month.  He received financial
counseling in 2009 or 2010.  
Applicant’s debts include approximately $3,400 owed to a bank.  This account became
delinquent in 2011 and was charged off in February 2016.  Applicant had several accounts with this
creditor and paid off one of them.  Other debts include $2,040 owed to another bank and a $10,000
tax lien filed by the IRS for delinquent taxes.  Applicant’s tax delinquency resulted from his having
miscalculated the amounts he owed the Government, as well as his having had inadequate
withholding.  The SOR alleged delinquencies owed for tax year 2009.  Applicant also owes back
taxes for 2011, 2013, and 2015.  The Judge stated that he was considering the non-alleged tax
delinquencies for the permitted purposes as set forth in ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct.
26, 2006).1  Applicant has a payment plan that includes tax delinquencies for 2009, 2011, and 2013. 
He submitted checks showing payments of $175 a month from November 2015 to June 2016.  He
has reduced his tax debt to $8,000.
The Judge’s Analysis
The Judge cited to evidence of circumstances outside Applicant’s control that affected his
finances.  However, given his salary and retirement benefits, Applicant did not explain why he had
not made more progress in resolving his tax delinquencies.  Although he resolved several debts in
Applicant’s favor, he found that three of them were not resolved as of the close of the record,
including the significant tax debt. 
Discussion
Applicant contends that the Judge’s findings are insufficient because they do not include
information about three of the debts alleged in the SOR.  However, two of the debts that Applicant
mentions in his brief were resolved in his favor.  Therefore, any error regarding them is harmless. 
1To assess credibility; to evaluate the applicant’s mitigation evidence; to consider the extent to which the
applicant has demonstrated rehabilitation; to decide whether a given provision of the Guidelines is applicable; and/or
to perform a whole-person analysis.
The other debt is one owed to a bank.  Applicant contends that he had paid this debt off.  However,
the Judge found that Applicant had more than one debt at this bank.  He found that one of them had
been resolved but that the one alleged in the SOR had simply been charged off.  This finding is
consistent with the record that was before him.  Applicant also states that the Judge erred in finding
that he owed $25,000 in delinquent debt.  He states that the outstanding amount is much less. 
However, the challenged finding is the total amount alleged in the SOR.  The Judge found that the
total amount of unresolved debt was about $12,000.  Decision at 8.  The Judge’s  material findings
of security concern are supported by substantial evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3
(App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014).  Moreover, Applicant has failed to rebut the presumption that the Judge
considered all of the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05795 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr.
26, 2016).   
The Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the
decision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that a clearance may
be granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’”  Department
of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b):  “Any doubt
concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor
of the national security.”
