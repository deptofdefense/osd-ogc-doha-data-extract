MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Afforded a financial fresh start through bankruptcy in 1999, Applicant defaulted on 
eight student loans totaling $36,000 in 2011. He and his spouse owed delinquent federal 
and state income taxes for tax years 2010 through 2014 because of insufficient tax 
withholdings. Applicant has paid $25,528 toward his student loans through wage 
garnishment since January 2013. He has been making installment payments to the IRS to 
reduce his federal tax debt to $1,200 and has a repayment plan established to address 
$3,717 in past-due state income taxes. Clearance is granted. 
 
 Statement of the Case  
 
On November 14, 2015, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the 
security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and explaining why it was 
unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him security 
clearance eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
 
 
 2 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective 
within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations on December 15, 2015, and he 
requested a decision on the written record without a hearing. On January 20, 2016, the 
Government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of seven documents 
(Items 1-7), including Applicant’s answer to the SOR (Item 1). On January 21, 2016, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) forwarded a copy of the FORM to 
Applicant and instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the 
FORM on February 4, 2016. On February 24, 2016, Applicant submitted his rebuttal to the 
SOR, which was received by DOHA on February 29, 2016. On March 1, 2016, Department 
Counsel indicated that the Government did not object to the consideration of Applicant’s 
response to the FORM. On March 22, 2016, the case was assigned to me to consider 
whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for 
Applicant. Applicant’s rebuttal to the FORM is hereby incorporated in the record as 
Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. 
 
Summary of SOR Allegations and Response 
 
 The SOR alleges that Applicant owed a $507 past-due consumer credit debt (SOR ¶ 
1.a) and collection debts of $175 (SOR ¶ 1.b) and $74 (SOR ¶ 1.k), eight defaulted student 
loans totaling $35,404 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.j), delinquent federal income tax debt totaling $5,701 
for tax years 2010 – 2012 (SOR ¶¶ 1.l, 1.m(1), and 1.m(2)),
1
 and delinquent state income 
tax debt totaling $3,327 (SOR ¶¶ 1.n-1.p). Additionally, the SOR alleges that Applicant was 
granted a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in August 1999 (SOR ¶ 1.q). 
 
When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted having owed the credit debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.a, the student loans, and the federal and state income tax liabilities. He also 
admitted the 1999 bankruptcy. He denied the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.k because he did 
not recognize them. In a detailed response, Applicant explained that he thought the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.a had been paid off over two years ago and that he has been repaying his 
defaulted student loans at $273.40 every two weeks by payroll deduction in effect since 
January 24, 2013. He explained that he had defaulted on his student loans because of high 
rent at the time. Concerning his delinquent federal taxes, Applicant indicated that he paid 
his federal tax debt for 2010 and 2011; that he was currently repaying the $4,232 debt for 
tax year 2012 at $150 per month; and that his anticipated refund for 2015 would be applied 
to his balance. As for his past-due state taxes, Applicant had arranged for $110.53 monthly 
payments. He explained that after they filed their 2010 income tax returns and owed taxes, 
he asked his spouse to file her W-4 as married but withhold at a single rate with zero 
dependents. He did not discover that she had failed to do what he had requested until they 
filed their returns for tax year 2012, owing $4,232 because his spouse received severance 
pay following a layoff.  Applicant indicated that he had adjusted his tax withholdings, both 
state and federal, on April 2, 2015, claiming single status with no dependents. Applicant did

The SOR as issued includes two subparagraphs designated as 1.m, the first alleging unpaid federal income 
taxes of $760 for tax year 2011 and the second alleging unpaid federal income taxes of $709 for tax year 
2010. I am sua sponte amending the SOR to designate the subparagraphs as 1.m(1) and 1.m(2), respectively.

not comment about the bankruptcy other than to state that it should have been cleared 
from his record due to the passage of ten years’ time. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
After considering the FORM and Applicant’s rebuttal (AE A), I make the following 
findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 55-year-old senior technical support specialist with two Associate 
degrees awarded in May 1987 and May 1988. He served in the United States military from 
September 1979 until September 1983, when he was granted an honorable discharge. He 
held a DOD secret clearance for his military duties. Applicant and his spouse have been 
married since January 1985, and they have four grown children ages 30, 28, 25, and 19. 
(Item 2.) 
 
Applicant started working for his current defense contractor employer in September 
1995. He returned to college full time from August 2004 to May 2009 while working part 
time, although he has not yet earned a Bachelor’s degree. He paid for his studies partially 
through $36,000 in student loans obtained between August 2004 and August 2007 (SOR 
¶¶ 1.c-1.j). In June 2011, Applicant and his family moved to a house at a high rent that 
strained the household finances, so Applicant stopped paying on his student loans. (Items 
1-7.) As of August 2012, his student loans were in collection status with a $45,924 
aggregate balance. (Item 7.) In January 2013, the servicer for his student loans began to 
garnish Applicant’s pay. (Item 1.) 
 
Applicant and his spouse also had income tax problems. Acting on a co-worker’s 
advice, Applicant’s spouse did not have enough taxes withheld from her income in 2010. 
Applicant learned of his spouse’s insufficient tax withholdings in 2011 when he and his 
spouse filed their tax returns for 2010 and they owed federal and state taxes. (Items 1, 3.) 
A December 2015 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) transcript for tax year 2010 shows that 
on joint adjusted gross income of $88,496, Applicant and his spouse owed federal income 
taxes of $1,331. They submitted a tax payment of $800 with their return. (AE A.) 
Applicant’s spouse did not act on Applicant’s advice to change her withholding status to 
single with no dependents, and so they owed taxes when they filed their returns for tax 
years 2011 and 2012. An IRS transcript for tax year 2011 shows that they owed $1,586 on 
adjusted gross income of $92,091, and that they submitted $942 with their return. 
Applicant’s spouse was laid off in 2012 and received severance pay from which no taxes 
were withheld, so their tax liability was approximately $4,232 for 2012. (Item 1.) On August 
9, 2013, Applicant entered into an installment agreement with the IRS to repay their 
delinquent federal taxes. (AE A.) 
 
On August 14, 2013, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a 
Questionnaire for National Security Positions incorporated within an Electronic 
Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). In response to a financial record 
inquiry concerning whether he had failed to file or pay federal, state, or other taxes required 
by law or ordinance, Applicant indicated that he and his spouse owed the IRS 
 
 4 
approximately $531 for tax year 2010, $644 for tax year 2011, and $4,075 for tax year 
2012, but they had arranged a repayment plan with the IRS. First payments were due for 
2010 in October 2013, for 2011 in February 2014, and for 2012 in May 2014. Applicant 
also disclosed that he and his spouse owed state income taxes of $579 for 2010, $1,259 
for 2011, and $1,492 for 2012. He indicated that he was working on establishing a payment 
plan with the state for their delinquent state taxes. Applicant responded affirmatively to 
inquiries concerning delinquencies involving routine accounts, and he listed the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.a, his defaulted student loans estimated at $45,577, and a $500 credit card debt 
from November 2012 that was paid in collection (not alleged in SOR). Applicant added that 
he had contacted the lender in SOR ¶ 1.a to set up a repayment plan and that his student 
loans were being paid through wage garnishment at $334.56 every two weeks. (Item 1.) 
 
As of August 22, 2013, Applicant owed outstanding collection balances of $507 
(SOR ¶ 1.a) and of $74 from February 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.k). (Item 7.) A $150 medical debt 
from August 2012 was referred for collection in February 2014. (Item 4.) Other accounts 
had been paid after being charged off or placed for collection. A joint automobile loan of 
$11,375 from August 2012 was being paid on time. (Item 7.) 
 
On September 13, 2013, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He indicated that he had a tentative payment 
plan with the IRS to repay his and his spouse’s federal tax delinquencies at $300 per 
month starting in October 2013 and that he was attempting to work out a similar 
arrangement for their state tax liabilities. About the credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.a, Applicant 
explained that his account was cancelled in July 2012 and that he was trying to arrange a 
payment plan for the collection debt. As for his student loans, Applicant indicated that they 
were placed for collection in 2012 and that $367 was being taken from his pay every two 
weeks for the loans. Applicant explained that his financial problems were caused by vehicle 
problems in July 2012. Within a four-day period, both his and his son’s cars had 
mechanical problems. He used credit to cover the $2,000 in repair costs only to have both 
cars break down within a week. Applicant traded in both cars and took out an auto loan to 
purchase another vehicle. Applicant also speculated that his spouse was using her income 
to support her sister without telling him. Applicant maintained that he was capable of 
meeting his current obligations, although he had little money left over after paying monthly 
expenses.
2
 (Item 3.) 
 
Applicant’s and his spouse’s federal tax debt for tax year 2010 was paid off in 
December 2013. Their federal tax debt for tax year 2011 was satisfied in March 2014. (AE 
A.) On April 2, 2015, Applicant adjusted his income tax withholdings, both federal and 
state, to single status with zero allowances. (Item 1.) As of February 10, 2016, they owed 
the IRS $6,390 in past-due taxes, penalties, and interest for tax years 2012, 2013, and 
2014. In late February 2016, the IRS applied their $4,227 tax refund for tax year 2015 to 
their tax debt to reduce the outstanding balance to $1,200. (AE A.) On December 8, 2015, 
                                                 
2 
Applicant was placed on notice in the FORM that he could object to the inclusion of the report of subject 
interview due to the lack of authentication pursuant to ¶ E3.1.20 of the Directive. He submitted a rebuttal to the 
FORM that was silent on the issue. He is considered to have waived his objection to the admissibility of the 
summary. 
 
 5 
Applicant and his spouse entered into an installment agreement to pay $3,717 in past-due 
state income taxes for 2010 through 2012 at $110 per month. (Item 1; AE A.) Applicant 
expects that their anticipated refund of $798 for 2015 will be intercepted by the state and 
applied to their outstanding tax liability. (AE A.) 
 
 Applicant’s defaulted student loans continue to be repaid through wage 
garnishment, currently at $273 every two weeks (AE A), as evidenced by the decreasing 
debt balances from $40,722 in March 2015 (Item 5) to $32,209 in September 2015 (Item 
4.) Through 2015, Applicant had paid a total of $25,528 ($15,500 in principal) toward his 
defaulted student loans to reduce the balance to $30,078. (AE A.) 
 
 Around March 2015, Applicant and his spouse moved from a single family home to 
an apartment to reduce rental expenses. (Items 1, 4.) As of October 28, 2015, Applicant 
had made no payments on the credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.a. He had only one open 
revolving charge account, a credit card opened in January 2015 with a $500 credit limit. He 
had a history of timely payments on the account, which had a balance of $489. Applicant 
was current in his payments on a vehicle loan opened in late August 2012 for $11,375. As 
of late September 2015, his auto loan had a balance of $5,420. He had no other open 
loans on his credit record. (Item 4.)   
 
 In December 2015, the collection agent for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a offered to settle 
the $507 balance for $253 in a lump sum paid no later than January 29, 2016, or for $304 
payable in two monthly installments. On February 24, 2016, Applicant indicated that he had 
elected the second option and would be settling the debt in full with the second payment 
due February 29, 2016. As of February 24, 2016, Applicant was disputing the debts in SOR 
¶¶ 1.b and 1.k. (AE A.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
 
 6 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern about financial considerations is articulated in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 The Guideline F concerns are amply established by Applicant’s 1999 bankruptcy 
discharge (SOR ¶ 1.q) and by his more recent defaults of a $507 credit card debt (SOR ¶ 
1.a), his student loans obtained between August 2004 and August 2007 for $36,000 (SOR 
¶¶ 1.c-1.j), and his and his spouse’s past-due federal and state taxes totaling 
approximately $9,000 for tax years 2010 through 2012 (SOR ¶¶ 1.l-1.p). Disqualifying 
conditions AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a 
history of not meeting financial obligations,” are established. 
 
 Applicant disputes the collection debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($175) and 1.k ($74), which he 
does not recognize. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.k is listed on his August 2013 credit report (Item 
 
 7 
7) as a $74 debt from February 2013 identified as “LOAN TYPE: COLLECTION 
ATTORNEY.” The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b appears on his October 2015 credit report (Item 4) as 
a $175 balance on an unidentified medical collection account placed in February 2014 for 
$150. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that a credit report can be sufficient to meet the 
substantial evidence standard for the government’s burden of producing evidence of 
alleged delinquent debts. See ISCR 14-03612 (App. Bd. Aug. 2015). However, these two 
debts are not of sufficient magnitude to raise a significant security concern. 
 
Concerning mitigation of the undisputed allegations, Applicant has not commented 
about his bankruptcy other than to indicate that it should no longer be on his credit record 
due to the passage of time. The file contains no information about the nature or extent of 
his financial liabilities discharged in 1999. Without evidence showing a history of credit 
mismanagement before the bankruptcy, the bankruptcy is of little present security concern. 
In contrast, mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current, reliability, or good judgment,” cannot reasonably apply to 
his student loans, his tax delinquencies, or the credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.a. He defaulted 
on his student loans in 2011, but repayment has been by involuntary garnishment and only 
since 2013. Concerning his federal income taxes, the evidence shows a history of 
delinquency not only for 2010 through 2012, but for 2013 and 2014 as well. There is no 
evidence of state tax delinquency for 2013 and 2014. However, Applicant and his spouse 
did not have a plan in place until late December 2015 to address their $3,717 in state 
income tax delinquency for tax years 2010 through 2012. 
 
 When Applicant was interviewed for his security clearance in September 2013, he 
attributed his student loan and credit card defaults to vehicle problems that started in July 
2012. In the same week, both his and his son’s vehicles had mechanical problems. He 
relied on credit cards to pay the $2,000 in repair costs. Within a week, they broke down 
again. He had to obtain a loan for a newer car. The unexpected car expenses are a 
mitigating circumstance contemplated within mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(b), which 
provides: 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
 
Other evidence suggests another cause, however. Applicant acknowledged in his response 
to the SOR that he defaulted on his student loans and on the credit card in 2011, after he 
and his family moved to a house at an undisclosed high rent. 
 
As for his income tax problems, Applicant asserts that he was unaware that his 
spouse had insufficient taxes withheld from her income for tax year 2010. He maintains 
that when he realized that her lack of tax withholding caused their tax underpayment for 
2010, he advised his spouse to claim single status with no dependents. She apparently 
failed to adjust her withholdings for 2011. Their tax problems were then exacerbated when 
 
 8 
taxes were not withheld from a severance package his spouse received when she was laid 
off in 2012. AG ¶ 20(b) has some applicability, but the evidence also shows that Applicant 
and his spouse underpaid their federal income taxes for tax years 2013 and 2014 as well. 
It is difficult to find that Applicant acted fully responsibly when he waited until April 2, 2015, 
to adjust his own income tax withholdings to ensure that sufficient taxes are withheld from 
his income. In addition, he did not have a plan in place to address his past-due state 
income taxes until late December 2015. He has yet to explain why he was unable to repay 
the credit card collection debt of only $507 when he and his spouse were underpaying their 
income taxes. 
 
Applicant is credited with establishing an installment agreement with the IRS on 
August 9, 2013, to address his and his spouse’s delinquent federal income taxes. Applicant 
paid off their federal tax delinquency for 2010 in December 2013 and for 2011 in March 
2014. IRS records show that as of February 10, 2016, he still owed $869 for tax year 2012. 
He did not provide a transcript for tax year 2012 showing dates or amounts of payments to 
that date, although the reduced balance supports his claim of monthly payments to the 
IRS. Applicant’s and his spouse’s federal tax delinquency for 2012 was fully satisfied in late 
February 2016 when the IRS applied their refund for 2015. AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has 
received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that 
the problem is being resolved or is under control,” and AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a 
good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,” have some 
applicability to his federal income tax debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.l-1.m. Even so, some concern 
arises by his delay in adjusting his income tax withholdings to ensure that adequate income 
was taken for his taxes. 
 
Concerning Applicant’s student loans, which represent the bulk of his past-due debt, 
the loan servicer began garnishing his pay in January 2013. Applicant told an OPM 
interviewer in September 2013 that he had a modified payment plan for the creditor to take 
$367 from his pay every two weeks. When he responded to the SOR, Applicant indicated 
that he has deductions from his pay for his student loan debt. The intimation is of voluntary 
payments, but other evidence indicates that garnishment commenced in response to 
creditor action. Applicant indicates that he was notified by payroll of the deduction. 
Payments made through wage garnishment, especially when the creditor initiates action, 
do not reflect the good faith required under AG ¶ 20(d). However, AG ¶ 20(c) must be 
considered because the student loans are being resolved. Applicant’s pay has been 
garnished for a total of $25,527 since January 2013.

Applicant presented no evidence of payments toward either his and his spouse’s 
delinquent state income tax delinquency or his credit card collection debt, but he does have 
repayment plans in place that could implicate AG ¶ 20(c), provided he can be counted on 
to make the promised payments. As of late February 2016, Applicant owed delinquent 
federal income taxes of $1,200 and about $3,500 in state taxes if he made his first two 
payments under his agreement with the state. As of the end of 2015, the delinquent 
student loans in the SOR had an aggregate balance of $30,078, which is a substantial debt

Some $15,500 of the $25,528 went toward the principal balance. The rest went to interest and collection 
fees. (AE A.)

burden. Applicant’s default of his student loans is not condoned, but he is also not incurring 
new debt that could compromise his finances going forward. As of October 2015, he had 
only two open accounts on his credit record (credit card opened in January 2015 and car 
loan opened in August 2012), and he has never been late in his payments on those 
accounts. The file before me for review does not include a budget showing Applicant’s 
current household income or expenses, but he also does not appear to be promising 
payments that he cannot make or taking on new debt beyond what he can afford. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and 
all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative 
process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at 
the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) 
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person assessment, but 
some aspects warrant additional comment. Applicant exercised poor financial judgment in 
defaulting on his student loans in 2011 and, more recently, in failing to make a timely 
adjustment to his own tax withholdings. Applicant attributed his and his spouse’s tax 
underpayments to his spouse, who he asserts did not have enough of her income withheld 
for taxes. However, he was just as culpable, as he did not adjust his withholding status until 
April 2, 2015, some four years after he first became aware of the problem. Consequently, 
Applicant and his spouse underpaid their federal income taxes for some five years (tax 
years 2010 through 2014) and their state income taxes for at least three years (tax years 
2010 through 2012). 
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security 
clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th
 
Cir. 1990). At the same time, 
a determination of an applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance should not be made as 
punishment for specific past conduct, but on a reasonable and careful evaluation of the 
evidence to determine if a nexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security 
concern. Applicant is not seen as likely to jeopardize his longtime employment and the 
income that he needs to continue to pay his student loans and back taxes and cover his 
household obligations. He has made changes to ensure against a recurrence of the tax 
problems by adjusting his income tax withholdings and by moving to more affordable 
housing. Applicant is not required to establish that he has paid off each debt in the SOR, or 
 
 10 
even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR.

 He has made sufficient progress 
toward reducing his student loan and tax debts to conclude that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.q: For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

4 The DOHA Appeal Board stated in ISCR Case No. 07-06482, decided on May 21, 2008, in part: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the concept of 
“‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through 
payment of debts.” See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). 
However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. 
Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has “. . . 
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). The 
Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his 
actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his 
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr.4, 2008). Likewise, there is no requirement that 
the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the 
SOR.
