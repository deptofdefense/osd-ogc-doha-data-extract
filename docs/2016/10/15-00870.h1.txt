MENDEZ, Francisco, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not mitigate security concerns raised by his financial 
circumstances. He incurred a sizeable tax debt about five years ago and, despite 
earning a considerable amount in compensation through his employment as a federal 
contractor over the past few years, he has yet to establish a payment plan or otherwise 
resolve the tax debt, which currently stands at over $230,000. Notwithstanding the 
presence of some extenuating circumstances and other favorable information, Applicant 
failed to meet his heavy burden of persuasion for continued access to classified 
information. Clearance is denied. 
 
History of the Case 
 
On August 7, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging 
security concerns under the financial considerations guideline.1 Applicant answered the 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

SOR and requested a hearing to establish his eligibility for continued access to 
classified information. 
 
 On November 23, 2015, Department Counsel was ready to proceed and 
requested an administrative judge be assigned to hear the case. On March 3, 2016, I 
was assigned the case and, after coordinating with the parties, scheduled the hearing 
for April 28, 2016.2  
 
 The hearing was convened as scheduled, and the exhibits offered by both sides 
were admitted in evidence without objection.3 Applicant chose to testify and called his 
girlfriend as a witness. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on May 6, 2016.  
 
 After the hearing, Applicant submitted three additional exhibits that were admitted 
in evidence without objection.4 The last post-hearing exhibit was submitted on July 8, 
2016. No additional evidence was submitted by either side thereafter and, thus, the 
record closed on July 8, 2016.5 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant, who is in late thirties, is a key officer of a company that has been 
awarded a number of federal contracts. He has an ownership stake in the company and 
runs its day-to-day operations. Applicant and his company have received numerous 
awards and recognition for their work. Applicant earned over $210,000 in total 
compensation in 2015, consisting of a base salary of approximately $175,000 and a 
bonus of about $35,000. He recently received corporate distributions totaling over 
$65,000. He anticipates his total compensation package will increase to between 
$300,000 and $500,000 in 2017. Applicant lives with his girlfriend and they share living 
expenses. He estimates that his recurring monthly expenses are between $1,700 and 
$2,000 a month.6 Applicant testified that after paying expenses, legal fees, and setting 
aside money to pay his taxes, he has “almost nothing” left over each month.7  
                                                          
2 Prehearing scheduling correspondence, the notice of hearing, and case management order are 
attached as Hearing Exhibits (Hx.) I – III, respectively.  
 
3 Government exhibits (Gx.) 1 – 6 and Applicant’s exhibits (Ax.) A – W. The exhibits attached to 
Applicant’s Answer were identified as Enclosure (Encl.) 1 – 3 and Attachment (Atch.) A – I, and were also 
admitted in evidence without objection. (Tr. at 11-13)

5 Applicant anticipated his rental property would be sold by August 2016. He expected to receive a 
windfall of approximately $150,000 from the sale of the property, which he would then use to reduce his 
sizeable tax debt. Applicant’s post-hearing exhibits relate to the deletion of inaccurate information 
appearing on his credit reports. Applicant did not provide any post-hearing documents regarding the sale 
of the property, nor evidence that he entered into an installment agreement with the IRS or made 
payments to satisfy the outstanding tax debt for tax years 2003-2007 totaling over $230,000,

 From 1997 to 2002, Applicant served in the U.S. military. He then served as a 
U.S. Government (USG) contractor in Iraq from 2003 to 2007. Applicant was advised 
that his earnings were excluded from U.S. income taxes, because he was directly 
supporting the U.S. mission in a designated combat zone. Applicant testified that he 
earned from $400 to $1,000 a day as a USG contractor in Iraq. In 2010, Applicant found 
out that his earnings were subject to U.S. income taxes. In the spring of 2011, the IRS 
informed Applicant that he owed approximately $150,000 in back taxes for 2003 – 2007. 
The tax debt has increased to over $230,000, and the IRS has filed tax liens against 
Applicant’s rental property in State A. Two of the federal tax liens are referenced at 
SOR 1.f and 1.g, and remain unresolved.8  
 
When Applicant returned to the United States, several matters beyond the tax 
issue negatively impacted his finances.  
 
1)  Applicant’s first wife left him shortly after he returned to the United States in 
2008. She absconded with most of their savings, including about $100,000 that 
Applicant had managed to save. Applicant and his first wife were married in 
2008, and divorced in 2009.  
 
2)  Applicant experienced a decrease in income after leaving his overseas USG 
contract position. He then lost his job in about August 2009, and “went five 
months without a paycheck.”9 His gross income for 2009 was approximately 
$135,000. After losing his job, Applicant and his two partners purchased the 
company that he now runs. Applicant’s starting annual salary was approximately 
$100,000. He routinely used his income to pay company expenses. By 2012 or 
2013, the company was turning a profit and Applicant’s salary was increased to 
$160,000. He now earns an annual salary of over $175,000.  
 
3)  In 2009, in the midst of his financial trouble, Applicant looked to sell a home 
he owns in State A. He was unable to sell the property, which he had purchased 
in 2006; because it had lost a significant amount of its value due to the collapse 
of the U.S. housing market. He rented out the property and lived off the rent for 
some time, but received no rental income for about 18 months. He fell behind on 
his mortgage payments and other financial obligations. As of the hearing, 
Applicant was renting the property to a reliable, long-term tenant who had 
expressed interest in purchasing the property. He brought the primary mortgage 
on the property current, contacted the lender holding the charged-off second 
mortgage to negotiate a settlement, and addressed the non-tax-related debts 
appearing on the SOR. He recently hired a debt verification firm to help him 
dispute certain debts and remove inaccurate information appearing on his credit 
reports. Applicant resolved or is resolving the non-tax-related SOR debts.

4)  In 2010, shortly after starting his present company, Applicant married his 
second wife. He subsequently discovered she had been unfaithful and they 
divorced in 2012. Applicant was left financially responsible for some of the marital 
debt from his second marriage.10  
 
In 2010, Applicant retained a tax attorney. Applicant initially hired the attorney to 
help him address a state tax debt. State B started garnishing Applicant’s pay for the 
taxes he had not paid while working overseas as a USG contractor. He resolved the 
state tax debt through a loan from his company.11   
  
In 2011, the IRS notified Applicant that he owed about $150,000 in federal 
income taxes for tax years 2003 – 2007. Applicant discussed with his tax attorney the 
possibility of submitting an offer in compromise, but did not pursue this option.12 
Instead, after some negotiations, the IRS placed Applicant’s account in an uncollectible 
status based on his then yearly salary of $100,000. Notwithstanding that Applicant’s 
compensation has more than doubled in the past five years, he remains in an 
uncollectible status. He does not have an installment agreement with the IRS.13  
 
Applicant initially testified that he made voluntary payments to the IRS to pay 
down his federal tax debt. He then corrected his testimony to note that he had not 
forwarded any payments to the IRS in the past five years, because it would result in his 
account going from uncollectible to active repayment status. He further stated that if he 
were on an IRS repayment plan, he could not satisfy his financial obligations on the 
monthly stipend of about $1,800 that the IRS would allow him to keep.14  
 
Applicant also initially testified that in the past five years the IRS had intercepted 
his income tax returns and applied the refunds against the balance due on his federal 
tax liability from 2003 – 2007. After being questioned by Department Counsel, Applicant 
corrected his testimony to note that he had not had a tax refund in several years.15  
 
During his May 2014 security clearance background interview, Applicant told the 
investigator that he was working with the IRS, through his tax attorney, to resolve the 
federal tax debt. He promised to resolve the debt within two years. He provided no 
documentation of having made any payments, whether voluntary or involuntary, towards 
the satisfaction of the more than $230,000 federal tax debt and associated tax liens.16

 Applicant testified that his current plan to resolve the federal tax debt is to sell the 
rental property in State A and use the sale proceeds to pay down the debt.17 Applicant 
anticipated the property would be sold in “July or August of this summer.”18 He expected 
the sale would generate on the “low end” $150,000.19 He would then forward the sale 
proceeds to the IRS “no later than September [2016].”20 He further expected, based on 
likely bonuses, distributions, and the sale of the property to fully satisfy the federal tax 
debt by April 2017.21 Applicant’s plan is contingent on maintaining his security 
clearance.22 He presented no evidence post-hearing updating the status of the sale of 
the property in State A and the federal tax debt. During his testimony, Applicant noted 
that once he started to repay the tax debt, the IRS would reassess the amount he owed. 
He estimates the tax debt has increased to about $250,000.23 
 
Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). Individual applicants are eligible for access to 
classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest” to authorize such access. E.O. 10865 § 2. 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance, an 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions. The guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies the guidelines in a  
commonsense manner, considering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a 
fair and impartial decision.  
 
Department Counsel must present evidence to establish controverted facts 
alleged in the SOR. Directive ¶ E3.1.14. Applicants are responsible for presenting 
“witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by 
the applicant or proven . . . and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a 
favorable clearance decision.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  
 
Administrative judges are responsible for ensuring that an applicant receives fair 
notice of the issues raised, has a reasonable opportunity to litigate those issues, and is

not subjected to unfair surprise. ISCR Case No. 12-01266 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2014). 
In resolving the ultimate question regarding an applicant’s eligibility, an administrative 
judge must resolve “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information . . . in favor of national security.” AG ¶ 2(b). Moreover, recognizing 
the difficulty at times in making suitability determinations and the paramount importance 
of protecting national security, the Supreme Court has held that “security clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of 
trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. 
Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may 
deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions 
entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than 
actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The financial considerations security concern is explained at AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 The security concern under this guideline is not limited to a consideration of 
whether an applicant with financial problems might be tempted to compromise classified 
information or engage in other illegality to pay their debts. It also addresses the extent 
to which an applicant’s delinquent debts cast doubt upon their judgment, self-control, 
and other qualities essential to protecting classified information.24 Accordingly, a judge 
“must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, judgment, and 
other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the vulnerabilities 
inherent in the circumstances.” ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016). 
 
Applicant’s accumulation of a significant amount of delinquent consumer debt 
and back taxes raises the financial considerations security concern. The record 
evidence also establishes the disqualifying conditions listed at AG ¶¶ 19(a), “inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations.”  
 
                                                          
24 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May. 1, 2012).

 Once disqualifying conditions are established, the burden shifts to Applicant to 
present evidence demonstrating extenuation or mitigation sufficient to warrant a 
favorable security clearance decision. ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 4 (citing Directive ¶ 
E3.1.15). The guideline lists a number of conditions that could mitigate the concern. I 
have considered all the mitigating conditions, including the following: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c):  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
AG ¶ 20(d):  the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  
 
AG ¶ 20(e):  the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the 
legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and 
provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from the non-tax-related SOR 
debts. AG ¶¶ 20(d) and 20(e) apply to these SOR debts. 
 
 On the other hand, although AG ¶¶ 20(a) through 20(d) have some applicability 
in assessing the security concerns arising from the federal tax debt and associated tax 
liens, said mitigating conditions are insufficient to mitigate the serious security concerns 
arising from this longstanding and sizeable federal tax debt. In reaching this conclusion, 
I considered that the federal tax debt and associated liens arose from unusual 
circumstances. Namely, Applicant was provided bad advice that his earnings as a USG 
contractor working in a designated combat zone were not subject to state or federal 
income taxes. Furthermore, Applicant experienced several other life events after 
returning from overseas that were primarily outside of his control, which negatively 
impacted his finances. Additionally, he has resolved or is resolving other debts that 
became delinquent during the period of time he experienced financial trouble.  
 
 However, this and other favorable record evidence is undercut by the fact that it 
has been over five years now since Applicant was notified by the IRS of the sizeable 
federal tax debt. Before and after being notified of the tax debt, Applicant earned 
 
8 
 
 
significant compensation from his employment as a federal contractor. His salary as a 
federal contractor has never fallen below six figures. Even in 2009, when Applicant was 
out of work for a few months, his yearly income was approximately $135,000. His 
income has more than doubled in the past five years, with reported 2014 and 2015 
earnings of more than $200,000.25 Accordingly, the record evidence reflects that 
Applicant has had the financial means to start repaying his federal tax debt for some 
time, but has been unwilling to make the personal financial sacrifices necessary to start 
repaying the debt. Even after Applicant was made aware over a year ago when the 
SOR was issued that the federal tax liens raised a security concern, which could 
negatively impact his ability to continue in his present role with his company, he took no 
action to resolve the liens.  
 
 Instead of reaching out to the IRS to establish a payment plan to resolve his 
federal tax debt, Applicant has essentially made a promise to resolve the debt in the 
future. A promise that is contingent on Applicant maintaining his security clearance. 
Applicant’s promise, no matter how sincere, is insufficient to rise to the level of 
responsible action contemplated by the second prong of AG ¶ 20(b). His promise is also 
insufficient to mitigate the serious security concerns raised by Applicant’s longstanding 
and sizeable federal tax debt.26  
 
 Additionally, as keenly pointed out by Department Counsel at hearing, it is 
unclear regarding the extent to which Applicant’s current finances are under control.27 
Notwithstanding Applicant and his girlfriend’s testimony about his modest and frugal 
lifestyle, Applicant failed to adequately explain how he spends approximately $10,000 in 
net monthly income that leaves him with nearly nothing in discretionary income to 
address his federal tax debt. Applicant’s testimony and the record evidence leave me to 
question whether he has truly reformed his past financial habits that, in part, contributed 
to his current financial circumstances. In short, Applicant failed to demonstrate that his 
current financial situation is under control and the security-significant issues present in 
this case are unlikely to recur. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of all the relevant 
                                                          
25 See Answer, Encl. 3, Applicant’s Affidavit (“In 2014, my W-2 showed a salary of $236,000 with an 
additional $55,000 - $60,000 in profit distributions.”); Tr. 25-26; Ax. T at 3 (2015 earnings were more than 
$210,000.) 
 
26 See generally, ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (Board explained the heightened 
security concerns raised by tax-related financial issues, as follows:  “A security clearance represents an 
obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor 
other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and 
ability to protect classified information.”). See also, ISCR Case No. 11-04176 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 17, 
2012) (Promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying 
debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner). 
 
27 See Tr. 115-118, 153-155.

circumstances, to include the factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a). I hereby incorporate my 
comments under Guideline F and highlight some additional whole-person factors. 
 
 Applicant has honorably served this country, in and out uniform, since at least 
1997. His service has included multiple long-term deployments to designated combat 
zones. He has held a security clearance without issue for nearly twenty years, and was 
upfront and candid about his financial problems, including his tax-related issues, from 
the start of the security clearance process. This and other favorable record evidence, 
including the character reference letter Applicant submitted from one of his business 
partners and the testimony of his girlfriend, raise favorable inferences regarding 
Applicant’s character. However, after weighing the favorable record evidence against 
the serious security concerns raised by Applicant’s longstanding and sizeable federal 
tax debt and the legal requirement that all doubts raised by the evidence must be 
resolved in favor of national security, I find that Applicant failed to meet his burden of 
proof and persuasion for continued access to classified information.28  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct)        AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.e, 1.h – 1.m:       For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.f – 1.g:         Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant continued access to classified 
information. Applicant’s request for a security clearance is denied.
