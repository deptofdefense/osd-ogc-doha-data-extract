HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) includes 17 allegations of delinquent 
debts and dismissal of Applicant’s bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy 
Code. While circumstances beyond his control damaged his finances, he did not show 
enough progress paying his debts to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. 
Access to classified information is denied.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On May 3, 2013, Applicant completed and signed his Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) 
On February 8, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
   
 
2 
 
 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). 
 
On March 3, 2016, Applicant responded to the SOR. On March 25, 2016, 
Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On March 26, 2016, Department Counsel 
filed an amendment to SOR ¶ 1.l changing the creditor to the U.S. Government, and the 
mechanism of enforcement of the debt was changed to a lien. (HE 2) Applicant did not 
object to the amendment to SOR ¶ 1.l. (Transcript (Tr.) 14-15) On May 24, 2016, the 
case was assigned to me. On June 7, 2016, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for June 24, 2016. (HE 
1) Applicant waived his right under the Directive to 15 days of notice of the date, time, 
and location of his hearing. (Tr. 13-14) His hearing was held as scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits, and Applicant 
offered four exhibits, which were admitted without objection. (Tr. 16-21; Government 
Exhibit (GE) 1-5; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-D) On July 5, 2016, DOHA received a copy of 
the transcript of the hearing. The record was held open for additional evidence until May 
2, 2016. (Tr. 74-75, 77) No post-hearing evidence was received. 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d 
through 1.n, and 1.p through 1.r. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.o. 
He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are 
accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 43-year-old senior systems administrator, who has worked for his 
employer since 2007. (Tr. 6, 8; GE 1)  In 1991, he graduated from high school. In 1997, 
he received a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, and in 1999, he received a 
master’s degree in applied mathematics. (Tr. 7) In 2009, he received a master’s degree 
in business administration. (Tr. 7) He has not served in the military. (Tr. 7) In 2003, he 
married, and in 2010, he divorced. (Tr. 7) In 2013, he married. (Tr. 7) He has a nine-
year-old daughter. (Tr. 8) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Prior to Applicant’s divorce, he had an ownership interest in five properties. (Tr. 
26) In 2009, Applicant and his spouse began the divorce process. (Tr. 22) Applicant’s 
temporary monthly child support requirement was $1,800. (Tr. 22) In 2009, Applicant 
took an early withdrawal from his retirement plan, which resulted in a $26,000 federal 
income tax debt. (Tr. 24) In 2010, his monthly child support payment was reduced to 
$1,428. (Tr. 22) After the divorce, Applicant owned two properties, and he had a one-
                                            
1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

half interest in the third property with his former spouse. (Tr. 24) The divorce decree 
required the sale of the shared property. (Tr. 24)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a mortgage delinquent in the amount of $49,451. From August 
2012 to March 2015, Applicant did not pay make his monthly mortgage payments, and 
nonpayment of his mortgage qualified Applicant for a mortgage modification. (Tr. 27-28) 
Applicant lives in this property. The mortgage balance is $349,000, and it is current. (Tr. 
28-29; AE A at 4-6) The unpaid mortgage payments were rolled into the new modified 
mortgage. (Tr. 28-29) Some of his $1,506 monthly payments were late because the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was garnishing his pay. (Tr. 29) His monthly payment 
under the new modified mortgage plan is $1,575. (AE A at 4) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b for $63,362 and 1.c for $20,204 are delinquent mortgages for 
Applicant’s rental property (rental property A). (Tr. 32) In November 2011, the tenant in 
rental property A died, and for six months Applicant did not receive any rental income 
from this property because his other tenants, who were being evicted, refused to pay 
their rent. (Tr. 22, 31) It took 12 additional months for Applicant to make the necessary 
repairs and renovate rental property A. (Tr. 23, 31; AE A at 8) In December 2014, the 
creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c informed Applicant that the creditor intended to write-off the debt 
as a loss. (AE A at 6) The SOR ¶ 1.c creditor provided an IRS Form 1099 reflecting the 
debt was discharged. (Tr. 33) Applicant declared the income on the IRS Form 1099 on 
his 2015 tax return. (Tr. 46) 
 
The other debts in the SOR are as follows: ¶ 1.d bank debt ($19,106); ¶ 1.e 
student loan debt ($18,601); ¶ 1.f bank debt ($17,420); ¶ 1.g bank debt ($6,829); ¶ 1.h 
bank debt ($5,694); ¶ 1.i bank debt ($5,009); ¶ 1.j medical debt ($130); ¶ 1.k medical 
debt ($87); ¶ 1.l federal tax debt ($26,519); ¶ 1.n bank debt ($5,282); ¶ 1.o 
telecommunications debt ($141); ¶ 1.p medical debt ($104); ¶ 1.q medical debt ($88); 
and ¶ 1.r medical debt ($75). Applicant used some of the money from the banks to 
make repairs on his rental properties. (Tr. 34) He did not make any payments to any of 
these creditors, except he was making payments to address the tax debt in SOR ¶ 1.l, 
and he said he paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.o. (Tr. 35-36)  
 
The SOR ¶ 1.l tax debt has increased to $48,000 because Applicant has 
delinquent taxes from 2013 in addition to the lien for his 2009 taxes. (Tr. 39) On May 9, 
2016, the IRS wrote Applicant that he owed $36,367 for tax year 2009, and he was 
credited $181 for his overpayment for 2015. (AE A at 2) He is currently making monthly 
payments to the IRS of $576. (Tr. 40; AE B-D) He made all of his monthly tax payments 
in 2015. (Tr. 45) 
 
Applicant’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed in 2013 because Applicant 
erroneously believed he was excused from attending court on a date when he was out 
of the country getting married. (Tr. 40-41) He decided not to refile the bankruptcy. (Tr. 
41) His current spouse has been unemployed for one year. (Tr. 42) Applicant has about 
$300 to $500 left at the end of each month; however, he is using those funds to make 
   
 
4 
 
 
repairs on his spouse’s rental property. (Tr. 42-43) Applicant has about $21,000 in his 
retirement fund. (Tr. 43) 
 
Applicant said he intends to pay his creditors. (Tr. 44; AE A at 8) He is 
considering refiling his bankruptcy. (Tr. 44, 49)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
   
 
5 
 
 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;” and “(g) failure to file annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required . . . .” Applicant’s history of 
delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, SOR response, and hearing record.  
 
When Applicant filed his 2009 federal income taxes, he failed to pay his taxes in 
full as required by law. Three mortgage accounts, six bank accounts, one education 
account, one tax debt, and four medical accounts were or are delinquent. The 
Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) 
requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. 
  
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
  
   
 
6 
 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   
   
 
7 
 
 
Applicant presented some important mitigating information. Several 
circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his finances: Applicant and his 
spouse divorced; the court imposed heavy child support responsibilities; Applicant had 
problems with his tenants and his rental properties; and the value of his real estate 
holdings declined in value when the real estate market suffered a precipitous decline 
about ten years ago. However, he did not provide enough specifics about how these 
circumstances adversely affected his finances, and he did not show that he acted 
responsibly to address his delinquent debts after his divorce became final. He received 
some financial counseling as part of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy.      
 
Applicant receives credit for making payments in accordance with his IRS 
payment plan for more than one year. This positive information does not fully mitigate 
his failure to pay his federal income taxes for tax year 2009 when those taxes were due. 
Moreover, his 2009 federal income tax debt was not fully paid at the time of his hearing. 
The DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly emphasized the importance of timely payment 
of U.S. Government debts. See ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) 
(stating “A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not 
demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted 
access to classified information”) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 14-05476 at 5 
(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 
2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).  
 
The Appeal Board commented that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has 
purportedly corrected [the applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] 
is now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful 
consideration of [a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding 
prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility.” See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 
3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, no foul” approach to an 
Applicant’s course of conduct and employed an “all’s well that ends well” analysis as 
inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing 
of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
Applicant is credited with mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a (creditor indicates 
debt is current), 1.c (creditor released Applicant from liability), and 1.o (paid). He is not 
credited with mitigating the other SOR debts because he did not provide any 
documentation showing enough progress paying the debt or a reasonable dispute of 
any debts, such as copies of letters to the SOR creditors and credit reporting companies 
disputing his responsibility for any debts. 
   
There is insufficient evidence about why he was unable to make greater 
documented progress resolving more of his SOR debts. There is insufficient assurance 
that his financial problems are being resolved, are under control, and will not recur in 
the future. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish that financial 
considerations security concerns are mitigated.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a 43-year-old senior systems administrator, who has worked for his 
employer since 2007. He has received a bachelor’s degree and two master’s degrees.  
In 2003, he married, and in 2010, he divorced. In 2013, he married. He has a nine-year-
old daughter. Circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his finances, 
including divorce, substantial child support responsibilities, problems with his tenants, 
and his rental properties, and the decline in the real estate market.    
 
Applicant is credited with mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.o. The 
dismissal of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy alleged in SOR ¶ 1.m is mitigated because it 
was due to confusion about whether he had to attend a hearing. He is not credited with 
mitigating his income tax debt because it relates to his 2009 federal income taxes, and 
he has not made sufficient progress reducing the magnitude of his federal income tax 
debt over the past five years.   
 
Applicant has a lengthy history of delinquent debt. His SOR alleges and the 
record establishes: six delinquent bank debts; four delinquent medical debts; a 
delinquent student loan debt; and a tax debt not completely paid from tax year 2009. He 
is not credited with mitigating the SOR debts in ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d through 1.n, and 1.p through 
1.r because he did not provide documentation showing enough progress paying these 
debts or reasonable disputes of these debts.   
 
Applicant did not provide enough specifics about how circumstances beyond his 
control adversely affected his finances, and he did not show that he acted responsibly to 
address his delinquent debts. His failure to make greater progress resolving his SOR 
   
 
9 
 
 
debts shows lack of financial responsibility and judgment and raises unmitigated 
questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified 
information. See AG ¶ 18. More documented financial progress is necessary to mitigate 
financial considerations security concerns.   
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to 
Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a 
determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for 
award of a security clearance in the future. With more effort towards documented 
resolution of his past-due debts, and a track record of behavior consistent with his 
obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security 
clearance worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. I conclude that financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. It is 
not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility at this time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraph 1.a:     For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d through 1.l:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.m:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.n:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.o:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.p through 1.r:  Against Applicant 
 
  
   
 
10 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
