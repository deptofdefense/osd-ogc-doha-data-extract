LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for
access to classified information. He has a history of financial problems or difficulties due
to a business dispute followed by a business failure during the period of 2007–2008. He
met his burden to present sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate the financial
considerations security concern. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on December 4, 2012.  About three years later on September1
26, 2015, after reviewing the application and information gathered during a background
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).

investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD)  sent Applicant a statement of reasons2
(SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to3
a complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action under the security guideline known as
Guideline F for financial considerations. He answered the SOR with a four-page
memorandum on November 2, 2015. Subsequently, on January 20, 2016, Department
Counsel amended the SOR by adding an unpaid county tax lien as ¶ 1.d. Applicant
answered the amended SOR on March 9, 2016.          
The case was assigned to me on March 21, 2016. The hearing was held as
scheduled on May 25, 2016. Department Counsel submitted Exhibits 1–7, which were
admitted. Applicant submitted Exhibits A–E, which were admitted. Applicant testified on
his own behalf. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on June 3, 2016.
The record was kept open until June 27, 2016, to allow Applicant to submit
additional documentation. He made a timely submission, and the two additional matters
are admitted without objections as Exhibits F and G.   
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 54-year-old program manager for a company engaged in the
defense industry.  He has a bachelor’s degree in a field of engineering. He is married4
with two children in their early 20s. He has worked for his current employer since 2012.
He relocated his family to their state of current residence in 2011, and he had a cross-
country commute until 2012. Before that, he was self-employed during 2010–2012 as
the president of an audio-video design and integration business. Before that, he was
employed during 2008–2010 as a managing director for a similar business. And before
that, he was self-employed during 2002–2008 as president and owner of his own
company.  
Applicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties tied to the period of
2002–2008 when he owned and operated his own company. Under Guideline F, the
SOR, as amended, alleges the following matters: (1) a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case
ending in discharge in 2011; (2) an unpaid state tax lien for $2,386 filed in 2012; (3) an
unpaid state tax lien for $8,629 filed in 2008; and (4) an unpaid county tax lien for
 Exhibit 3. 5
 This section of the findings of fact is based on Applicant’s answer to the SOR, his hearing testimony, and6
documentary evidence. He gave a detailed explanation of the circumstances in his answer to the SOR as well
as during his background investigation.

$4,478 filed in 2011. He presented testimonial and documentary evidence for those
matters as described below.
SOR ¶ 1.a–Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. The bankruptcy court records show
that Applicant received a discharge of his indebtedness in October 2011.  His5
bankruptcy case included (1) $417,299 in secured claims on Schedule D, (2) $2,696 in
unsecured priority claims on Schedule E, and (3) $139,166 in unsecured nonpriority
claims on Schedule F. It also included real property and personal property valued at a
total of about $380,581, as reflected on Schedules A and B. 
Applicant explained that his personal bankruptcy in 2011 followed a sequence of
events that began with the founding of his company in 2002.  His company provided6
low-voltage wiring, automation systems, and entertainment systems primarily in new
home construction. In 2007, the company ceased doing business when it was sold and
merged into another company in the same line of business. The transaction was a
stock-purchase agreement. In exchange for stock, the acquiring company assumed the
assets and liabilities of Applicant’s company. He received company stock (which is now
worthless), not cash, and was hired as vice-president with the intention of becoming
president in 2008.  
The deal unraveled quickly. Applicant explained that the acquiring company
misrepresented their financial condition, did not disclose certain liabilities that they had
in another deal with a previously acquired company’s president, which if known, it likely
would have resulted in Applicant not agreeing to the acquisition. 
Things came to a head in about April 2008, when the majority shareholder placed
a hold on all bank accounts, withdrew most of the money from accounts, and filed a
claim to all of the company’s assets. Without operating capital, the board of directors (of
which Applicant was a member) voted to seek bankruptcy protection for the company,
although the majority shareholder voted against it. The majority shareholder then sought
to have the bankruptcy petition dismissed with the goal of selling the company’s assets
and negotiating with selected creditors. During that period, the majority shareholder
locked and denied access to facilities, hid assets, and defaulted on final wages.
Eventually, the bankruptcy court dismissed the company’s petition, and the majority
shareholder then liquidated assets to his benefit and defaulted on a number of liabilities.
Due to these circumstances, Applicant was faced with liabilities for trade accounts
payable, leases, sales taxes, vehicle loans, and other business-related debts. 
Applicant was able to find other employment in a similar industry in May 2008,
with a business who agreed to help him service his customers. Applicant brought along

many of his customers to the new business, which allowed him to make a living and
support his family. Applicant believes the majority shareholder made material if not
fraudulent misrepresentations during the acquisition and merger. He consulted several
attorneys about bringing a civil action against the majority shareholder, but he
concluded the expected cost was too high to run the risk of never collecting on a time-
consuming lawsuit. As a result, he resolved his indebtedness in the 2011 Chapter 7
bankruptcy case as noted above. 
SOR ¶ 1.b–state tax lien for $2,386. Applicant paid $6,026 in October 2015 to
resolve the lien for tax period 2010 and other tax periods with his state of former
residence.  Documentation shows the lien was paid, satisfied, and ordered cancelled in7
November 2015. He explained his delay in addressing the lien was due to a
combination of inattention and a concerted effort to bury a negative experience while
focusing on getting a fresh start in his state of current residence.  8
SOR ¶ 1.c–state tax lien for $8,629. This debt stems from sales taxes incurred
by Applicant’s company during 2002–2005, which became due after an accounting
reclassification of certain income. Applicant disputes personal liability for this debt, and
he does not intend to pay it as a matter of principle. He disputes the debt because it
was a liability assumed by the acquiring company in the 2007 acquisition and merger.
Documentation—the agreement and plan of merger with attached schedules—shows
that the sales taxes owed from 2002–2005 were listed as a long-term liability of his
company.  Applicant stated that the state department of revenue has made no attempts9
to contact him, and if the state elected to pursue collection, he would hire an attorney
and challenge it.   10
SOR ¶ 1.d–county tax lien for $4,478. Applicant believes this lien is a duplicate
based on information he received over the telephone from county tax officials.11
Documentation shows the lien was paid, satisfied, and ordered cancelled in April 2011.12
Applicant’s current overall financial situation is stable.  His annual salary is13
$145,000, and he received a $7,000 bonus this year. He spouse is employed as a
public school teacher earning about $34,000 annually. He has a 401(k) account with his

current employer with a balance of about $55,000, but no other investment accounts
due to the previous business failure and bankruptcy. 
Applicant was respectful and serious during the hearing, and he conducted
himself like a gentleman throughout. His recollection of his financial history was
hampered by the passage of time since the 2007–2008 business dispute and business
failure as well as his own efforts to put the episode in the past. Overall, I found
Applicant’s testimony to be credible and worthy of belief. 
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As14
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt15
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An16
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  17
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting18
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An19
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate20
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  21

In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a
preponderance of the evidence.  The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s22
reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence
standard.23
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it24
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant25
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 26
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  27
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It
 AG ¶¶ 19(a) and (c).28
 AG ¶ 20(a)–(f).29
7
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties as well as an inability to satisfy debts.  That conclusion is28
supported by Applicant’s admissions to the SOR allegations and the documentary
evidence.  
 In mitigation, I have considered the six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,29
and the following are most pertinent:  
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
AG ¶ 20(c) [t]here are clear indications that the problem is being resolved
or is under control;
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
AG ¶ 20(e) the [person] has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions taken to resolve the issue. 
Applicant receives credit under those four mitigating conditions. The evidence
shows his financial problems are linked to the 2007–2008 period, when he sold his
company, had a dispute with the majority shareholder of the acquiring company, and
then the acquiring company failed, saddling him with liabilities. In other words, there is
no evidence suggesting that his financial problems were caused by frivolous or
irresponsible spending, consistent spending beyond one’s means, poor self-control, or
other issues of security concern. The worst thing to say about Applicant is that he may
have exercised flawed or poor business judgment when he agreed to the acquisition
and merger in 2007. He considered suing the majority shareholder for making material
misrepresentations and fraud, but he eventually concluded that bankruptcy in 2011 was
his best course of action. 
Throughout this period, Applicant continued working, as a salaried employee or
self-employed, until beginning his current position with a defense contractor in 2012.

Together with his spouse, they are now making a substantial income, about $180,000
annually, which has provided them with a degree of financial stability after their
bankruptcy. He resolved two of the tax liens at issue (one in 2011 and another in 2015).
He disputes liability for the third lien, he has a reasonable basis for the dispute, and he
provided documentation to support the basis for his dispute. Overall, the evidence
shows that Applicant’s financial problems were caused by the business failure, which
was a circumstance largely beyond his control and it is unlikely to recur. He also acted
responsibly under difficult circumstances. Applicant impressed me as a serious,
responsible, and trustworthy person. Further, I am persuaded that his financial problems
or difficulties that were caused by the business failure are not a true and accurate
reflection of his current fitness and suitability for access to classified information. 
Applicant’s history of financial problems or difficulties does not create doubt
about his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect
classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice
versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I30
conclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified
information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.d: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
