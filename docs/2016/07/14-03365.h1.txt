GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 19, 2007, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 He submitted another e-QIP on January 30, 2013.2 On 
December 12, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified

(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to 
Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and 
other determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006.  
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on January 6, 2015. On January 29, 2015, Applicant 
responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have his case decided on the written 
record in lieu of a hearing.3 A complete copy of the Government’s file of relevant 
material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant on June 1, 2015, and he was afforded an 
opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and 
submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, 
Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Guidelines applicable to 
his case. Applicant received the FORM on December 29, 2015. Applicant timely 
submitted documentation in response to the FORM on two occasions. Department 
Counsel did not object to the documents which were marked as Applicant items (AI) A 
through E. The case was assigned to me on February 17, 2016.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with brief comments all of the 
factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.j.). 
Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After 
a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a 
superintendent with his current employer since July 2009. He was previously in a variety 
of different positions (senior project manager, construction manager, security specialist, 
design engineer, senior installation technician, and alarm technician) with other 
employers since May 2000.4 Applicant was terminated from his job in November 2005 
because he expressed a dislike for it, and he remained unemployed, supported by 
unemployment compensation and credit cards until January 2006.5 He is a 1989 high 
school graduate.6 Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy (active reserve) in August 1990 
and was honorably discharged in July 1996.7 He was granted a top secret (TS) security

clearance in 1990, and he retained it until December 2011 when his application for a TS 
security clearance with access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) was 
denied for reasons explained below.8 Applicant was married the first time in May 1992 
and divorced in June 1994.9 He married again in July 2009 and separated in August 
2012.10 He has two sons born in 1992 and 2005, as well as a daughter born in 2001.11  
 
Financial Considerations12 
  
It is unclear when Applicant first experienced financial difficulties, but in reviewing his 
comments to investigators from the Defense Security Service (DSS)
13
 as well as the Office 
of Personnel Management (OPM),
14
 it appears that Applicant had significant financial 
problems as far back as the 1990’s associated with his first marriage. In 1994, his wages 
were garnished for child support. In October 2000, after his fiancée informed him that she 
was pregnant, Applicant obtained a credit report to gather his debt information to create a 
budget. He realized for the first time the depth of his financial problems. He had estimated 
that he had $10,000 in debt, but soon realized that his debts were actually approximately 
$23,000.  
 
With an annual salary of $38,000, Applicant sought guidance from credit counselors 
and an attorney. He was faced with three options: (1) obtain a consolidation loan, or as he 
stated it, go into debt to get out of debt; (2) make monthly payments of $300 to $350 to his 
creditors, something he was unable to afford; and (3) file for bankruptcy. Applicant chose 
the latter of the three choices, and in March 2001, he filed a voluntary petition for 
bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, contrary to his statement that he 
had filed under Chapter 13. A May 2001 credit report revealed seven past-due accounts 
worth $11,440; two liens or judgments worth $7,780; and eight collection or charged-off

accounts worth $17,064.
15
 By June 2001, Applicant’s annual salary had increased to 
$54,500.
16
 Applicant’s unsecured, nonpriority debts were discharged in July 2001.
17
  
 
Although Applicant’s financial difficulties were resolved by his 2001 bankruptcy 
discharge, by 2004, he reverted to his past financial practices, and accounts started to 
become past due. Credit card accounts were frozen or closed for being past due; a 
mortgage became delinquent; child support again fell into arrears; and a jewelry store 
account was charged off.
18
 By August 2007, Applicant’s finances fell further into disarray. 
Applicant attributed his new financial problems to: (1) purported nonspecific medical 
problems that caused him a loss in pay; (2) reliance on credit cards “to meet the demands 
of life,” upon being released from work; and (3) an inability to find employment.
19
 Judgments 
were obtained against him in April 2008 ($2,801.67)
20
 and April 2010 ($744.48),
21
 and 
another judgment for $1,442.33 was converted to a state tax lien in July 2010.
22
 
 
In August 2011, the Department of the Navy (DON) CAF took the initial steps to 
deny Applicant eligibility for access to SCI, based on financial considerations. The DON 
CAF SOR identified nine delinquent accounts worth $150,258.
23
 Applicant replied to that 
SOR and attributed his financial problems to: (1) mismanagement of his funds; (2) his 
failure to fully understand the true status of his finances and how to properly work with it; 
and (3) irresponsibility.
24
 He contended that he had again spoken with a financial counselor 
and was taught how to manage his money and debt, and that the knowledge he had gained 
will assist him in avoiding the same financial predicament. He indicated he would meet with 
his financial counselor to discuss his options. Applicant intended to contact his creditors and 
start working to resolve the largest debts first. He claimed to have a budget that would give 
him approximately $500 per month to pay creditors. He intended to develop payment plans 
with each of his creditors, and he explained it would be a long-term process to resolve his 
debts.
25
 The information submitted to the DON CAF was not sufficient to generate a change 
of the earlier decision. Accordingly, on December 14, 2011, the DON CAF issued Applicant 
a letter of denial (LOD). The basis for the decision was essentially as follows:
26

. . . you did not submit any documentation which reflects you have resolved, 
reduced or addressed each delinquent account listed in [the SOR]. Your 
actions indicate an inability or unwillingness to resolve your debts, which 
contributes to a whole person assessment of questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. 
 
In January 2013, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he acknowledged having 
financial difficulties and identified several delinquent accounts as well as a number of 
unpaid parking tickets which were issued as early as 2007 and 2008. He noted that he 
had met with several unidentified financial specialists to discuss his credit issues, and 
he stated:27  
 
I have learned how to properly manage my money. I have developed a 
budget and stuck to it for the better part of a year. I have sat down and 
created a plan to repay all my debt over the course of the next 4 or 5 
years. I contacted my mortgage company and I am in the process of 
setting up a short sale to sell my home and be relieved of this debt.  
 
Applicant was interviewed again by an investigator from OPM in March 2013. During 
that interview, Applicant attributed his financial problems to: (1) his August 2012 separation 
from his wife; (2) giving his wife sixty percent of his salary; (3) the downturn in the housing 
market; and (4) his financial mismanagement.
28
 He contended that he had paid a number of 
creditors various amounts of money over the period of a few years, but failed to submit any 
documentation to support his contentions. His purported attempts to set up repayment plans 
with some creditors were supposedly rejected. He also offered no documentation to support 
the existence of those efforts.  
 
One common theme throughout Applicant’s 2007 OPM interview, 2011 personal 
appearance, 2013 e-QIP, 2013 OPM interview, and his 2015 Answer to the SOR, was his 
stated intentions to pay the debts in full, and his contentions that he had actually made 
payments to various creditors. His professed main goals were: (1) maintain his current 
budget; (2) maintain a positive and strong payment status with his current debt; (3) not incur 
any new debt; (4) utilize additional money when possible to reduce old debt; (5) utilize travel 
money with his new position to reduce old debt; and (6) if he receives a raise, to maintain 
his current budget and use the extra money to pay off debt. He did none of the above. 
 
Applicant stated that he had spent much of 2015:
29
  
 
trying to get bills organized and paid off. [He] worked closely with a couple of 
the debtors and was slowly paying them off. Towards the end of the summer 
[he] talked with a couple of different credit counselors and they all told [him] 
basically the same thing. The high amount of debt versus the limited funds 
[he has] to pay it off, [his] smartest more was to apply for bankruptcy.

Instead of paying his debts, in November 2015, Applicant filed a voluntary petition for 
bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, claiming up to $50,000 in 
estimated liabilities.
30
 Applicant’s unsecured, nonpriority debts were discharged in January 
2016.
31
  
 
In his January 2015 Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that his monthly net 
income was $2,880, and his monthly expenses were $2,870, leaving only $10 for 
discretionary saving, investing, or spending.
32
 In his November 2015 voluntary petition, he 
contended his monthly net income was $3,012.71, and his monthly expenses were $2,940, 
leaving only $72.71 for discretionary saving, investing, or spending.
33
 Among his claimed 
monthly expenses were $60 for boat insurance, and $380 for a boat slip fee.
34
 He also 
noted that his 2015 gross income through mid-November 2015 was $79,805.72; his 2014 
gross income was $106,919; and his 2013 gross income was $106,038.
35
 
  
In preparation for his bankruptcy filing, in September and October 2015, Applicant 
received internet and telephone counseling on debt education and personal financial 
management.
36
 Despite his repeated references to other financial counselors, Applicant 
failed to submit documentation to support any contention that financial guidance was 
received from any such entity. 
 
The SOR identified ten purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, totaling 
approximately $55,587. Those debts were as follows: a judgment for $2,861.67 issued in 
2008 (SOR ¶ 1.a.);
37
 a default judgment for $744.48 issued in 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.b.);
38
 an 
internet account for $623 (SOR ¶ 1.c.); a utility account for $246 (SOR ¶ 1.d.); a charge 
account for $3,600 (SOR ¶ 1.e.); a Veterans Administration real estate mortgage with a 
balance of $143,745 that was past due $43,983 and foreclosed upon (SOR ¶ 1.f.);
39
 a 
military exchange charge account with a balance of $3,793 that was past due $360 (SOR ¶ 
1.g.); a jewelry store account for $2,765 (SOR ¶ 1.h.); and two parking ticket debts owed to 
the local municipalities in the amounts of $205 (SOR ¶ 1.i.) and $200 (SOR ¶ 1.j.).

As noted above, although Applicant repeatedly indicated that he was “paying” certain 
accounts, he failed to submit any documentary evidence of those purported payments. 
There is no documentary evidence as to when those “payments” started, to which creditors 
they were made, or what the unpaid balances before his bankruptcy discharge might have 
been. Applicant’s failure to submit more details related to the specific debts discharged by 
his most recent bankruptcy makes it impossible to determine which of the above debts were 
discharged and which were not. This is especially significant because certain types of debts 
are not discharged in bankruptcy. While not alleged in the SOR, Applicant also had a 
judgment on a state tax lien for $1,442.33 entered in 2010,
40
 and a judgment on an 
unspecified lien for $2,990.71 entered in 2014.
41
 Under the circumstances, it is difficult to 
determine if Applicant’s finances are under control or if he is still experiencing financial 
difficulties despite his recent bankruptcy discharge. Accordingly, in the absence of 
evidence to the contrary, it appears that Applicant’s financial problems are not under 
control.  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”42 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”43   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.

In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”44 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.45  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”46 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”47 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

 Cir. 1994).

Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant has had a long-standing problem with his finances which 
started as early as the 1990’s, and which is apparently continuing. Various accounts 
were placed for collection, judgments and liens were entered against him, and a house 
was foreclosed. Unsecured, nonpriority debts were discharged in July 2001 and again in 
January 2016. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
    
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”48  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) minimally applies. None of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. 
The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing multi-year period of 
financial difficulties since the 1990’s make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long 
                                                          
48
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

ago” or “was so infrequent.” With the exception of his internet and telephone counseling 
on debt education and personal financial management in connection with his most 
recent bankruptcy filing, Applicant’s claimed relationships with financial counselors have 
never been fully explained or supported by documentation. Thus, it is insufficient to 
raise more than a minimal application of AG ¶ 20(d). Over the years, Applicant 
attributed his financial problems to a differing variety of factors: (1) purported 
nonspecific medical problems that caused him a loss in pay; (2) reliance on credit cards 
“to meet the demands of life,” upon being released from work; (3) an inability to find 
employment; (4) his financial mismanagement; (5) his failure to fully understand the true 
status of his finances and how to properly work with it; (6) irresponsibility (7) his August 
2012 separation from his wife; (8) giving his wife sixty percent of his salary; and (9) the 
downturn in the housing market. Without some explanation as to the specific issues 
identified, how they were supposedly beyond his control, and some description of the 
impact on his ability to maintain his monthly payments, two of the identified factors take 
on added significance: financial mismanagement and irresponsibility. 
 
Over the years, Applicant made a variety of promises about his intentions and 
said the right things as to what he had learned regarding financial management. After 
his 2001 bankruptcy discharge, he contended that he had spoken with financial 
counselors and was taught how to manage his money and debt, and that the knowledge 
he had gained would assist him in avoiding the financial predicaments. Subsequently, 
when he was again faced with financial problems, he said he would meet with his 
financial counselor to discuss his options; he would contact his creditors and start 
working to resolve the largest debts first; he had a budget that would give him 
approximately $500 per month to pay creditors; and he intended to develop payment 
plans with each of his creditors. In 2013, he again claimed he had learned how to 
properly manage his money, and had developed a budget and stuck to it for the better 
part of a year. He said he had created a plan to repay all his debt over the course of the 
next 4 or 5 years. He failed to submit documentation to support any of his claims and 
contentions. Instead, it appears that Applicant never initiated a good-faith effort to make 
any payments on his delinquent accounts. He continued to avoid the payment of his 
debts for a number of years, and once again, sought the protections of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code for the second time in 15 years.  
 
Security clearance adjudications are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The 
adjudicative guidelines do not require an applicant to establish resolution of each and 
every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve 
financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no 
requirement that an applicant immediately resolve or make payments on all delinquent 
debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in an SOR be 
paid first. Rather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the 
payment of such debts one at a time. In this instance, there are alleged plans to resolve 
financial problems, but there is no documentation to support the existence of such 
plans. There were purported actions taken and some claimed payments made to some 
creditors, but there is no documentation to support the existence of Applicant’s actions 
or payments. Instead, there is some documentation reflecting bankruptcies. Applicant 
 
11 
                                      
 
has not acted responsibly by failing to address his delinquent accounts.49 Applicant’s 
lengthy period of inaction, except for the two bankruptcy petitions, under the 
circumstances confronting him cast substantial doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment.50 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.51   
     
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He has been 
with his current employer since July 2009. He served honorably with the U.S. Navy for 
six years. He was granted a TS security clearance in 1990, and he retained it until 
December 2011. There is no evidence of criminal conduct, security violations, or the 
misuse of information technology systems. 
 
The disqualifying evidence is more substantial. Largely due to Applicant’s 
financial mismanagement and irresponsibility, various accounts became delinquent and 
were placed for collection.  Judgements were obtained against him and liens were filed. 
A house was foreclosed. Although he repeatedly declared his intentions to contact his

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

creditors and resolve his delinquent accounts, there is little evidence that he did so. He 
contended that repayment plans had been established and payments made for some of 
his accounts, but he failed to furnish documentation to confirm the establishment of 
repayment plans or payments made. Despite years of making promises of positive 
action, he failed to offer any documentation to support his claimed actions. In 2011, the 
DON CAF determined that because of his financial problems and his failure to provide 
necessary documentation sufficient to mitigate the financial considerations alleged 
against him, he was not eligible for access to SCI. Faced with continuing financial 
problems, Applicant sought the protection of bankruptcy discharges in 2001 and 2016. 
Without knowing which accounts were recently discharged and which accounts remain, 
and without more recent information regarding Applicant’s current income and monthly 
expenses, it is impossible to determine if his finances are under control. Applicant’s 
unsubstantiated actions regarding positive resolution efforts, and his repeated 
bankruptcy petitions, under the circumstances cast substantial doubt on his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:52 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of ‘“meaningful track record” necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has failed to demonstrate a “meaningful track record” of voluntary debt 
reduction and elimination efforts, in only resolving some of his delinquent debts by 
bankruptcy discharges, but without any proven efforts to actually pay his creditors. He 
failed to indicate which of his delinquent accounts, if any, listed in the SOR were 
affected by the most recent bankruptcy. Without supporting documentation, I cannot 
credit him with any positive efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts.

13 
                                      
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.j:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
