GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding personal 
conduct. Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 28, 2013, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On March 18, 2015, 
the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel 
Security Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation); DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns 
under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was

unable to make an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether to grant or 
continue Applicant’s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract 
with the Department of Defense, and recommended referral to an administrative judge 
to determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. In a notarized statement, inadvertently dated April 12, 2014,2 Applicant responded 
to the SOR allegations, but she neglected to make her selection as to the process 
desired.3 She was subsequently requested to make a selection, and on May 19, 2015, 
she elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.4 A 
complete copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to 
Applicant on August 14, 2015, and she was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 
30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of 
the Directive, as well as the Guidelines applicable to her case. Applicant received the 
FORM on September 9, 2015. The response was due on October 9, 2015. On an 
unspecified date before the due date, Applicant submitted her response to the FORM 
along with several documents which were accepted without objection and marked as 
Applicant Items (AI) A through AI E. For clarity purposes, the documents attached to 
Applicant’s Answer to the SOR were marked as AI F through AI L. The case was 
assigned to me on October 27, 2015.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted both of the factual allegations 
pertaining to personal conduct in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b.).5 Applicant’s admissions 
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been 
serving as a referral specialist with her current employer since February 2013.6 She was 
previously employed in various positions by a medical provider from February 2008 until 
                                                          
2
 It should be noted that the affidavit form upon which Applicant was to choose either a hearing or a decision 
based upon the administrative record, and list her contact information, and which the notary public was to sign, was a 
boilerplate preprinted form with “2014” furnished by the DOD CAF. The correct date should be “2015.”

 Item 2 (Supplement to Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, dated May 19, 2015). 
 
5
 It should be noted that the SOR was drafted in such a manner that there were two allegations in Paragraph 
1 and one allegation in Paragraph 2 that were essentially identical in that they identified the same Guideline and 
facts. While Department Counsel noted that Applicant had neither admitted nor denied the allegation in Paragraph 2, 
he failed to address the obvious duplication in the allegations.

she was laid off in December 2012.7 She was unemployed from mid-December 2012 
until she assumed her current position.8 Applicant graduated from high school in June 
1976, and she attended community colleges over a multi-year period, but did not 
receive a degree.9 She has never served with the U.S. military.10 She was never 
granted a security clearance,11 and it is unclear if she ever held a public trust position. 
Applicant has never been married.12  
 
Personal Conduct 
 
 Applicant acknowledged in her e-QIP that in 2011 she had two accounts placed 
for collection.13 During her OPM interview, she discussed additional delinquent 
accounts.14 She indicated that all of the delinquent accounts were either being paid or 
had already been satisfied.15 Applicant’s most significant problem, however, as reported 
in her e-QIP, discussed by her during her interview, and alleged in the SOR, related to 
her failure to timely file several state and federal income tax returns. 
 
Applicant failed to timely file her state and federal income tax returns for the tax 
years 2009, 2010, and 2011.16 Her initial reasons for not doing so for 2009 were: “I did

 Item 2, supra note 3, at 1. The legal requirement to file a federal income tax return is based upon certain 
conditions, including an individual’s gross income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that there 
is an obligation to so file, the following applies: 
 
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title or by 
regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any 
information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such 
records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in 
addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction 
thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned 
not more than 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. In the case of any person with 
respect to whom there is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such 
person with respect to such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with 
respect to such failure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the first 
sentence of this section shall be applied by substituting "felony" for "misdemeanor" and "5 years" 
for "1 year".

not have all the information needed at the time. . . I requested an extension but never 
filed.”17 Her initial comments pertaining to 2010 were somewhat inconsistent. She said 
she had filed her federal return but not her state return, adding “I am in the process of 
getting information gathered in order to file for state for this year. Fed have been filed.”18 
Applicant’s initial comment pertaining to 2011 was “I did not file. . . in 2011 because I 
needed help in filing.”19 One month later, during her OPM interview, Applicant stated 
that her only explanation was “that she just let things go and did not file her taxes, or 
pay her listed debts. She will file all her delinquent tax returns by April 15, 2013.”20  
 
By the time Applicant filed her Answer to the SOR, her explanations took on 
more substance. She added:21 
 
Life circumstances seem to choke out the best of intentions. 
Originally the return for 2009 was not filed just because time [and] lack of 
the proper paperwork prevented me from filing. After a 4 month hospital 
stay my father passed away in Oct. 2007. My sister [and] I had cared for 
him for a few years prior [and] his death left us both in depression [and] 
things just got left by the wayside. The following years did not get better 
[and] unfortunately my taxes were one of the things that got left undone. 
Life circumstances [and] the urgency of the immediate take their toll. 
 
Health issues in my family have also played a part. I had a growth 
in my neck which required a partial removal of my thyroid with an effect of 
fatigue. A heart attack just after obtaining my current position has left me 
tired [and] stressed. 
 
Family matters include a veteran brother both sick [and] homeless 
[and] unwilling to get help. My sister has various health issues [and] has 
been out of work for over 2 years. We get by but the stress of these 
matters leaves me feeling weary [and] exhausted. Good intentions fall by 
the wayside unfortunately. 
 
When she submitted her Response to the FORM, Applicant included additional 
information in her explanations for her failures to timely file her income tax returns. She 
added some controversy by contending that she had filed her income tax returns for 
2010 before she commenced her current position in February 2013.22 She also included

a timeline from 2007 through 2013 in which she described the various family physical 
and mental health issues related to her father, sister, brother, and herself.23  
 
Applicant filed her federal income tax returns for 2009 on April 12, 2015;24 for 
2010, on some date shortly before December 31, 2012;25 and for 2011, on April 1, 
2015.26 None of the income tax returns were filed timely. She filed her state income tax 
returns for 2009 on either April 12, 2015 or June 24, 2015;27 for 2010, on either April 12, 
2015 or May 19, 2015;28 and for 2011, on either April 1, 2015 or April 30, 2015.29 There 
is no evidence that Applicant has received counseling related to the filing of her income 
tax returns. 
 
Work Performance 
 
 Since assuming her current position, Applicant has received a number of 
certificates attesting to her outstanding performance throughout the period October 
2013 through August 2015.30 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”31 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. Positions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as “sensitive

positions.”32 “The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is 
that, based on all available information, the person’s loyalty, reliability, and 
trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security.”33 Department of Defense contractor 
personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any 
final unfavorable access determination may be made.34  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a public trust 
position. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”35 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.36  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the

possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  
Furthermore, security clearance determinations, and by inference, public trust 
determinations, should err, if they must, on the side of denials.37 In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set 
out in AG & 15:       
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
 The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. 
Under AG ¶ 16(d), it is potentially disqualifying if there is 
 
credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other 
guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, 
but which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-
person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not 
properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited 
to consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. . . .  
 
Under AG ¶ 16(e), it is also potentially disqualifying if there is 
personal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, that 
creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . . 
engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person’s personal, 
professional, or community standing. . . . 
 Applicant failed to timely file her federal and state income tax returns for 2009, 
2010, and 2011. AG ¶¶ 16(d) and 16(e) have been established.

8 
                                      
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate 
trustworthiness concerns arising from personal conduct. AG ¶ 17(c) may apply if “the 
offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it 
happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, AG ¶ 17(e) 
may apply if “the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability 
to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.” 
  
AG ¶¶ 17(c) and 17(e) do not apply. As noted above, Applicant’s failures to 
timely file her state and federal income tax returns were neither infrequent nor under 
unusual circumstances; they constituted a routine practice that continued to occur over 
a multi-year period. Applicant simply failed to determine the urgency, or generate the 
motivation, to comply with the law in a timely manner, explaining that that she just let 
things go because of a variety of family physical and mental health issues that arose in 
2007 and continued until 2015. Life experiences such as unemployment, illness, or 
death are recognized as potential short-term impediments to meeting deadlines, but 
they are not a blank check for such a multi-year period of inaction. Moreover, at the 
same time she was unable to comply with the filing mandates, Applicant was performing 
her employment duties in an exceptional manner, resulting in accolades from her 
employer. Applicant’s actions, or chronic inaction, reflect a somewhat cavalier attitude 
towards her legal responsibilities for timely filing income tax returns, as well as her 
questionable judgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with established rules 
and regulations. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public 
trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.38

 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
9 
                                      
 
 There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. She has been 
with her current employer since February 2013, and has received accolades over the 
ensuing years for outstanding performance. There is no evidence of misuse of 
information technology systems, mishandling protected information, or substance 
abuse. She is a caring individual who remains concerned for the welfare of her siblings. 
In 2015, after lengthy delays, Applicant finally filed her state and federal income tax 
returns for the tax years 2009 through 2011.  
  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial 
than the mitigating evidence. There is no evidence from third-parties as to her current 
reputation for reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant routinely failed to 
timely file her federal and state income tax returns over a multi-year period. Although 
Applicant was aware of her failures, and the government’s interest in them, she failed to 
make timely efforts to address her taxes after being interviewed by OPM. She promised 
to have her income tax returns filed by April 15, 2013, but except for the federal income 
tax return for the tax year 2010, they were not. The SOR was issued on March 18, 
2015. She responded to the SOR on April 12, 2015. Yet, despite the repeated warnings 
of the significance of her issue, Applicant generally failed to generate the motivation to 
comply with the law related to the remaining state and federal income tax returns until 
April 2015.  
 
Applicant has demonstrated a very poor track record of timely filing federal and 
state income tax returns. While they may be understandable over the short-term, her 
explanations for those failures over the long-term are simply not credible. Overall, the 
record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from her personal 
conduct. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility to 
occupy a public trust position to support a contract with the Department of Defense. 
Eligibility is denied.
