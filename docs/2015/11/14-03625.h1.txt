FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), raised by Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal and state income 
tax returns and the resulting tax debts. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant had filed 
all past-due tax returns and settled his federal and state tax debts. Eligibility for access 
to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on October 18, 2012. On 
December 18, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006.  
 
 Applicant answered the SOR on January 27, 2015, denied all the allegations, 
and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. (Tr. 7.) Department Counsel 
2 
 
was ready to proceed on July 6, 2015, and the case was assigned to me on July 13, 
2015. On July 28, 2015, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified 
Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for August 26, 2015. Applicant hired an 
attorney on August 19, 2015, and his attorney requested that the hearing be postponed. 
I granted the request. On September 8, 2015, DOHA notified Applicant’s attorney that 
the hearing was rescheduled for September 23, 2015. I convened the hearing as 
rescheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without 
objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through K, which 
were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 1, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 61-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for 
his current employer since January 2003. He worked for the same employer from July 
1996 to October 1999, and he took a leave of absence to work as the executive director 
of a non-profit organization from October 1999 to January 2003. 
 
 Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from February 1974 to 
October 1996, when he retired as a major. (Tr. 83.) He received a security clearance in 
May 1980 and held it throughout his Air Force career. While on active duty, he attended 
college full time for a year through the “boot strap” program and obtained a bachelor’s 
degree in November 1979. After he returned to full-time active duty, he obtained a 
master’s degree in business and management in 1987. (GX 2 at 8; Tr. 22-23.) 
 
 Applicant married in December 1973. He and his wife have an adult daughter. He 
attended marriage counseling from March to September 2000 due to difficulty 
communicating with his wife. He stopped attending counseling because his wife refused 
to participate. (GX 5 at 24; GX 6 at 2.)  
 
 When Applicant applied for a revalidation of his security clearance in July 2006, 
he disclosed in his SCA that he owed about $12,000 in federal income taxes for tax 
year 2000 and that his wages were garnished for $2,400 in state income taxes in 2004. 
(GX 5 at 28.) He told a security investigator that he failed to file his state income tax 
returns for four or five years, but that he was not worried because he did not owe any 
taxes for those years. The state’s computation of $2,400 in taxes due did not reflect 
deductions to which he was entitled. After he filed his state tax returns, the $2,400 
collected by garnishment was refunded. According to the investigator’s summary of the 
interview, Applicant attributed his failures to timely file to laziness and overwork. (GX 6 
at 3.) At the hearing, he disagreed that he attributed his dereliction to laziness, but he 
agreed that he was overworked, trying to keep the non-profit organization solvent, and 
trying to keep up with work when he returned to his job with a federal contractor. (Tr. 55-
56.) The record evidence is sparse regarding the circumstances causing Applicant’s 
federal tax debt in 2004, but his failures to file state tax returns and his federal tax debt 
did not result in a revocation of his security clearance.  
 
3 
 
From 2005 to 2009, Applicant’s nephew lived with him, stole money from him, 
and was arrested for shoplifting. He also had two foster children living in his home. 
During the same time, his adult daughter attempted suicide. His did not timely file his 
federal and state income tax returns from 2005 to 2009, and he attributed it to family 
stress, depression, and a demanding job.1 (GX 2 at 11; Tr. 80-82.) 
 
In 2009, Applicant was diagnosed with congestive heart disease and atrial 
fibrillation. (Tr. 26, 58.) In November 2011, Applicant and his mother both were 
diagnosed with cancer. His mother passed away on April 10, 2012. In June or July 
2012, Applicant began treatment, including chemotherapy and radiation, and continued 
treatment until 2014. His treatment was complicated because of his weakened heart 
condition. His treatment left him weakened, exhausted, and sometimes confused. (Tr. 
26-27, 73.) 
 
Applicant timely filed his 2010 federal and state tax returns, but he did not timely 
file his 2011 returns. He did not request an extension of time to file his 2011 returns, 
because his mother passed away five days before the due date for his 2011 returns. 
(Tr. 60.) The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a substitute tax return on his behalf 
for 2011. He did not timely file his returns for 2012.  
 
In August 2014, Applicant engaged the services of a tax professional, and he 
filed his 2011 federal return, reflecting that he owed $4,793; his 2012 federal return, 
reflecting that he owed $6,190; and his 2013 federal return, reflecting that he owed 
$5,815. (AX D, E and F; Answer to SOR; Tr. 38-44.). His 2011 and 2012 federal income 
tax returns were returned because they were not signed. He resubmitted them in 
September 2014. (Tr. 30-31; AX B at 1; AX C at 2.) He filed his state income tax return 
for 2012 in October 2014. (GX 2 at 31.) He filed his past-due tax returns after he 
learned that he could not refinance his house until he brought his tax accounts up to 
date. (Tr. 31.) He filed an amended return for tax year 2011 in September 2015, 
removing his nephew as a listed dependent and reflecting that he owed $4,339. (AX G; 
Tr.45-47.)  
 
 Applicant testified that no one in the family could have assisted with filing the 
federal and state taxes while he was undergoing treatment. Although he told a security 
investigator in June 2013 that his wife wrote the checks for federal and state taxes, he 
testified at the hearing that he handles the family finances. (GX 2 at 10; Tr. 58.) I 
interpreted his testimony as saying that he made the family financial decisions but relied 
on his wife to make the payments on the family debts. 
 
                                                          
1 Applicant’s failures to timely file his federal and state returns for 2000 to 2009 and his resulting tax debts 
were not alleged in the SOR. However, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an 
applicant=s credibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate 
evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has 
demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 
at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered the unalleged conduct for these limited purposes.

 When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in June 2013, he 
believed he owed about $30,000-$35,000 in state and federal taxes for 2009 and 2010. 
He withdrew $20,000 from his 401(k) retirement account to pay his taxes. (GX 2 at 10.) 
His federal income tax transcript reflects that he made a $4,689 payment to the IRS on 
January 14, 2013; but it does not reflect what year or years to which the payment 
applied. For tax year 2013, Applicant made a $2,300 payment on February 26, 2015; 
and a $3,000 payment on April 20, 2015. For tax year 2012, Applicant made a $310 
payment on January 14, 2015; a $2,300 payment on January 26, 2015; a $3,000 
payment on April 20, 2015; and a $2,577 payment on June 15, 2015. (AX B at 2.) For 
tax year 2011, he made a $6,190 payment on January 2, 2015. (AX C at 2.) In July 
2015, he was notified by the IRS that he owed $22,723 for tax year 2012. (AX H; Tr. 
48.) 
 
Between January and September 2015, Applicant made six payments to the IRS 
totaling about $35,600. His Electronic Federal Tax Payment System printout reflects 
that his federal tax debts for tax years 2011 through 2013 have been settled. (AX I.) 
 
 Applicant’s state tax debt was partially satisfied by applying tax refunds to the 
debt. He satisfied the remaining debt by making five payments of $150 that began in 
October 2014. (GX 2 at 13-14.) 
 
 As of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not filed his federal and state returns 
for 2014, but he had requested an extension, because he was awaiting distribution of 
the assets from his mother’s estate, and he was unsure whether the revenue earned 
from his mother’s properties would affect his taxes for 2014. (Tr. 79.) However, he knew 
he would owe taxes for 2014, and he made a $6,000 payment in April 2015 toward his 
expected tax liability. (AX J; Tr. 74.) The final accounting for his mother’s estate was 
filed on August 2, 2015, and it reflects that he inherited $1,000. (AX K.) 
 
The transcript does not reflect Applicant’s hesitant manner of speaking during the 
hearing and his long pauses before answering questions. After counsel for both sides 
completed their questioning of Applicant, I asked him if he still had problems with mental 
confusion, and he responded that he still has problems with recalling information. (Tr. 
85-86.)  
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
5 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The SOR alleges that Applicant owes about $4,575 in federal income taxes for 
tax year 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.a); has not filed his federal income tax return for 2012 (SOR ¶ 
1.b); has not filed his federal income tax return for 2011; and owes about $27,354 for 
2011 (SOR ¶ 1.c). It also alleges that he has not filed his state income tax return for 
2012 (SOR ¶ 1.d), and owes about $1,078 in state taxes for 2011 and 2013 (SOR ¶ 
1.e). 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 The documentary evidence and testimony presented at the hearing established 
the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts”); AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial 
obligations”); and AG ¶ 19(g) (“failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax 
returns as required . . . .”).  The following mitigating conditions under this guideline are 
potentially applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
7 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s untimely filings and tax debts are 
recent, frequent, and did not occur under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is partially established. Applicant attributed his failures to timely file 
his federal and state income tax returns in part to his chaotic family life, i.e., 
communication problems with his wife and the conduct of his nephew and daughter, 
which were conditions largely beyond his control. He voluntarily undertook the 
responsibility for two foster children and the demands of his job. He has not explained 
why he did not address his past-due returns when he filed his federal and state returns 
in 2010. However, his bout with cancer and the debilitating treatment regimen from 
November 2011 to mid-2014, causing weakness, exhaustion, and mental confusion, 
were conditions beyond his control. He acted responsibly by resolving his tax problems 
when he sufficiently recovered from the physical and mental effects of his medical 
problems. He made a payment on his tax debt in January 2013, filed his past-due 
federal tax returns in August 2014, and filed his past-due state return in October 2014. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is established. Applicant engaged the services of a tax professional, 
filed all his past-due returns, and satisfied his federal and state tax debts. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is established. Applicant began making payments on his tax debts in 
January 2013, well before he received the SOR. He has complied with his federal and 
state payment plans, and his tax debts have been resolved.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(e) is not established. Applicant denied all the allegations in the SOR, 
and he disagreed with some of the IRS computations of his tax debt, but he has paid all 
the taxes claimed by the IRS and the state tax authorities. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
8 
 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. He appears to still 
suffer from the physical and mental consequences of his medical problems. He has 
served the United States for 41 years, in and out of uniform, and has held a security 
clearance during most of his service. Rather than being irresponsible, he has been 
overly responsible, taking on more than he can handle, i.e., a troubled nephew, two 
foster children, a struggling non-profit organization, and a demanding primary job. He 
has obtained professional help in dealing with his tax problems, and he appears to have 
learned the importance of being proactive, as evidenced by his prepayment of $6,000 
for tax year 2014. 
 
 A security clearance adjudication is not a tax-collection procedure. It is an 
evaluation of an individual’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case 
No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole 
person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his tax 
problems. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.e:    For Applicant 
 
9 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted.
