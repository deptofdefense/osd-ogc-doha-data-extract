HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges seven debts, totaling $15,268 
and discharge of his unsecured nonpriority debts under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy 
Code in June 2010. His SOR debt for $6,426 is in an established payment plan, and the 
current balance is $3,616. His four medical SOR debts were discharged in his 2010 
bankruptcy. Two debts totaling $975 are unresolved. He has an established track record 
of paying his debts. Financial considerations concerns are mitigated. Access to 
classified information is granted.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On February 27, 2014, Applicant completed and signed an Electronic 
Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86). (Item 3) On April 20, 
2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) 
issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865,  
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF made a preliminary decision to 
deny or revoke Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. Specifically, the 
SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline.

On July 1, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he waived his right to a 
hearing. (Item 2) On August 17, 2015, Department Counsel completed the File of 
Relevant Material (FORM). On September 28, 2015, Applicant received the FORM. 
Applicant provided an undated response to the FORM.1 On October 27, 2015, 
Department Counsel stated she had no objection to the Applicant’s FORM response. 
On November 5, 2015, the case was assigned to me. The Government’s case consisted 
of eight exhibits. (Items 1-8)  
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations. He also 
provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted 
as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 36-year-old shipyard employee, who is seeking a security 
clearance.3 In 1998, he received a high school diploma, and he has not attended 
college. He served in the Navy from September 1998 to April 2008. When he left active 
duty, he was a petty officer second class (E-5), and he received an honorable 
discharge.  He worked as a security guard or security officer from July 2011 to 
September 2011, and from March 2011 to July 2011. He was self-employed from June 
2009 to August 2009. In 2006, Applicant married. His children were born in 2007, 2008, 
and 2009. There is no evidence of any security violations, alcohol abuse, use of illegal 
drugs, or criminal conduct. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant said the cause of his financial problems was unemployment. In August 
2009, he left his employment to care for his spouse who was ill. He had three 
substantial periods of unemployment after leaving the Navy in 2008. Applicant was 
unemployed from March 2012 to September 2013, from August 2009 to March 2011, 
and from April 2008 to June 2009.    
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, SF-86, 
SOR response, and FORM response. His SOR alleged seven debts, totaling $15,268 
and discharge of his delinquent debts under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in June 
2010. The status of the seven SOR debts is as follows: 
                                            
1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated September 15, 
2015, and Applicant’s receipt is dated September 28, 2015. The DOHA transmittal letter informed 
Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt to submit information.   
 
2Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this 
section is his Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), SOR response, 
and his February 27, 2014 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86).

SOR ¶ 1.a is an unresolved bank credit card debt for $488; SOR ¶ 1.b is an 
unresolved telecommunications debt for $487; and SOR ¶¶ 1.c to 1.e are three medical 
debts for $234, $115, and $101. According to Appellant’s March 15, 2014 credit report, 
the three medical debts were discharged in his bankruptcy.     
 
SOR ¶ 1.f is a judgment for $6,426. In 2012, Applicant purchased a van and 
financed it with a loan for $15,084.4 Three months later, Applicant returned the van to 
the seller because he could not afford the payments due to unemployment. The van 
was sold at auction for $9,127. In 2014, Applicant paid $3,539 to the creditor, and 
starting in December 2014, he made monthly payments of $200 each month.5 As of 
September 2015, he owed the creditor $3,714. Progress was reduced because interest 
continued to accrue at an annual rate of 17%. This debt is in an established payment 
plan. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g is a judgment for $7,417. Applicant’s March 2014 credit report shows 
this judgment was adjudged in November 2010. (Item 6) Applicant’s October 2014 
credit report shows the debt was medical in origin and was adjudged on November 1, 
2010. (Item 7) The identity of the original creditor is not indicated in the credit reports, 
and when the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator interviewed 
Applicant, he said he was unaware of this debt. (Item 4) Schedule F of Applicant’s June 
2010 bankruptcy shows multiple medical debts originating in 2006 and 2007 including 
some notices to medical creditors without amounts and two debts from the same 
medical entity for emergency treatment, totaling $4,900. (Item 5) The totality of the 
evidence supports a conclusion that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g existed before June 2010, 
and accordingly, it was resolved in Applicant’s June 2010 bankruptcy. See note 8, infra.   
 
The February 27, 2010 summary of schedules for Applicant’s bankruptcy 
indicates: real property of $0; personal property of $11,940; creditors holding secured 
claims of $29,900; unsecured nonpriority claims of $87,419; current income of $450; 
and current expenditures of $450.6 (Item 5) The only secured properties are Applicant’s 
two vehicles, which he valued at $21,000. (Item 5) Applicant received financial 
counseling as part of the bankruptcy process. In June 2010, Applicant’s unsecured 
nonpriority debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
                                            
4The information in this paragraph is from an account statement the creditor provided. (FORM 
response) 
  
5In Applicant’s SOR response, he said he had an established payment plan addressing the debt 
in SOR ¶ 1.f. Department Counsel’s FORM emphasized the absence of corroborating documentation 
showing the payment plan and history. Applicant submitted an account history from the creditor.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No.

02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt 
is documented in his credit reports, SF-86, bankruptcy schedules, SOR response, and 
FORM response. Applicant’s SOR alleges, and the evidence establishes seven 
delinquent debts, totaling $15,268 and discharge of his delinquent debts under Chapter 
7 of the Bankruptcy Code in June 2010. The Government established the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible 
applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;7 and  
                                            
7The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:

EXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA 
Exemption 6 applies                                             
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
 AG ¶¶ 20(a) through 20(c) apply. Applicant’s financial problems were adversely 
affected when his spouse was ill, and he had to leave his employment to care for her. 
He had three substantial periods of unemployment. His spouse’s medical problems and 
his unemployment are conditions largely beyond his control. He acted responsibly under 
the circumstances in June 2010, when all of his delinquent nonpriority unsecured debts 
were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code8 and by establishing a 
payment plan in 2014 for his largest remaining SOR debt before he received the SOR. 
                                                                                                                                            
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
   
8There is some duplication of debts in Applicant’s bankruptcy schedules. In a bankruptcy filing, 
most debtors list potential creditors, even when the debt may have been resold or transferred to a 
different collection agent or creditor, to ensure notice, and reduce the risk of subsequent dismissal of the 
bankruptcy. If Applicant failed to list some nonpriority unsecured debts on his bankruptcy schedule, this 
failure to list such debts does not affect their discharge. Absent fraud, in a no-asset bankruptcy, all 
unsecured, nonpriority debts are discharged when the bankruptcy court grants a discharge, even when 
they are not listed on a bankruptcy schedule. See Judd v. Wolfe, 78 F.3d 110, 114 (3d Cir. 1996); Francis 
v. Nat’l Revenue Service, Inc., 426 B.R. 398 (Bankr. S.D. FL 2010), but see First Circuit Bucks Majority

Exemption 6 applies                                             
 
 Applicant received financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process. His 
negative financial situation “occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to 
recur and does not cast doubt on the [Applicant’s] current reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment.” The problem is being resolved or is under control. Applicant did not 
provide documentation showing he disputed any of his SOR debts, and AG ¶ 20(e) 
does not apply to any of his SOR or bankruptcy-listed debts.      
  
In sum, Applicant has an established payment plan for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e 
($6,426), and the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c ($234), 1.d ($115), 1.e ($101), and 1.g ($7,417) 
were discharged in June 2010 through bankruptcy, leaving two debts totaling $975 that 
Applicant should address. His resolution of his two largest delinquent debts shows 
sufficient effort, good judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability to warrant mitigation of 
financial considerations concerns. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
The rationale for approving Applicant’s clearance is more substantial than the 
reasons for denying his clearance. Applicant is a 36-year-old shipyard employee, who is 
seeking a security clearance. In 1998, he received a high school diploma, and he has 
not attended college. He served in the Navy from September 1998 to April 2008. When 
                                                                                                                                            
on Discharge of Unlisted Debt in No-Asset Case, American Bankruptcy Institute, 28-9 ABIJ 58 (Nov. 
2009). There is no requirement to re-open the bankruptcy to discharge the debt. Collier on Bankruptcy, 
Matthey Bender & Company, Inc., 2010, Chapter 4-523, ¶ 523(a)(3)(A). Some categories of priority 
obligations are listed on bankruptcy schedules, but are not discharged by bankruptcy, such as tax debts, 
student loan debts, and child support obligations.

he left active duty he was a petty officer second class, and he received an honorable 
discharge.  Applicant was unemployed from March 2012 to September 2013, from 
August 2009 to March 2011, and from April 2008 to June 2009. Applicant is married, 
and he has three children. There is no evidence of any security violations, alcohol 
abuse, use of illegal drugs, or criminal conduct.  
  
 Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances in June 2010, when all of 
his delinquent nonpriority, unsecured debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code. He has two currently delinquent unresolved debts, totaling $975. He 
understands that he needs to pay his debts, and the conduct required to retain his 
security clearance.        
 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:  
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence 
of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant 
is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted).  
 
Applicant understands what he needs to do to establish and maintain his 
financial responsibility. His efforts at debt resolution have established a “meaningful 
track record” of debt re-payment. I am confident he will resolve the remaining debts on 
his SOR when he is financially able to do so, and he will maintain his financial 
responsibility.9 
                                            
9The Government has the option of following-up with more questions about Applicant’s finances. 
The Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit reports, 
investigation, and interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the Government from 
subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the security 
significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative security 
significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). Violation of a promise made in a 
security context to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may

Exemption 6 applies                                             
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:  For Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

Administrative Judge 
                                                                                                                                            
support future revocation of a security clearance. An administrative judge does not have “authority to 
grant an interim, conditional, or probationary clearance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 
2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 04-03907 
at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006) (stating, “The Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or 
probationary security clearance to allow her the opportunity to have a security clearance while she works 
on her financial problems.”). This footnote does not imply that this decision to grant Applicant’s security 
clearance is conditional.
