Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke an existing security
clearance to work in the defense industry. He has a history of financial problems or
difficulties due to circumstances largely beyond his control. He has acted responsibly
under the circumstances, and he has initiated a good-faith effort to repay his delinquent
debts. He presented sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate his problematic financial
history. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on March 3, 2013.  After reviewing the application and1
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

(DOD),  on July 28, 2014, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it2
was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him
eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint. It3
detailed the reasons for the action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for
financial considerations. Applicant answered the SOR on September 12, 2014, and
requested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Subsequently, on
May 18, 2015, Applicant changed his mind and requested a hearing, which was not
opposed by Department Counsel.   4
The case was assigned to me on July 8, 2015. The hearing was held as
scheduled on July 29, 2015. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1–6, and they were
admitted. Applicant offered Exhibits A, F–J, J/K, and L–W, they were admitted.  Other5
than Applicant, neither party called any witnesses. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was
received on August 6, 2015.
The record was kept open until August 26, 2015, and then extended to
September 9, 2015, to allow Applicant to submit additional documentary matters.
Applicant made a timely submission on September 4, 2015, and those matters are
admitted without objections as Exhibits X–CC. 
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 44-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance
previously granted to him. He is employed as a technical writer and editor for a major
defense contractor. He has worked for the same company since 1999. He has a good
employment record, which includes handling hundreds of sensitive documents with zero
discrepancies.  6
Applicant has a history of financial problems, which he does not dispute. The
SOR allegations consist of 16 collection accounts or charged-off accounts for a total of
 Exhibits 5, 4, and 6, respectively. 7

about $23,000. Thirteen of those accounts are for less than $1,000. And 8 of the 16
accounts are collection accounts stemming from necessary medical care or treatment.
Applicant disputes the $342 medical collection account in SOR ¶ 1.e, due to a
disagreement with the dental services provided to his child and he has no intention of
paying it. Otherwise, he admits the alleged debts, which are also established by credit
reports from 2013, 2014, and 2015.7
Applicant traces his financial problems or difficulties back to 2012 when his wife
became ill and was required to leave her employment and go on disability.  Her health8
improved and she returned to work but was subsequently laid off and forced to seek
other employment. She received unemployment compensation for a period.  She9
returned to work in about September 2014.  In addition, Applicant’s mother-in-law and10
father-in-law moved into his household so they could help care for his father-in-law who
was experiencing dementia. They remained in the household until his father-in-law fell
and injured himself resulting in placement in a rehabilitation nursing home where he
passed away. Applicant has also spent a large amount of money on automobile repairs.
During 2011–2015, he spent a total of about $7,388 for repairs on a 2001 vehicle or on
a 2002 vehicle.11
Applicant presented extensive and detailed documentation showing that he has
resolved or is in the process of resolving numerous delinquent debts. To date, of the 16
debts in the SOR, he has paid or settled 8 accounts, he entered into repayment
arrangements for 6 accounts, he disputes a $342 medical collection account, and
another account was not traceable through the creditor and was deleted from his credit
file. The current status of each debt in the SOR is summarized in the table below.

debts.  He also presented a detailed monthly budget showing payments for recurring12
expenses as well as payments for the repayment arrangements.  His monthly budget13
shows a positive net remainder of about $326. 
Applicant earns an annual salary of about $78,000.  He also picked up a part-14
time job working weekends to earn extra money that he uses to repay the delinquent
debts.  He and his wife have reduced or limited their expenses by eliminating all dining15
out, by limiting hobbies to things around the house, by eliminating travel or vacations,
and by reducing recurring expenses such as cable TV.  His plan is to continue making16
the monthly payments per the repayment arrangements and look for opportunities to
settle a debt by making an affordable lump-sum payment.17
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As18
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt19
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An20
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  21

financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In

surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation

There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting22
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An23
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate24
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme25
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.26
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.27
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it28
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant29
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 30

Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  31
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly compromise
classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It encompasses
concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important qualities. A
person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or
negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. Taken together, the evidence indicates inability or unwillingness
to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning32 33
of Guideline F. 
 In mitigation, I have considered six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and34
I have considered the following as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or death, divorce, or
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control; and
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
Applicant fell behind and defaulted on many of his financial obligations due to
circumstances largely beyond his control as described in the findings of fact, but I am
persuaded that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. He is in the process
of recovering from the difficult financial situation he found himself in. To date, of the 16
debts in the SOR, he has paid or settled 8 accounts, he entered into repayment

arrangements for 6 accounts, he disputes a $342 medical collection account, and
another account was not traceable through the creditor and was deleted from his credit
file. He has provided extensive and detailed documentation of his interactions with his
creditors. His monthly budget indicates that he has sufficient cash flow to adhere to his
repayment arrangements, which has been assisted by taking on a part-time job. For all
these reasons, I conclude that there are clear indications that Applicant’s financial
problems or difficulties are being resolved or under control, and that he has initiated a
good-faith effort to repay his delinquent debts. 
Of course, the purpose of this case is not aimed at collecting debts.  Rather, the35
purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness
consistent with the guidelines in the Directive. In evaluating Guideline F cases, the
Appeal Board has established the following standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of a meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant
actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement
that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.36
Here, the evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has established a plan and is
taking steps to implement that plan sufficient to mitigate the concern. The actions he
has taken establish actual debt reduction as well as a track record of progress showing
a favorable upward trend.  
Applicant’s history of financial problems no longer creates doubt about his
reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In
reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the
favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due
consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I conclude that he met his37
9
ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.p: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is
granted.
