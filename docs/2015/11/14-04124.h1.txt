Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke a security
clearance to work in the defense industry. He has a history of financial problems or
difficulties consisting of charged-off credit card accounts for more than $100,000, and
those matters are largely unresolved. He did not present sufficient evidence to explain
and mitigate his problematic financial history. Accordingly, this case is decided against
Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on March 3, 2014.  After reviewing the application and1
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

(DOD),  on November 12, 2014, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR),2
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to a3
complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action under the security guideline known as
Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant answered the SOR on January 20,
2015, and requested a hearing.  
The case was assigned to me on May 1, 2015. The hearing was held as
scheduled on June 4, 2015. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1–4, and they were
admitted. Applicant offered Exhibits A–AA, and they were admitted. Other than
Applicant, neither party called any witnesses. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received
on June 12, 2015.
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 56-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance
previously granted to him in 2008. He is employed as a mid-level manager in facilities
maintenance and safety for a major defense contractor and industrial corporation. He
has worked for the same company since 2008. He has numerous favorable references,
and he has a good employment record.  For example, in his current job, he has been4
promoted 11 times since 2008, and he went from a beginning annual salary of about
$65,000 to about $100,000.5
Before his current job, Applicant worked for a brewery during 2006–2008. Before
that, he worked for about 28 years in the automobile industry until his departure in 2006
was necessitated due to his employer’s bankruptcy. His educational background
includes a bachelor’s degree awarded in 2003, which he earned over a period of years
while working full-time in the automobile industry.6

Applicant is married, and he and his spouse have two adult children. His spouse
was also employed in the automobile industry, but she has not been employed since
they relocated to their state of current residence in 2008. 
Applicant has a history of financial problems consisting of charged-off credit card
accounts. The SOR allegations consist of six delinquent accounts for a total of about
$138,000 (including late fees and interest). Applicant disclosed the delinquent accounts
when he completed his 2014 security clearance application,  he discussed them during7
his 2014 background investigation,  and he admitted them in his answer to the SOR.8
Five of the six accounts in the SOR are also established by credit reports from 2014 and
2015.  9
One of those six accounts, the $6,269 charged-off account in SOR ¶ 1.c, was
resolved in 2011, when the creditor cancelled the debt and issued Applicant a Form
1099-C for the phantom income associated with the debt ($5,188).  The five other10
charged-off accounts for about $132,000 are not paid, settled, in repayment, in dispute,
or otherwise resolved,  and those debts may or may not be unenforceable under the11
state’s six-year statute of limitations. His general plan or intent is that he is willing and
able to pay those debts, but he does not know who to pay, he does not know who
currently owns the debts, and no creditor has sued him for collection.  12
In addition to the indebtedness in the SOR, Applicant disclosed four other
delinquent accounts in his 2014 security clearance application.  Applicant resolved13
those four accounts by paying less than the full balance as follows: (1) he settled a
$19,880 credit card account for $1,998; (2) he settled a $5,481 credit card account for
$548; (3) he settled a $3,898 credit card account for $389; and (4) he settled a $8,706
credit card account for $3,080.  In total, he paid about $6,015 to settle nearly $38,00014
of credit card debt, which is about 16% on the dollar.

Applicant also has an installment repayment agreement with the IRS for back
taxes for tax years 2008 and 2009.  He estimated a beginning balance of $36,174, on15
which he is paying $500 monthly. The balance owed as of May 2015 was $24,256.16
Applicant traces his financial problems back to 2006 when he was working in the
automobile industry. Both Applicant and his wife lost their longtime jobs after their
employer filed for bankruptcy in 2006. They opted to receive separation packages
consisting of about 55% of the last annual salary, resulting in monthly payments of
$2,529 and $2,546 to Applicant and his spouse, respectively.  He stopped working17
there in about May 2006, and he began his job at the brewery about four months later in
August 2006. He successfully worked at the brewery for about 20 months until he
decided to leave because of a difficult work environment. He took a leave of absence in
January 2008 so he could undergo hip-replacement surgery. He formally left the
brewery in March 2008, although he had been in a no-pay status since the end of
December 2007. 
Applicant began his current employment in April 2008, but he was still dealing
with real estate in his state of former residence. In March 2008, Applicant put his home
up for sale at the price of $299,000, but due to a decline in the real estate market they
were unable to sell it until December 2008 for the price of $250,400.  To facilitate the18
sale and pay off the mortgage loan, and avoid a short sale, Applicant contributed about
$58,000. He paid the $58,000 through an assortment of credit cards, which is part of the
indebtedness in the SOR.  
Another piece of real estate is a family-owned duplex that he and his brother had
inherited.  His brother was not interested in the duplex, and so, Applicant bought his19
brother’s interest and obtained a mortgage loan of about $160,000 in June 2005.
Applicant’s son and his family occupy the lower level of the duplex. The upper level of
the duplex was rented out, but is now vacant. Applicant and his wife use it during family
visits. The status of the mortgage loan account is pays as agreed, it had a balance of
about $127,402 as of March 2015, and a scheduled payment of $1,155, but Applicant
actually pays $1,200 in an effort to reduce the principle.20

After selling the home in their state of former residence, Applicant and his wife
bought a home in their state of current residence in April 2009.  The purchase price21
was $221,000. The status of the mortgage loan account is pays as agreed, it had a
balance of about $197,382 as of March 2015, and a scheduled payment of $1,368, but
Applicant actually pays $1,400 in an effort to reduce the principle.22
Applicant sought professional assistance and advice from two attorneys in an
effort to deal with his financial problems. In 2010, he and his wife consulted a
bankruptcy attorney who advised them to continue paying the secured debts, stop
paying the unsecured debts, and pursue relief in bankruptcy court should a creditor sue
them for collection of a debt. In 2014, they consulted a second attorney who advised
them that the outstanding debts with the creditors in the SOR were unenforceable under
the state’s three-year statute of limitations. That advice was incorrect because the
applicable statute of limitations is six years.  23
Applicant made efforts in the past to resolve these debts, although his last
payment was made in about March 2010.  He sent letters in 2011, 2012, and 2013 to24
the creditors with offers of settlement, but received no replies.  25
Applicant and his wife went through a financial counseling session in April–May
2015.  His current gross annual income is about $160,000, which includes his salary26
and the pension payments he and his wife receive. He has a net monthly income of
about $9,823, which is about $117,876 annually.  As a result of the financial27
counseling, he is now using a written budget,  although he conceded “it’s a work in28
progress.”  He estimated a net monthly surplus of about $1,000.  His budgeting29 30
paperwork shows, among other things, a net worth of about $158,000, one credit card
account with a balance greater than $200, investment and retirement accounts worth
about $121,000, a checking account balance of $1,620, a savings account balance of

problems were apparent.32
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As33
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt34
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An35
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  36
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting37
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An38
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate39
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme40
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.41

financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In

The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.42
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it43
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant44
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 45
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  46
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly compromise
classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It encompasses
concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important qualities. A
person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or
negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
 AG ¶ 19(a).  47
 AG ¶ 19(c). 48
 AG ¶ 20(a)–(f).49

The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. Taken together, the evidence indicates inability or unwillingness
to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning47 48
of Guideline F. In reaching that conclusion, I looked closely at the evidence in an effort
to assess the facts and circumstances, which should be taken together and viewed as a
whole. Those facts and circumstances form part of a single or overall narrative of
financial mismanagement by misusing or abusing credit card accounts to the point
where Applicant was financially overextended as well as a good candidate for
bankruptcy. And those same facts and circumstances reflect a pattern of questionable
judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or irresponsibility.  
 In mitigation, I have considered six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and49
the following are most pertinent:
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the [person’s] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment; 
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or death, divorce, or
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control; and
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
I considered those four mitigating conditions, and none, individually or together,
is sufficient to mitigate the security concern stemming from Applicant’s ongoing and
largely unresolved financial problems. With that said, there are a number of extenuating
or mitigating circumstances to consider in Applicant’s case. First, he has numerous
favorable references, and he has a good if not outstanding employment record. Second,
Applicant and his wife experienced unexpected job loss in 2006, although that was
lessened by the severance package that included monthly pension payments. Third,
Applicant had periods of unemployment between jobs. Fourth, Applicant incurred the
expense of a major relocation in 2008 for his current job. Fifth, Applicant incurred the
 ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). 50
 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (citations and quotations omitted). 51
9
unexpected expense of $58,000 to sell his home in 2008 due to a declining real estate
market. And sixth, Applicant twice sought and followed professional guidance from
attorneys in an effort to address his financial problems. Seventh, Applicant wrote letters
and made settlement offers to resolve the credit card accounts during 2011–2013. And
eighth, Applicant fully disclosed his delinquent accounts on his 2014 security clearance
application and background investigation.     
Of course, the purpose of a security clearance case is not aimed at collecting
debts.  Rather, the purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and50
trustworthiness consistent with the guidelines in the Directive. In evaluating Guideline F
cases, the Appeal Board has established the following standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of a meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant
actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement
that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.51
Here, the evidence does not support a conclusion that Applicant has established
a plan and is taking steps to implement that plan sufficient to mitigate the concern. My
assessment of Applicant’s overall financial situation is that, unless a creditor brings a
collection lawsuit, he is simply waiting for his bad debts to age off credit reports or
become unenforceable under his state’s statute of limitations or both. Although that
approach is perfectly legal, it is not an approach that demonstrates good faith and
responsible conduct when seeking access to classified information. Morever, Applicant
has paid about $6,000 to settle $38,000 in credit card debt, he had another $6,000 of
credit card debt cancelled, and $132,000 in credit card debt is unresolved. In other
words, Applicant has paid about $6,000 (or about 3.5%) of the $176,000 in delinquent
credit card debt he incurred, which may fairly be described as a token if not meager
effort. Although I am persuaded that Applicant takes these matters seriously, he has not
displayed sufficient persistence and intensity in addressing his financial problems. 
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).52
10
Applicant’s history of financial problems creates doubt about his reliability,
trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching
this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable
evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due
consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I conclude that he did not52
meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.f: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified
information is denied.
