DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 16, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing 
security concerns under Guideline F. DOD CAF took that action under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant a security clearance. On April 8, 2015, Applicant answered the SOR and 
requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on June 15, 2015. The Defense 
 
2 
 
 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on July 7, 2015, and 
the hearing was convened as scheduled on July 22, 2015.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 
5. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibit (AE) A through G. All exhibits were 
admitted into evidence without objections. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 
July 28, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
working for that contractor since April 2013. He graduated from high school in 1995. He 
earned a bachelor’s degree in 2005 and a master’s degree in 2010. He has been 
married and divorced twice. He has two children, ages 5 and 15. He has held a security 
clearance for a number of years.1 
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant has 34 delinquent debts totaling about $160,000. 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant neither admitted nor denied the debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.m ($2,450), 1.s ($1,565), 1.x ($182), 1.aa ($21), and 1.ee ($748) but indicated that he 
was researching them. He denied the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.w ($379), 1.bb ($1,142), 1.cc 
($14,244), 1.ff ($1,176), and 1.hh ($1,124), and admitted the remaining allegations with 
comments. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. The debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.s, 1.w, and 1.x are not substantiated in the government exhibits. I find in favor of 
Applicant on SOR ¶¶ 1.s, 1.w, and 1.x. Entries in credit reports (GE 4, 5) substantiate 
the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.m, 1.aa, 1.bb, 1.cc, 1.ee, 1.ff, and 1.hh.2  
 
In an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview in July 2012, Applicant 
indicated that his financial problems started when he and his first wife separated in 
December 2007. He was laid off from a job in March 2008 and remained unemployed 
until June 2008. He and his first wife divorced in June 2008. He was also unemployed 
from May 2011 to September 2011, when he left a job because he “[d]esired better 
career growth opportunity.”3   
 
Applicant worked as a computer security system analyst for a major defense 
contractor from September 2011 to April 2013, earning about $78,000 annually. He left 
that defense contractor job because his wife lived and worked in a distant city. He 
thought it would be easy to obtain another job in that distant city, but was unable to 
obtain full-time employment there. He did not receive unemployment compensation 
during this period of unemployment. In May 2014, he returned to his former city and 
obtained a part-time job working for the city. In that part-time job, he works about 20

hours per week and earns about $1,000 per month. At the time of the hearing, he was 
still working in the part-time job. In October 2014, he obtained a full-time job working for 
a defense contractor, earning about $33,000 annually. His current employer is 
sponsoring him for a security clearance. In March 2015, he received an offer to work for 
another defense contractor with a starting salary of $78,000. This job offer is contingent 
on the prospective employer being awarded a certain contract and Applicant obtaining a 
Top Secret security clearance. In June 2015, he was granted a divorce from his second 
wife.4 
 
In March 2002, Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy and received a bankruptcy 
discharge in July 2002. This bankruptcy was not alleged in the SOR. He indicated that 
he had a lot of credit card debt at that time. He could not recall the amount of debt 
discharged in the bankruptcy.5 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a – child support arrearages of $40,942. Applicant testified that he was 
not aware that he was the father of his five-year child until she was about three years 
old. When paternity was established, a court assessed him child support arrearages for 
the first two years of the child’s life. Applicant’s part-time wages are garnished $111 
every two weeks for the child support payments and arrearages. He provided pay stubs 
confirming the garnishment. He believed about $25 of the biweekly garnishment went 
toward payment of the arrearages. He also testified that he was now residing with the 
five-year-old and her mother. He was not sure how the current custody situation would 
impact his child support obligations. Upon questioning, he testified that he had no 
documentation showing the he was relieved of the child support arrearages.6  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.l, 1.p, 1.q, 1.t, and 1.gg – student loans with past-due 
amounts totaling about $42,000 and outstanding balances totaling about $83,000. At 
the hearing, Applicant estimated that his student loans total about $98,000. He testified 
that he was looking into consolidating his student loans and was also trying to 
participate in a loan forgiveness program. He indicated that he has not made any 
payments on the student loans since graduating with his master’s degree, but had 
received deferments. No documentation was presented establishing the deferments. He 
further testified that the loans were not deferred at the time of the hearing, and he did

applicant’s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an 
applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular adjudicative 
guideline is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis under Directive Section 6.3

not know when the deferments ended. He also did not know the total amount he owed 
each month for these loans.7 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.m, 1.aa, and 1.ee – delinquent accounts totaling $3,219. These debts 
are two medical bills and a cell phone account. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant 
indicated that he was researching these debts. He testified that he did not have any 
additional information about these debts. They remain unresolved.8 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.n, 1.o, 1.r, 1.u, 1.v, 1.y, 1.z, and 1.dd – delinquent accounts totaling 
$13,143. Applicant testified that these accounts remain unresolved.9 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.bb, and 1.hh – delinquent accounts totaling $2,266. In his Answer to 
the SOR, Applicant indicated that these accounts were paid in full. He provided no 
documentation showing the accounts were paid. They remain unresolved.10 
 
SOR ¶ 1.cc – collection account totaling $14,244. In his Answer to the SOR, 
Applicant denied this debt and indicated that it was over ten years old. He stated he was 
going to research it and have it removed from his credit report. This was a loan for a 
truck that Applicant purchased for about $33,000 in late 2004 or early 2005. The truck 
was voluntarily repossessed after he was laid off from his job in 2008 and while he was 
going through a divorce. He provided no documentation showing this debt has been 
disputed or resolved.11 
 
SOR ¶ 1.ff – collection account for $1,176. Applicant provided documentation 
showing this account was paid in full in February 2011.12 
 
Applicant traveled with his wife to the Bahamas in 2005, Mexico in 2006, and 
Jamaica in 2010. Each of the first two trips cost about $1,500. He indicated that he did 
not pay for the Jamaica trip. At the time of the hearing, he had not yet filed his 2014 
federal and state income tax returns and had not requested filing extensions. He was 
“not really sure” why he had not filed those income tax returns. He further stated, “I just

hadn’t really think (sic) about it. I just wait, you know, wait until they respond to me and 
then I’ll file.” He was not sure whether he filed his 2012 and 2013 income tax returns.13 
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, in reaching a decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
                                                          
13 Tr. 63-69; GE 1. Applicant’s failure to file his 2014 income tax returns as required was not alleged 
in the SOR. See note 4, above, for the limited purposes that conduct not alleged in the SOR may be 
considered.

of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  
 
 The evidence established that Applicant accumulated delinquent debts that he 
was unable or unwilling to pay for an extended period. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply in 
this case. 
 
 Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
 
7 
 
 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Insufficient evidence was presented to establish that Applicant’s financial 
problems are under control or will be resolved within a reasonable period. His 
delinquent debts are recent and ongoing. He has experienced conditions beyond his 
control – such as being laid off from a job, lack of knowledge of a child’s paternity, and 
divorces – that have contributed to his financial problems; however, he failed to 
establish that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. Since obtaining his 
current job in April 2013, he has shown that he has only resolved one of the alleged 
debts (SOR ¶ 1.ff). His pay is being garnished for child support payments and 
arrearages. He failed to present a realistic plan for resolving the remaining debts, 
including the student loans. His delinquent debts continue to cast doubt on his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. No documentation was presented to 
show that he has a legitimate basis for disputing any of the debts. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), 
and 20(e) are not applicable. AG ¶¶ 20(b) and 20(d) partially apply. Financial security 
concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation.  
  
Whole-Person Concept 
In the adjudication process, an administrative judge must carefully weigh a 
number of variables known as the whole-person concept. Available information about 
the applicant as well as the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a) should be considered in reaching 
a determination.14 In this case, I gave due consideration to the information about 
                                                          
14 The adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows:  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
 
8 
 
 
Applicant in the record and concluded the favorable information, including the mitigating 
evidence, does not outweigh the security concerns at issue. Applicant failed to meet his 
burden of persuasion to mitigate the security concerns. Following the Egan decision and 
the “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard, doubts about granting 
Applicant a security clearance must be resolved in favor of national security. 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive 
are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   For Applicant  
 
Subparagraph 1.a:   For Applicant

Subparagraphs 1.w-1.x:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.y-1.ee:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.ff:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.gg-1.hh:  Against Applicant 
 
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Clearance is denied.
