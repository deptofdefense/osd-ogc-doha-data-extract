FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines F (Financial 
Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified information 
is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on October 10, 2013. On 
April 7, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines F and E.1 The DOD acted under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006. Applicant 
answered the SOR in an undated document. On July 24, 2015, he requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. (Hearing Exhibit (HX) I.) Department Counsel was ready 
to proceed on August 19, 2015, and the case was assigned to me on August 31, 2015. 
                                                          
1 The SOR also alleged security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), but the Guideline G 
allegations were withdrawn at the hearing. 
2 
 
On September 8, 2015, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for September 22, 2015. I convened 
the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 17 were admitted in 
evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A 
through C, which were admitted without objection. I kept the record open until October 
9, 2015, to enable him to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted 
AX D through I, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript 
(Tr.) on September 30, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.g, 3.b-3.f, and 3.h-
3.n. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d-1.f, 2.a, 3.a, and 3.g. His admissions in his answer 
and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 52-year-old aircraft mechanic employed by federal contractors 
since March 2007. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from February 1987 to 
February 2007, and retired as a petty officer first class (E-6). (AX C.) He received an 
associate’s degree from a technical college in February 2009. He has never held a 
security clearance. (Tr. 14.) 
 
 The SOR alleges seven delinquent debts. The evidence concerning these 
allegations is set out below. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a: Judgment for $192,000, filed in June 2009. Applicant denied this 
debt. It is reflected on his October 2013 credit bureau report (CBR), but not on his June 
2014 CBR (GX 3; GX 4 at 5.) The October 2013 CBR and court records submitted by 
Applicant reflect that the judgment was entered against a defendant who has the same 
first and last names as Applicant, but the listed defendant has a middle name. 
Applicant’s SCA and military records reflect that he has no middle name. (GX 1 at 5; AX 
C.) Applicant’s evidence refutes this allegation. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b: Delinquent second mortgage loan charged off for $76,320 in 
March 2008. This debt arose when Applicant was unable to make the payments on an 
investment property, because the tenants stopped paying rent. (Tr. 59.) He denied this 
debt, asserting that it was resolved. There were two mortgages on the property. The 
loan secured by the first mortgage was settled by a short sale for less than the full 
balance, and the first mortgage was released as satisfied. Applicant signed an 
unsecured promissory note for $20,000 to resolve the second mortgage and testified 
that he paid it, but he submitted no documentary evidence of payment. The debt is not 
resolved. (GX 3 at 3; GX 4 at 4; AX A; AX B; Tr. 62-67.)  
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d: Credit card account charged off for $15,615 in August 
2010; placed for collection for $13,589 in August 2013. Applicant admitted these 
debts. The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c was purchased by the lender alleged in SOR ¶ 
1.d. Applicant entered into a payment agreement in September 2015, providing for $650 
3 
 
payments to be made by automatic debit beginning on September 25, 2015. (GX 4 at 5; 
AX D; AX E; AX F; Tr. 67-68.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e: Medical debt for $36, placed for collection in December 2009. 
Applicant denied this debt, asserting that it was resolved. He provided a confirmation 
number but no documentation of payment. (Answer to SOR.) It is reflected as unpaid in 
his June 2014 CBR. (GX 3 at 1; GX 4 at 5.) It is not resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f: Debt for $107 to digital video disk (DVD) club, placed for 
collection in May 2013. Applicant denied this debt, claiming that he had no information 
about this debt. It is reflected on his October 2013 CBR but not in his June 2014 CBR. 
(GX 3; GX 4 at 15.) At the hearing, he testified that he tried to resolve the debt, but the 
original creditor could not find a record of the debt without an account number, which he 
did not have. (Tr. 71.) In his post-hearing submission, Applicant stated that he has been 
unable to locate the collection agency. (AX D.)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g: Debt to investment club, placed for collection for $3,748 in 
October 2013. Applicant admitted this debt, which is reflected in his October 2013 
CBR. (GX 4 at 14.). In his answer, Applicant stated that he had a payment plan in 
progress. In May, June, and July 2015, Applicant made three payments of $1,049 on 
this debt. (AX E; AX G.) At the hearing and in his post-hearing submission, he stated 
that the debt is paid in full. (Tr. 72-73; AX D.) It is not reflected in his June 2014 CBR. 
(GX 3.) 
 
 The SOR alleges an alcohol-related incident (SOR ¶ 2.a) and 14 traffic incidents 
(SOR ¶ 3.a-3.n). Court records reflect the following incidents, listed in chronological 
order:

 Applicant was charged with misdemeanors for the incidents in SOR ¶¶ 3.a, 3h, 
and 3.j. He was charged with infractions for all the other incidents. 
 
 At the hearing, I granted Department Counsel’s motion to withdraw the Guideline 
G allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2 and 2.a., withdraw SOR ¶ 3.g, and add SOR ¶ 3.o, alleging 
that Applicant received a summons for speeding and having an open container on 
September 27, 2012. (Tr. 20-21, 104.)   
 
 Applicant married in January 2002. He has two children, ages 17 and 11, and 
two stepchildren, ages 26 and 22. The 17-year-old child was from a previous marriage 
and lives with her mother. Applicant pays child support of $295 per month. (Tr. 51.) 
 
When Applicant first began working for a defense contractor, his annual pay was 
about $45,000. (Tr. 52.) His current annual pay is about $55,000, and his military retired 
pay is about $14,400 per year. (Tr. 54.) His wife’s annual pay is about $70,000. (Tr. 84.) 
He testified that the monthly family income and expenses are about equal. However, he 
is refinancing his home mortgage loan, which will reduce his monthly payments by 
about $600. (Tr. 87.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
5 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
  
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly 
compromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns 
about an individual’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting 
classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
6 
 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified 
information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing 
establish that the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.a was entered against someone other than 
Applicant. The evidence also shows that the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. is also alleged 
in SOR ¶ 1.d. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same 
guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See 
ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). 
Thus, I will resolve the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d in Applicant’s favor. 
 
 The evidence establishes the delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.e-
1.g and two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts”) and AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial 
obligations”). The following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially 
applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, 
and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is not established. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b arose due to a falling real 
estate market and failure of tenants to pay the rent. However, Applicant did not submit 
evidence that he acted responsibly. He claimed to have paid the $20,000 to satisfy the 
debt, but he submitted no evidence of payment. The medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.e may 
7 
 
have been due to conditions beyond his control, but he has provided no evidence of 
payment. He provided no evidence of the circumstances surrounding the debt to the 
investment club alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence that he has 
sought or received financial counseling, and his financial problems are not under 
control. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is not established. Good faith means acting in a way that shows 
reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case 
No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A security clearance 
adjudication is an evaluation of an individual’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. 
It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) 
Thus, security concerns raised by delinquent debts are not mitigated by payment of 
debts motivated primarily by the pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. 
Applicant did not attempt to contact the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.f or initiate his payment 
plans for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, and 1.g until after he received the SOR and 
realized that his delinquent debts were an impediment to obtaining a security clearance.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(e) is established for the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.a. Applicant disputed the 
debt and submitted documentary evidence that the judgment was entered against 
another defendant with a similar name. 
 
Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption 
 
 I granted Department Counsel’s motion to withdraw the allegations under this 
guideline. The conduct originally alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a is now alleged under Guideline E 
in SOR ¶¶ 3.h and 3.o and is discussed below. 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 15: “Conduct involving 
questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules 
and regulations can raise questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and 
ability to protect classified information. . . .” Applicant was found not guilty of the 
infraction alleged in SOR ¶ 3.a. However, his admissions and the documentary 
evidence submitted at the hearing establish SOR ¶¶ 3.b-3.f and 3.h-3.o. Although I 
granted Department Counsel’s motion to add SOR ¶ 3.o, further review of the evidence 
has revealed that SOR ¶¶ 3.h and 3.o allege the same conduct. Thus, I will resolve 
SOR ¶ 3.o in Applicant’s favor.  
 Applicant’s driving record establishes the following disqualifying conditions under 
this guideline:  
AG ¶ 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue 
areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other 
8 
 
single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a 
whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not 
properly safeguard protected information; 
AG ¶ 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered 
under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an 
adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available 
information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable 
judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that 
the person may not properly safeguard protected information. This 
includes but is not limited to consideration of . . . a pattern of dishonesty or 
rule violations; and  
AG ¶ 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's 
conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or 
duress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the 
person's personal, professional, or community standing.  
 The following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: 
 
AG ¶ 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the 
behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained 
counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to 
alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused 
untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such 
behavior is unlikely to recur; and 
 
AG ¶ 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. 
 
 AG ¶ 17(c) is not established. Although all the incidents alleged under this 
Guideline were either misdemeanors or infractions, they are numerous and did not 
occur under unique circumstances. Applicant’s most recent infraction occurred shortly 
before the hearing. His repeated violations raise concerns about his ability to follow 
rules and regulations. 
 
 AG ¶ 17(d) is not established. Applicant has acknowledged his behavior, but he 
has not taken steps to change it.  
 
9 
 
 AG ¶ 17(e) is established. Applicant has been candid and forthright about his 
traffic incidents. He voluntarily disclosed his most recent incident at the hearing. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process 
factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person 
analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but 
some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant has worked in support of national defense, in and out of uniform, for 
more than 28 years. He was candid and sincere at the hearing. Although Applicant 
portrayed himself at the hearing as living paycheck to paycheck, his family’s gross 
income is almost $140,000 per year, suggesting that his delinquent debts were due to 
inattention rather than lack of income. His payment agreement for the debt alleged in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d is too recent to reflect a track record of compliance with it. His 
neglect of his financial obligations and his long record of traffic incidents raise doubts 
about his reliability, trustworthiness and judgment.  
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and 
E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude 
Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial delinquencies 
and personal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to 
classified information.

Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:     For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.b-1.c:    Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.d:     For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.e-1.g:    Against Applicant 
 
 Paragraph 2, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): WITHDRAWN 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a:     Withdrawn 
 
 Paragraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 3.a:     For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 3.b-3.f:    Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 3.g:     Withdrawn 
 
  Subparagraphs 3.h-3.n:    Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 3.o:     For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information 
is denied.
