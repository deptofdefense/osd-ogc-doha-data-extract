GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 30, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On June 5, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial

Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. In a statement, dated July 30, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations,2 
and by separate e-mail, dated August 4, 2014, he elected to have his case decided on 
the written record in lieu of a hearing.3 A complete copy of the Government’s file of 
relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on May 11, 2015, and he was 
afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant 
received the FORM on June 1, 2015. A response was due by July 1, 2015. On an 
unspecified date before that due-date, Applicant submitted his Response to the FORM, 
including documents. Department Counsel had no objections to the documents 
submitted, and I marked them as Applicant Items (AI) A through AI J. The case was 
assigned to me on August 12, 2015.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.b. through 1.i., 1.k through 1.q., 
and 1.s.). He denied the remaining allegations. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated 
herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of 
fact: 
 
Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as a contract specialist with his current employer since November 2012,4 as well 
as the president and chief of operations for his own consulting firm since April 2011.5 He 
was unemployed from September 2007 until July 2008, following his discharge from 
military service;6 from May 2010 until August 2010, after being subjected to racial 
discrimination (for which he has a pending complaint filed with the U.S. Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission) and fired;7 and again from September 2011 until

November 2012, after being laid off as part of a company downsizing.8 He received a 
bachelor’s degree in 1998.9 Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in April 1988, and he 
served in the active reserve until October 1989, and on active duty from October 1989 
until August 1992. He was commissioned in August 1992. He returned to active duty in 
an officer status in August 1998 and remained on active duty until August 2007.10 He 
was deployed to Bosnia for an unspecified period during 2000-01.11 Applicant was 
granted a top secret security clearance while serving with the U.S. Army.12 He was 
married in 1998, and divorced in 2001.13 He has four children, born in 1992, 1998, 2003, 
and 2011.14 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2000-01. While 
he was deployed, without his knowledge, Applicant’s wife left their marriage and 
stopped paying the family bills. Accounts became delinquent. When he returned from 
his deployment, Applicant found out about his delinquent accounts and began 
addressing them. He managed to keep them current until he was discharged, but the 
ensuing period of unemployment as well as subsequent periods of unemployment 
destabilized his efforts.15 In addition, in 2011, as a result of an arbitration hearing at the 
state child support enforcement office, Applicant was ordered to pay monthly child 
support in the amount of $350. If it is determined that Applicant is not the biological 
father of the child, the child’s mother has agreed to petition the agency to terminate the 
order.16  
 
During his lengthy periods of unemployment, Applicant was forced to prioritize 
his accounts. He paid some bills off when he could, but generally he had to focus on 
child support (for both current and arrearage), housing, and searching for, or getting to, 
work. Since his credit reports contained a substantial number of negative accounts, the 
task seemed overwhelming to him. Applicant subsequently adjusted his strategy and 
sought the assistance of a credit counselor. He met with his credit counselors regularly, 
received monthly updated reports, prepared monthly expenditure reports, and 
monitored his accounts. He keeps a calendar to alert him as to when his bills are due to

make sure his bills are paid on time. He also engaged the services of an attorney to 
assist him in resolving certain financial issues.17 His credit counselors also monitor 
Applicant’s finances to guard against false reporting of negative information on his credit 
reports.18  
The SOR identified 19 purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, totaling 
approximately $33,710, which had been placed for collection, charged off, or went to 
judgment. Those debts and their respective current status, according to a March 2013 
Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax credit report;19 a May 2014 Equifax credit 
report;20 and an October 2014 Equifax credit report;21 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR; 
his Response to the FORM; and various submissions by him, are described as follows: 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b. through 1.i., and 1.k., 1.l., and 1.q.): This is a variety of different 
accounts that were placed for collection or charged off in varying amounts: a power 
utility account for $222 (SOR ¶ 1.b.);22 a gas utility account for $747 (SOR ¶ 1.c.);23 an

Applicant had purchased the 2005 vehicle while he was on active duty, but his lengthy 
unemployment situation made it difficult for him to maintain his monthly payments. He 
voluntarily relinquished the vehicle to the lender in 2008. The lender apparently sold the 
vehicle for nearly $6,000, but never informed Applicant that there was a deficiency of 
approximately $23,000. Applicant indicated he was willing to resolve the debt if it is 
valid, and he requested validation and verification of the debt, but the lender failed to 
sufficiently respond.43 He subsequently disputed the debt with the credit reporting 
agencies, and because the lender could not support the claim, the debt was removed 
from Applicant’s June 2015 Experian credit report.44 The account has been resolved. 
Applicant’s net monthly income fluctuates between $4,000 and $6,000. His 
normal monthly expenses, including $150 for credit monitoring services, are $2,535, 
leaving him approximately $1,500 available for discretionary savings or spending. While 
he has five credit cards, he does not carry over any balances.45 He has no other 
delinquent accounts. 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”46 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”47

When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”48 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.49  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”50 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”51 Thus, nothing 
                                                          
48
 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems initially arose in about 2000-01 during 
a military deployment and continued for several years thereafter. He was unable to 
continue making his routine monthly payments and some accounts became delinquent, 
were placed for collection, charged off, or went to judgment. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) 
apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
 
9 
                                      
 
resolve debts.”52 Under AG ¶ 20(e) it is potentially mitigating if “the individual has a 
reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the 
problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) all apply. Applicant’s financial 
problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend 
beyond his means. Instead, those financial problems were initially caused by his wife 
when she decided to abandon her bill-paying responsibilities as well as the marriage 
while Applicant was on a military deployment. He eventually managed to repair his 
accounts, but his continuing efforts were essentially thwarted by subsequent events that 
were largely beyond his control. Upon his discharge from the U.S. Army, Applicant was 
unemployed from September 2007 until July 2008. That status resumed in May 2010 
and remained unchanged until August 2010. He was again unemployed from 
September 2011 until November 2012. Applicant did not ignore his accounts as some of 
them spiraled into delinquency status. Instead, he was forced to prioritize his accounts. 
He paid some bills off when he could, but generally he had to focus on a few essential 
obligations, including child support, housing, and potential work-related expenses. The 
task seemed overwhelming to him. 
 
Applicant sought the assistance of a credit counselor. He met regularly with his 
credit counselors, received monthly updated reports, prepared monthly expenditure 
reports, and monitored his accounts. He established a calendar to alert him as to when 
his bills are due to make sure his bills are paid on time. He also obtained the services of 
an attorney to assist him in resolving certain financial issues.  
While the SOR identified 19 purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, three of 
those accounts were actually the same account in various phases. Some accounts 
identified were not Applicant’s, and when he disputed them, those accounts were 
removed from his credit reports. The alleged delinquent status of some accounts was 
simply in error. As they had been previously resolved, the listings were corrected in his 
credit report. When faced with insufficient funds to maintain or resolve some accounts, 
he maintained his prioritizing efforts. Upon becoming employed in November 2012, 
Applicant returned to his good-faith efforts of resolving his remaining delinquent

 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating 
condition].

accounts. While it took him approximately one and one-half years to do so, Applicant’s 
has managed to pay off or otherwise resolve all of the accounts listed in the SOR.53  
Applicant has no other more recent delinquent debts, and his financial situation is 
stable and steadily improving. He is able to meet all of his monthly financial obligations. 
Applicant’s financial problems appear to be under control, largely attributed to his 
continuing good-faith efforts to pay his creditors. Applicant’s actions under the 
circumstances confronting him, do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.54 
There is a substantial risk when one accepts, at face value, the contents of a 
credit report without obtaining original source documentation to verify entries. Credit 
bureaus collect information from a variety of sources, including public records and 
“other sources,” and it is these other unidentified sources that are the cause for 
concern. Likewise, when accounts are transferred, reassigned, sold, or merely churned, 
an individual’s credit history can look worse than it really is. In this particular instance, 
the credit report referred to various creditors for the same delinquent accounts. Because 
of abbreviated names and acronyms, as well as incomplete account numbers, many of 
those entries are garbled and redundant, and have inflated the financial concerns. 
Furthermore, the absence of the identity of original creditors, especially those simply 
listed as “medical creditor”  in the credit reports and the SOR makes the analysis that 
much more difficult. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.55   
     
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant’s 
financial status deteriorated to the point where he was no longer capable of maintaining 
his normal monthly payments. Various accounts became delinquent or were charged 
off.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
There is no evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling 
protected information, substance abuse, or criminal conduct. Applicant’s financial 
problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend 
beyond his means. Rather, Applicant’s problems were largely beyond his control. His 
wife’s actions while he was deployed, the eventual divorce, the child support order, 
being laid off or fired, and repeated periods of unemployment, were events over which 
Applicant had little control. Applicant did not ignore his accounts as some of them 
spiraled into delinquency status. Instead, he was forced to prioritize his accounts. He 
paid some bills off when he could, but generally he had to focus on a few essential 
obligations. He sought the assistance of a credit counselor and an attorney. The results 
were successful, and Applicant has resolved all of the accounts listed in the SOR as 
well as other non-SOR accounts. He now has approximately $1,500 available each 
month for discretionary savings or spending. While he has five credit cards, he does not 
carry any balances. He has no other delinquent accounts. Applicant’s financial problems 
appear to be under control. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:56 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available,

 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. That effort commenced before the SOR was issued. His actions, 
under the circumstances confronting him, do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment. The entire situation occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.  
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. 
See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.s.:  For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
