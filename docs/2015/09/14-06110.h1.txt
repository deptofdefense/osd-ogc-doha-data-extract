LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 26, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on April 25, 2015, and elected to have the case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The Government’s written case was 
submitted on July 1, 2015. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was 
provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit 
material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the 
 
2 
 
FORM on July 21, 2015. He responded with documents that I have marked Applicant’s 
Exhibit (AE) A through D. The case was assigned to me on August 25, 2015. The 
Government exhibits included in the FORM and AE A through D are admitted without 
objection.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his current employer since September 2012. He served in the U.S. military from 1988 
until he was honorably discharged in 1991. He held a security clearance in the past. It is 
unclear whether he currently holds a clearance. He has a bachelor’s degree that was 
awarded in 2000 and two master’s degrees that were awarded in 2001 and 2002. He is 
married with three children, ages 21, 19, and 18.1   
 
Applicant has a history of financial problems. He filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
petition in 1998. It is unclear whether his debts were discharged. The reason for the 
bankruptcy is also unclear. Applicant was unemployed from about December 2004 to 
May 2005.2 
 
Applicant bought a house to be used as his primary residence in about 2003. It 
was financed with a first mortgage loan of $207,000. He refinanced the mortgage in 
2005 for $310,500. He used $100,000 he received from the new loan to perform home 
improvements, including a new kitchen.3   
 
Applicant bought another house in 2006 to be used as his primary residence. He 
kept the first house as a rental property. The new house was financed with a first 
mortgage loan of $404,799 and a second mortgage loan of $101,200. He refinanced the 
second mortgage with a home equity line of credit (HELOC) in 2007 for $135,538. He 
also obtained a third mortgage loan in 2007 for $38,000. He used $22,009 he received 
from the HELOC and the $38,000 from the third mortgage loan to improve the home, 
including building a swimming pool.4   
 
Applicant’s mother developed cancer in 2009. He incurred expenses in moving 
her cross country to live with him and in caring for her. The renters of Applicant’s first 
house moved out in 2011. Applicant’s new renters did not pay the rent. They moved out 
in late 2011 and left the house in shambles. Applicant became unemployed in 
November 2011. He obtained his current job in September 2012, but he had to relocate 
cross country, at a substantially lower salary. His wife lost her job when they moved and 
did not find steady employment in her field until August 2014.5

 Applicant stopped paying the mortgage loans on his two properties. His rental 
property was lost to foreclosure in March 2012. The holder of the foreclosed mortgage 
loan issued an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form 1099-A (Acquisition or 
Abandonment of Secured Property) for tax year 2012. The form indicated that the 
lender acquired the property in March 2012. The balance of the principal on the 
mortgage loan at that time was listed as $297,513, and the fair market value of the 
property was listed as $155,000.6  
 
 Applicant stated that he resolved the second house (residence) debts through a 
short sale. He stated the house sold for $385,343. He did not provide any supporting 
documentation to establish the house was actually short sold or that the secondary 
lienholders agreed to a short sale.7   
 
 The SOR alleges the delinquent HELOC on the residence (SOR ¶ 1.a - 
$187,516)8 and the unpaid third mortgage loan on the residence (SOR ¶ 1.c - $37,687). 
The primary mortgage loans on the two properties were not alleged. Applicant stated 
that he has “no plans to repay remaining balances from originally collateralized property 
that has been short sold and has since been charged off.” The HELOC and the third 
mortgage loan are both listed on the October 2014 credit report with the balances 
alleged in the SOR. The second mortgage loan is listed as charged off.9 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a delinquent bank credit card debt of $21,610. SOR ¶ 1.d 
alleges a delinquent debt of $19,456 owed to the collection company that acquired the 
debt. Applicant listed the debt on his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 
86), which he submitted in November 2012. He listed the balance as $22,956 and that 
he was on a $175 per month repayment plan. The November 2012 credit report listed 
the debt to the bank as a charged-off account that was $4,025 past due with a balance 
of $21,610. The October 2014 credit report listed the debt to the collection company 
with a balance of $19,456. Applicant noted in his response to the FORM that the 
balance was being repaid monthly. He submitted no supporting documentation.10 
 
 Applicant admitted owing the delinquent credit union debt of $7,306 that was 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. it is a credit card debt to the credit union that held the HELOC on 
his residence. The credit union reported the debt as charged off. Applicant did not state 
that he intends to pay the debt, possibly because it was charged off. He indicated that 
the debt will remain on his credit report until 2019.11

 Applicant had debts that were not alleged in the SOR that became delinquent.12 
He had a timeshare property that he bought in 2007 for about $20,000. It had a balance 
of more than $20,000 when it was lost to foreclosure. There is no indication of a 
deficiency balance. He had three car loans that were initiated in 2008. The credit report 
lists the high credit on the loans as $34,383; $68,788; and $72,604. The total monthly 
payments on the three loans were about $2,750. The cars were repossessed. The 
credit report does not list a balance on the accounts, and it reports the debts as “paid 
charge off” and/or “account paid for less than full balance.” Applicant stated that he 
settled the deficiency balances on the car loans for $6,000; $7,000; and $13,000.13 
 
 The October 2014 credit report lists that Applicant was current on three car loans 
with monthly payments of $355, $412, and $498, and balances of $13,839; $14,689; 
and $19,382. The 2012 credit report lists deferred student loans with balances of 
$4,596; $6,901; and $37,711. The 2014 credit report lists two of the loans as current 
and no longer deferred, with balances of $7,104 and $39,443. There is no evidence of 
financial counseling. Applicant wrote in his response to the SOR: “Presently, admitted 
items are being dealt with in a manner consistent with my current financial situations 
and obligations, within a timetable defined by my family needs and priorities; and with all 
options still being explored, including Bankruptcy.” Additional information about 
Applicant’s current financial situation is unavailable because Applicant chose to forego a 
hearing.14 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
                                                          
12 Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes, but may be 
considered in assessing Applicant’s overall financial status, in the application of mitigating conditions, and 
when conducting the whole-person analysis.  
 
13 Items 2-5.  
 
14 Items 1, 4, 5.

The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 
6 
 
 Applicant had delinquent debts that he was unable or unwilling to pay. The 
evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b allege the same debt. SOR ¶ 1.f alleges an original credit 
card debt, and SOR ¶ 1.d alleges the same debt to the collection company that 
acquired the debt. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same 
guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant’s favor. See 
ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3. SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.f are 
concluded for Applicant. 
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in 1998. The reason for the 
bankruptcy is unclear. The 1998 bankruptcy does not generate current security 
concerns. SOR ¶ 1.g is concluded for Applicant. 
 
Applicant was unemployed from about December 2004 to May 2005. He cared 
for his mother who had cancer. He had tenants who did not pay the rent and moved out, 
leaving the house in shambles. He was unemployed from November 2011 to 
September 2012. He had to relocate his family cross country for his current job, which 
paid substantially less than his previous job. His wife lost her job when they moved and 
did not find steady employment in her field until August 2014.  
 
Applicant’s finances were clearly adversely affected by events that were beyond 
his control. However, some of his financial decisions are troubling. He was not that far 
removed from his 1998 bankruptcy and 2005 unemployment when he bought a second 
house without selling the first house. He took out second and third mortgage loans on 
the second house in order to build a swimming pool. He bought a $20,000 timeshare. 
He had three cars financed through loans that the credit reported listed the high credit 
 
7 
 
on the loans as totaling more than $175,000, with total monthly payments totaling about 
$2,750. Because Applicant chose to forego a hearing, questions about his decision 
making went unanswered. 
 
  Applicant lost two houses and a timeshare to foreclosure or a short sale and 
three cars to repossession. He settled the deficiency balances for the three car loans, 
and the primary mortgages on the two houses appear to be resolved. Applicant did not 
submit documentary evidence that he is paying the delinquent credit card debt alleged 
in SOR ¶ 1.d, but the credit reports indicate the balance on the debt is going down. I 
accept his assertion that he is making payments on the debt. That allegation is 
mitigated. He stated that he does not intend to pay the HELOC and the third mortgage 
loan and there is no indication that he has made any effort to pay the $7,306 credit card 
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e, possibly because it was charged off.15 Applicant currently 
has three car loans, albeit much smaller loans than on the three cars that were 
repossessed. He also has about $46,000 in student loans that are no longer in 
deferment. 
 
  It is Applicant’s burden to mitigate any concerns raised by his finances. He has 
not done so. There is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant’s financial 
problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted 
responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his 
debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) 
are not applicable to the unresolved debts. AG ¶ 20(b) is partially applicable. I find that 
financial considerations concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
                                                          
15 The Appeal Board has noted that “a creditor’s choice to charge off a debt for accounting purposes does 
not affect the debtor’s obligation to the creditor.” See ISCR Case No. 08-11983 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 28, 
2011) (citing ISCR Case No. 09-01175 at 2 (App. Bd. May 11, 2010)). 
 
8 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in this whole-person analysis.  
 
I considered Applicant’s honorable military service, and the factors that led to his 
financial problems. However, he has unresolved financial problems with unanswered 
questions as to how he plans to remedy those problems.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not 
mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.c-1.e:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.f-1.g:   For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
