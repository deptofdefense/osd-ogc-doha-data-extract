HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 12 delinquent or collection 
accounts and one judgment totaling $19,328. He paid one $188 SOR debt in 2014, and 
he has not made any payments to SOR creditors in 2015. He disputed one debt for 
$210. He failed to provide sufficient documentation of his progress in resolving his 
financial problems. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 21, 2011, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security clearance application (SF 86). 
(GE 1) On July 28, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006.    
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(HE 2) The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to find that it is clearly 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information 
and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, revoked, or denied. (HE 2) 
 
On April 16, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing. (HE 3) On June 27, 2015, Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On 
July 23, 2015, Applicant’s case was assigned to me. On August 5, 2015, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing setting the hearing 
for August 20, 2015. Applicant waived his right to 15 days of notice of the date, time, 
and location of his hearing. (Tr. 14-15) Department Counsel offered four exhibits into 
evidence, and Application offered one exhibit into evidence. (Tr. 17-19, GE 1-4; AE A) 
There were no objections and all exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 18-20; GE 1-
4; AE A) On August 28, 2015, DOHA received the transcript of the hearing.    
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted SOR debts ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 
1.i.2 He denied the other SOR debts, and he provided extenuating and mitigating 
information as part of his SOR response. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 34-year-old logistics analyst, who has worked for a large defense 
contractor for the previous five years, except the period from 2011 to 2013, when he 
worked for another employer. (Tr. 6-7, 21-22, 29, 32-35) In 1999, he graduated from 
high school. (Tr. 6) He has never been married, and he does not have any children. (Tr. 
7-8) He is the guardian of his 30-year-old sister and 7-year-old nephew. (Tr. 8) He has 
never served in the military. (Tr. 6) There is no evidence of security violations, abuse of 
alcohol, or use of illegal drugs. (GE 1; GE 2) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
In 2006 or 2007, Applicant was admitted as a hospital inpatient for assessment of 
his severe back pain, and while in the hospital, he had heart problems. (Tr. 23-24, 27; 
Ex. 2) From September 2007 to April 2009, he was self-employed in construction and 
photography. (Tr. 28) In April 2009, he began employment with his current employer, 
and his starting annual salary was $50,000. (Tr. 29-30) By 2010, his annual salary was 
increased to $60,000. (Tr. 31) In 2012, he was unemployed for six months from his 
primary employment, and he stayed busy with part-time employment. (Tr. 31-32, 36) His 
salary from the government contractor from 2014 to 2015 has been $59,000 annually. 
(Tr. 34, 71) For the past five years, he has supported his sister, who has medical 
problems, and his nephew. (Tr. 36, 39) His sister receives social security disability 
                                            
1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.  
 
2The source for the information in this paragraph is Applicant’s SOR response. (HE 3)   
 
3 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
payments. (Tr. 39) He also provided financial support to his mother, who had medical 
problems until she passed away. (Tr. 40, 65)  
 
On February 21, 2011, Applicant disclosed the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.e through 
1.h, and 1.l on his SF 86. (Tr. 51; GE 1) During his March 30, 2011 Office of Personnel 
Management personal subject interview (OPM PSI), Applicant discussed the SOR 
debts, and he told the OPM investigator that he “has contacted all creditors to set up a 
payment plan now that he has a stable job and income. [Applicant] is awaiting 
paperwork from each creditor so that he can get all delinquent bills caught up and paid.” 
(GE 2, OPM PSI at 3) 
 
In 2012, a credit union obtained a judgment against Applicant for $4,557. (SOR ¶ 
1.a) Applicant said he purchased something like lapse insurance, which would pay for 
the lien on the vehicle if he was ill or unemployed. (Tr. 52-53) His vehicle was 
repossessed in 2005 or 2006. (Tr. 54-56) Ultimately, he decided he would pay other 
debts and bills and not to pay this debt until he had more funds available. (Tr. 53) He 
has not responded to correspondence received from the creditor. (Tr. 56-57) 
 
Applicant accepted responsibility for the $1,840 debt in SOR ¶ 1.b, which 
resulted when he broke a lease for an apartment in 2011 or 2012. (Tr. 42-44, 48) He 
most recently communicated with the creditor in 2012, when the creditor asked for 
payment in full. (Tr. 43) He did not make any payments to the creditor after he broke the 
lease.  
 
Applicant’s $188 utility debt in SOR ¶ 1.c related to the apartment lease he broke 
in 2011 or 2012. Applicant said he paid his $188 utility debt in 2014; however, he did not 
have any documentation showing payment with him at his hearing. (Tr. 45-47) He has 
service from the utility, and the utility debt is mitigated. (Tr. 47) 
 
Applicant disputed his responsibility for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d for $210 because 
he believed the debt was his mother’s responsibility. (Tr. 57-58; HE 3) In 2014, he 
contacted the creditor and disputed the debt, and he noted that it was not on his April 
13, 2015 credit report. (Tr. 58; AE A)  
 
The SOR includes seven medical debts totaling $5,069 as follows: ¶ 1.e for 
$422; ¶ 1.f for $855; ¶ 1.g for $157; ¶ 1.h for $288; ¶ 1.i for $28; ¶ 1.j for $35; ¶ 1.k for 
$1,318, and ¶ 1.m for $1,966. In 2007, Applicant was admitted to the hospital for five 
days and medical bills totaling about $30,000 were generated during the treatment of 
his heart and back. (Tr. 59-60) He did not have medical insurance. (Tr. 60) When he 
was in the hospital, he completed documentation asking for relief from the debt. (Tr. 60-
61) Two of the seven debts appear on his April 13, 2015 credit report: SOR ¶ 1.e for 
$422 (generated in 2009) and SOR ¶ 1.j for $35 (generated in 2009). (AE A)3 He said 
he might have made some payments to some of the creditors. (Tr. 62-63) 
                                            
3The April 13, 2015 credit report Applicant provided was from one of the three major credit 
reporting companies (AE A). He did not provide copies of the reports from the other two major credit 
reporting companies, and those other two reports may list additional delinquent debts.

Applicant could not remember when he contacted the creditor of the credit card 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.l for $7,464. (Tr. 64-65) He did not pay the creditor or collection 
company, and he believed it dropped off of his credit report due to the passage of time. 
(Tr. 67) 
 
In sum, Applicant said the only SOR debt with a record of making any payments 
was his $188 utility debt in SOR ¶ 1.c, which he paid in 2014. (Tr. 68-69) He 
successfully disputed the debt for $210 in SOR ¶ 1.d. Nothing was paid to any of the 
SOR creditors in 2015. (Tr. 69) The April 13, 2015 credit report Applicant presented 
included a non-SOR $522 credit card debt that was charged off. (AE A at 4) Applicant 
has not had financial counseling. (Tr. 79) He has generated a budget; he did not provide 
a copy of his budget for the record; and he occasionally has some funds left over at the 
end of the month. He often invests his excess funds in equipment for his photography 
and computer business, or he pays expenses for his sister and nephew. (Tr. 80) 
           
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865. 
    
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this 
decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply.

(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his SF 
86, OPM PSI, credit reports, SOR response, and hearing record. Applicant’s SOR 
alleges 12 delinquent or collection accounts and one judgment totaling $19,328. The 
Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring 
additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;4 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
                                            
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
 Applicant is credited with paying the $188 utility debt in SOR ¶ 1.c, which he paid 
in 2014. SOR ¶ 1.c is mitigated. He said the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d for $210 was his 
mother’s debt. He communicated with the SOR ¶ 1.d creditor, and the debt does not 
appear on his April 13, 2015 credit report. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.d is mitigated.   
 
 Applicant’s conduct in resolving his delinquent debt does not establish full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all of his SOR debts. He did not provide 
sufficient information about his finances to establish his inability to make greater 
progress paying his creditors. He described his medical problems in 2007, and several 
periods where he was unemployed or underemployed. He is caring for his sister and 
nephew. However, he did not provide sufficient evidence about how these 
circumstances largely beyond his control caused his financial problems, and he did not 
provide proof that he acted responsibly under the circumstances.   
 
 Applicant did not provide documentation showing his income and expenses, and 
he did not provide a budget. He presented insufficient evidence about what he has done 
since becoming employed with his current employer to pay his SOR debts or his other 
debts. He did not provide any of the following documentation relating to the SOR 
creditors: (1) proof of payments, such as checking account statements, photocopies of 
checks, or a letter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the 
creditor; (2) correspondence to or from any creditors to establish maintenance of 
contact with creditors;5 (3) a credible debt dispute indicating he did not believe he was 
responsible for the debt and why he held such a belief; (4) attempts to negotiate 
payment plans, such as settlement offers or agreements to show that he was attempting 
                                            
5“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

to resolve these SOR debts; (5) evidence of financial counseling; or (6) other evidence 
of progress or resolution of his SOR debts. 
 
  Applicant’s failure to prove that he has made more substantial steps to resolve 
his debts shows a lack of judgment and responsibility that weighs against approval of 
his security clearance. There is insufficient evidence that he was unable to make 
greater progress resolving his delinquent debts, or that his financial problems are being 
resolved, are under control, and will not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, 
he failed to establish that financial consideration concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance. Applicant 
is a 34-year-old logistics analyst, who has worked for a large defense contractor for the 
previous five years, except the period from 2011 to 2013, when he worked for another 
employer. He is the guardian of his sister and nephew. On February 21, 2011, Applicant 
disclosed six debts on his SF 86. During his March 30, 2011 OPM PSI, Applicant 
acknowledged and discussed his SOR debts. There is no evidence of security 
violations, abuse of alcohol, or use of illegal drugs.  
The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more 
substantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial problems. His SOR, OPM 
PSI, and credit reports provide substantial evidence of 12 delinquent or collection 
accounts and one judgment totaling $19,328. He paid one $188 debt in 2014, and he 
has not made any payments to SOR creditors in 2015. He successfully disputed one 
$210 SOR debt. Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation of progress to 
resolve his financial problems. He did not provide any documentary evidence of

payments to SOR creditors, payment plans, or his communications to SOR creditors, 
showing his attempts to resolve his SOR debts. His failure to provide more 
corroborating documentation shows lack of financial responsibility and judgment and 
raises unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18. More specific and documented information 
about inability to pay debts or documented financial progress is necessary to mitigate 
security concerns. 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to 
Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a 
determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary to 
justify the award of a security clearance in the future. With more effort towards 
documented resolution of his past-due debts, and a track record of behavior consistent 
with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his 
security clearance worthiness. Based on the facts before me and the adjudicative 
guidelines that I am required to apply, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility at this time. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated.   
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.e through 1.m: Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
