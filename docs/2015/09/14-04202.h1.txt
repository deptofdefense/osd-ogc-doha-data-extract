RIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant is a 62-year-old consultant (independent contractor) employed by a 
defense contractor. He has a history of financial problems, including a current debt to 
the IRS for around $260,000 for tax years 2006 through 2012. He failed to establish 
financial responsibility in the handling of his legal obligations. Clearance denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 4, 
2012. On December 8, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) listing security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations).1 Applicant answered the SOR on December 31, 2014, and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 13, 2015. 
                                            
1 The DOD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended; and the Adjudicative Guidelines 
for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), implemented by the DOD on 
September 1, 2006.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued the notice of hearing on 
May 6, 2015, scheduling a hearing for June 3, 2015.  
 
At the hearing, the Government offered six exhibits (GE 1 through 6). Applicant 
testified, presented the testimony of an expert witness, and submitted 24 exhibits, 
marked AE 1 through 19, and AE 21 through 25. Applicant did not submit AE 20. All 
exhibits were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 
June 11, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
In his answer to the SOR, and at his hearing, Applicant admitted all of the SOR 
factual allegations. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, including his 
testimony and demeanor while testifying, I make the following findings of fact:  
 
Applicant is a 62-year-old consultant (independent contractor) employed by a 
defense contractor. He attended college and completed a bachelor’s degree in 1975. 
He married his first wife in 1983, and divorced in May 1999. He married his current wife 
in August 1999. He has four children, two of them are adults from his and his wife’s prior 
relationships, and two are from their current marriage.  
 
Applicant worked as a wage employee for a company from 2002 to 2005. He was 
unemployed during four months in 2003. He testified that for tax years 2002 through 
2005, he timely filed his income tax returns and paid his taxes. In 2005-2006, he was 
informed that he would have to become an independent contractor to be eligible for 
contracts. In 2006, he established his own company and became self-employed as an 
independent consultant. He has worked as an independent consultant for numerous 
federal contractors from 2006 to present. Applicant was unemployed during four months 
in 2009. Except for the two four-month periods of unemployment in 2003 and 2009, 
Applicant has been fully employed from 2002 to present. 
 
Applicant has possessed a security clearance for about 33 years. He was first 
granted access to classified information between 1979 and 1999. From 1999 to 2003, 
he had no need for a clearance, and his access was suspended. In 2003, Applicant 
returned to work for federal contractors, and his security clearance was reinstated. He 
requires a top secret clearance to continue working on his job. There is no evidence of 
any security problems or concerns during the time he has held a clearance, except for 
the concerns alleged in the current SOR. 
 
At his hearing, Applicant estimated his yearly earnings were around $120,000 in 
2005; $130,000 in 2006; $150,000 in 2007 through 2009; $175,000 in 2010; $200,000 
in 2011 and 2012; and around $250,000 a year from 2013 to present. He anticipates 
earning more than $250,000 a year during 2015 and 2016, because he has several 
contracts and his work hours will be increased. 
 
 
3 
 
 
Applicant testified that he timely filed his federal and state income tax returns for 
tax years 2002 through 2007. He did not timely file his federal and state income tax 
returns for tax years 2008 through 2012, which were filed together in 2012. Applicant 
did not pay estimated taxes for tax years 2006 through 2012, and he did not pay his 
federal and state taxes for tax years 2006 through 2012. He received IRS Forms 1099 
for each year he worked as an independent contractor between 2006 and 2014. 
 
Applicant disclosed in his 2012 SCA (Section 26 – Financial Record) that he had 
failed to timely pay his 2006 taxes because of “Lack of all funds for years 2006 to 
present. All forms submitted.” He stated that he estimated he owed the IRS and his 
state about $50,000 in back taxes. (GE 1)  
 
The background investigation addressed his financial problems and revealed that 
Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 1993, and his debts were 
discharged in 1994. Applicant explained that he was four months out of work and 
accumulated about $12,000 in credit card debt setting up a restaurant business with his 
ex-wife. He filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 1999, and his debts were 
discharged in 2002. Applicant explained that he was out of work for a period, was 
separated from his first wife, and incurred burial expenses associated with his father’s 
passing and his burial in Hawaii.  
 
The investigation also revealed that the IRS filed a lien against Applicant in 2012 
for around $93,000, two liens in 2013 for around $120,000, and that Applicant owed his 
state about $2,700 in delinquent taxes. The SOR factual allegations are established by 
the Government’s evidence and by Applicant’s testimony.  
 
Applicant provided a number of explanations about his failure to file income tax 
returns (2008 through 2012) and to pay his taxes (2006 through 2012). He testified that 
he was his family’s sole provider; he set up a restaurant in 1987 that depleted his 
savings and retirement accounts; he had extra living expenses while separated from his 
first wife pending their divorce (1998); his children were born in 1996 and 1998 and they 
had medical problems; he did not have medical insurance for him and his family 
between 2006 and 2014, and incurred hundreds of thousands in medical bills; his in-
laws lived with him for four years (and other relatives during periods of time), and he 
supported and paid his father-in-law’s medical and burial expenses; and he was 
unemployed for four months both in 2003 and 2009.  
 
Additionally, Applicant explained that he incorporated himself to be able to 
compete for contracts as an independent consultant. He averred he was not made 
aware of his tax responsibilities and legal obligations, and he did not make any 
estimated tax payments from 2006 to 2012. 
 
Applicant’s documents show that he purchased two timeshares in 1996-1997; he 
bought a boat and trailer for $42,000 (cash) in 2005; he bought a 55 acre farm in 
another state for $110,000 (paid $85,000 cash) in 2009; he bought a $30,000 car for his 
wife in 2010; he bought (or refinanced) a car for his son in 2012; and he bought a 
 
4 
 
 
$32,000 car in 2013. To afford the farm, Applicant had to refinance his personal home, 
and at some point was paying around $7,000 a month in mortgage payments. 
 
Applicant purchased the farm as a retirement and investment property. He was 
anticipating being able to sell the gas rights on the property for an amount between 
$500,000 and one million dollars a year. However, the governor of the state banned 
fracking, and Applicant will not be able to do so.  
 
In 2010, Applicant started to pay his past-due taxes. He paid $25,000 to the IRS, 
and $7,000 to his state. In 2011, the IRS started its efforts to collect Applicant’s past-
due taxes. Applicant hired an attorney in December 2011, to help him resolve his 
problems with the IRS and his state. After Applicant started his efforts to establish a 
payment plan with the IRS in 2012, the IRS suspended its garnishments and levies 
against Applicant. Applicant established a payment plan with his state and is making 
payments.  
 
Applicant anticipates being able to pay $5,000 a month to the IRS, and about 
$400 to his state to pay his past-due taxes. Additionally, he claimed that he intends to 
sell some of his property to accelerate the payment of his tax debt. Applicant placed his 
farm for sale in December 2014. He also placed his boat and a car for sale the week 
before his hearing.   
 
Applicant expressed remorse for his financial situation and accepted 
responsibility for his financial problems. He admitted that he did not manage properly 
his tax debt. He believes that he has been truthful and forthcoming during the security 
clearance process. Applicant testified that he has specialized knowledge and expertise 
that make him a valuable asset. He is considered to be a valuable employee who 
makes significant contributions to his employers. Applicant’s current employer supports 
his eligibility for a security clearance.  
 
Policies 
 
Eligibility for access to classified information may be granted “only upon a finding 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). 
 
The AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person’s 
suitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating 
condition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case 
can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to 
classified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
consideration of the whole person and the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a). All available, 
 
5 
 
 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, 
must be considered.  
 
Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s security clearance. The Government 
must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, 
the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The 
applicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  
 
Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship 
with the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a 
compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. 
The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard compels resolution of any 
reasonable doubt about an applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the Government. 
“[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” 
Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG ¶ 2(b). Clearance decisions are not a determination of the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication that the applicant has 
or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 Under Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within 
one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-
control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which 
can raise questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having 
to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. (AG ¶ 18) 
 
The evidence established that Applicant has a long history of financial problems. 
He filed for bankruptcy protection in 1993 and 1999. He failed to file federal and state 
income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2012, and he failed to pay his federal and 
state taxes from 2006 through 2012. As a result, he owes the IRS around $260,000, 
and the IRS filed tax liens against him in 2012 and 2013. Financial considerations 
disqualifying conditions AG ¶ 19(a): “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG 
¶ 19(c): “a history of not meeting financial obligations,” apply. 
 
 AG ¶ 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations 
security concerns:  
 
 
6 
 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue; and 
 
 (f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. 
 
 Considering the evidence as a whole, I find that none of the financial 
considerations mitigating conditions fully apply, and they do not mitigate the financial 
considerations security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems are ongoing, and he 
owes a substantial debt. The circumstances under which he acquired his tax debts 
continue to cast doubt on Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. 
 
 I considered Applicant’s assertions that the debts became delinquent because of 
his 1998 divorce; his four-month periods of unemployment in 2003 and 2009; his lack of 
medical insurance from 2006 to 2014, and the extensive medical expenses he paid for 
himself, his family, and relatives; and that he was the sole provider for his family and for 
other relatives during extended periods. Applicant’s unemployment periods and divorce 
could be considered as circumstances beyond his control that contributed or aggravated 
his financial problems. Notwithstanding, considering the evidence as a whole, 
Applicant’s evidence is insufficient to show financial responsibility. 
 
 Applicant has been fully employed and received substantial yearly earnings from 
2006, when he earned about $130,000, to present. His earnings have progressively 
increased to around $250,000 a year for the last three years. Applicant did not have 
medical insurance because he elected not to purchase medical insurance for himself 
and his family. 
 
 Applicant’s liens and tax debt resulted from his failure to timely file state and 
federal income tax returns, his failure to pay estimated taxes, and his failure to pay his 
 
7 
 
 
yearly taxes. Applicant claimed he was ignorant of the tax laws and that he made an 
honest mistake when he failed to pay estimated taxes because he did not know the tax 
rules and responsibilities applicable to an independent contractor. His claims and 
explanations lack credibility in light of the record evidence.  
 
 Applicant did not have tax problems before 2006. He timely filed his income tax 
returns until 2007. Thus, he knew of his responsibility and legal obligation to file his 
income tax returns and to pay his taxes. Applicant failed to file his income tax returns for 
tax years 2008 through 2012, which were filed late in 2012. Moreover, he failed to pay 
his federal and state taxes from 2006 to 2012. Instead of paying his taxes, or buying 
medical insurance for himself and his family, Applicant chose to use his income to buy a 
boat ($42,000), three cars (around $72,000), and a farm ($110,000). His actions show 
an unwillingness to follow the law and lack of judgment. 
 
 Applicant claimed that his financial problems are under control because he 
retained an attorney in 2011 to help him resolve his tax problems, his high earnings will 
allow him to make substantial monthly payments to the IRS, he paid about $32,000 to 
the state and IRS, and he is in negotiations to establish a payment plan with the IRS in 
the near future. He also believes that he has a viable payment plan because he 
anticipates selling some of his property to make lump sum payments towards his tax 
debt. He presented evidence to show that he established a payment plan with his state. 
 
 Notwithstanding, his recent efforts to pay his tax debt, Applicant’s unresolved tax 
debt and his lack of financial responsibility cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and judgment. He has received substantial earnings since 2006, and 
he failed to timely file his income tax returns or to pay his taxes. Applicant does not 
have an established payment plan to pay his federal taxes, nor has he sold any of his 
property to make the promised lump sum payments. Considering the evidence as a 
whole, Applicant failed to show financial responsibility and sufficient progress in the 
resolution of his tax debts. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person 
concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-
person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, 
but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 62-year-old consultant working for defense contractors as an 
independent contractor since 2006. He has possessed a security clearance during the 
last 33 years, without security concerns except for those in the current SOR. He failed 
to submit sufficient evidence to establish financial responsibility in the handling of his 
financial obligations.  
 
 
8 
 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
 Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:    For Applicant 
 
 Subparagraphs 1.c - 1.f:     Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant eligibility for a security clearance to 
Applicant. Clearance is denied.
