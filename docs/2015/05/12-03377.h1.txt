GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations and personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to 
classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 20, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On June 28, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued him a set of interrogatories.  He 
responded to the interrogatories on September 6, 2013.2 On August 6, 2014, the DOD 
CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended 
and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the

Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information 
(December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations 
made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security 
concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. In a statement, notarized September 5, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a 
hearing.3 A complete copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was 
provided to Applicant on February 23, 2015, and he was afforded an opportunity, within 
a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in 
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished 
a copy of the Directive as well as the Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant 
received the FORM on March 12, 2015. Although the memorandum to me indicated that 
Applicant had submitted information in response to the FORM,4 there is nothing from 
him in the case file. The case was assigned to me on May 20, 2015.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted one of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (¶ 1.a.). He denied the remaining 
allegations pertaining to financial considerations and personal conduct. Applicant’s 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as a software quality engineer with his current employer since October 2014.5 
He was previously unemployed from July 2006 until October 2006.6 Applicant graduated 
from high school in 1992.7 He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and served on active duty 
from September 1992 until September 1996 when he was discharged under other than 
honorable conditions (UOTHC).8 He was granted a top secret security clearance in

1992.9 Applicant was married in August 1996, and divorced two weeks later that same 
month after he found out his wife was cheating on him.10 He has one daughter from 
another relationship, born in 2005.11 
 
Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct 
 
 It is unclear when Applicant first experienced financial difficulties, but a review of 
his December 2011 credit report reveals12 at least one delinquent account as early as 
2008.13 That account was charged off and the balance was eventually paid off.14 
Applicant claimed that in 1996, he was under a lot of stress because he had some 
financial problems “due to not being reasonable as an adult and not reaching out for 
help when [he] realized that [he] needed help.”15 Other accounts became delinquent in 
2010.16 
 
In early 1996, upon his arrival at his new duty station, Applicant used his 
government credit card to rent a motor vehicle for one week. He failed to return the 
vehicle and charges continued to accrue. He informed his commander of the 
unauthorized continued use of the credit card, and the matter was referred to the base 
legal office. Applicant was charged with violations of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military 
Justice (UCMJ), for the unauthorized use of his government credit card; Article 107, 
UCMJ, for making a false official statement with intent to deceive (related to the credit 
card balance); and Article 107, UCMJ, for making false official statements with intent to 
deceive (related to an additional $1,000 charge). Rather than face a court-martial, 
Applicant submitted the paperwork for an administrative discharge in lieu of a court-
martial, and he was discharged with the UOTHC.17 
 
It is unclear how or why Applicant’s finances deteriorated to the point where his 
accounts were not timely addressed by him to prevent them from becoming delinquent, 
placed for collection, or charged off. Applicant reported no major illnesses or other 
significant issues such as a loss of employment, divorce, or other unexpected incidents 
that were largely beyond his control. Applicant has offered no documentation to support

any plan or positive action with his creditors. There is no evidence to indicate that 
Applicant ever received financial counseling. 
  
In August 2013, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement indicating his 
net monthly income was $2,142.48; and his monthly household or debt expenses were 
$946; leaving him $1,196.48 remaining at the end of each month for discretionary use 
or savings.18  Applicant’s annual salary was $62,318.19 
 
 (SOR ¶ 2.a.): On December 20, 2011, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he 
responded to questions pertaining to his financial record. Three of those questions in 
Section 26 – Financial Record (Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts) – asked if, in 
the past seven years, he had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; if he had 
any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as 
agreed; if he was currently over 120 days delinquent on any debt (include financial 
obligations for which you are the sole debtor, as well as those for which you are a co-
signer or guarantor)? Applicant answered “no” to those questions. He certified that the 
responses were “true, complete, and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief,20 
but the responses to those questions were, in fact, false for at that time Applicant had 
several accounts that were either placed for collection, charged off, or cancelled. He 
subsequently said that he was not sure why he answered those questions the way he 
did.21 He later denied intending to falsify his response, and explained that when he 
completed the e-QIP, he had no knowledge of his debts as he had not previously 
obtained a credit report.22 
 
The SOR identified four purportedly continuing delinquent debts totaling 
approximately $11,863 that had been placed for collection or charged off, as reflected 
by a December 2011 credit report;23 a June 2013 credit report;24 an April 2014 credit 
report;25 and a July 2014 credit report.26 Those debts and their respective current 
status, according to the credit reports and Applicant’s admissions regarding the same, 
are described below.

(SOR ¶ 1.a.): There is a bank automobile loan with an unpaid balance of $10,142 
that was placed for collection and charged off.27 Applicant explained that in 2010, he 
was involved in an automobile accident with an uninsured motorist, and the incident was 
not covered by Applicant’s insurance policy. Since he could not afford the repairs, 
estimated to be $10,000, he voluntarily returned the vehicle to the bank, assuming it 
would be sold at auction. At the time the vehicle was surrendered, Applicant owed about 
$9,000 on the loan. Although he had no intention of paying the debt, when he was 
interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in 
February 2012, Applicant changed his mind and said he would attempt to negotiate a 
settlement with the creditor.28 As of the date he responded to the SOR, Applicant had 
taken no steps to resolve the debt.29 The account has not been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): There is a credit union account that was opened in 2009 and 
closed in 2010 before one check had cleared, leaving an overdraft balance of $518. The 
account was placed for collection and charged off.30 Applicant acknowledged receiving 
a collection notice from the creditor, but he “never got around to pay the debt and forgot 
about it.”31 During his OPM interview, Applicant said he would make arrangements to 
pay off the debt immediately.32 Although Applicant contended he subsequently paid the 
account in full,33 he failed to submit any documentation to support his contention. In the 
absence of such documentation, I conclude that the account has not been resolved.  
 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): There is a medical debt for treatment received by Applicant in 2008 
in the amount of $264 that was placed for collection.34 Applicant claimed that he was 
under the impression the bill had been paid by his insurance, and he never thought 
about it. During his OPM interview, Applicant said he would make arrangements to pay 
off the debt immediately.35 As of the date he responded to the interrogatories, Applicant 
had taken no steps to resolve the debt.36 The account has not been resolved.

(SOR ¶ 1.d.): There is a bank credit card account with a balance of $300 that 
was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser.37 The new creditor increased the 
unpaid balance initially to $939, and then to $990.38 Applicant acknowledged using the 
credit card for everyday expenses, including food, gas, clothing, and entertainment, and 
gave it to his girlfriend to use because her credit was too poor to obtain her own card. 
She agreed to pay for her charges, but did not. Instead, she charged up to $800 before 
Applicant took the card from her.39 Applicant called the original creditor and explained 
the circumstances, but the bank said he was still responsible for the charges. He 
disagreed and never made any payments.40 During his OPM interview, Applicant said 
he would make arrangements with the new creditor to settle the debt.41 As of the date 
he responded to the interrogatories, and later to the SOR, Applicant had taken no steps 
to resolve the debt.42 The account has not been resolved. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”43 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”44   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The

administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”45 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.46  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”47 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”48 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant has had a long-standing problem with his finances which 
started as early as 2008. It is unclear if he found himself with insufficient funds to 
continue making his routine monthly payments or if he simply chose to stop doing so, 
and various accounts became delinquent, and were placed for collection or charged off.  
AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
    
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”49 In addition, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply if “the individual has a reasonable 
                                                          
49
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].  
 
9 
                                      
 
basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem 
and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do not apply. The nature, frequency, 
and recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties since about 2008 make it 
difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” Applicant was 
previously unemployed from July 2006 until October 2006, but that relatively brief period 
was well before his financial problems arose. Applicant offered no evidence of a good-
faith effort to resolve any of his debts and essentially ignored them until relatively 
recently. He failed to submit any documentation such as receipts, cancelled checks, 
account records, etc., to support his contentions that one of his delinquent accounts 
was resolved. Likewise, there is the absence of documentation regarding possible debt 
consolidation, disputes, or any continuing contacts with his creditors. There is no 
evidence to indicate that Applicant ever received financial counseling. It appears that he 
has funds remaining at the end of each month for discretionary use or savings, but there 
is no evidence that he has taken any steps to resolve his delinquent accounts with that 
money. There is no evidence to reflect that Applicant’s financial problems are under 
control. Applicant has not acted responsibly by failing to address his delinquent 
accounts and by making little, if any, efforts of working with his creditors.50 Applicant’s 
actions under the circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, 
and good judgment.51 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG & 15:       
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case

 The guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns. Under AG ¶ 
16(a), it is potentially disqualifying if there is a 
deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
 As noted above, on December 20, 2011, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, 
he responded to certain questions pertaining to his financial record. The questions in 
Section 26 – Financial Record asked if, asked if, in the past seven years, he had bills or 
debts turned over to a collection agency; if he had any account or credit card 
suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed; if he was currently 
over 120 days delinquent on any debt (include financial obligations for which you are 
the sole debtor, as well as those for which you are a co-signer or guarantor)? Applicant 
answered “no” to those questions. He certified that the responses were “true, complete, 
and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief, but the responses to those 
questions were, in fact, false.  
 
 Applicant’s responses provide sufficient evidence to examine if his submissions 
were deliberate falsifications, as alleged in the SOR, or merely the result of 
misunderstanding the true facts on his part. Applicant subsequently denied intending to 
falsify his responses and explained that when he completed the e-QIP, he had no 
knowledge of his debts as he had not previously obtained a credit report, and that he 
was not sure why he answered those questions the way he did.  
 
 I have considered Applicant’s background, professional career, including his 
military service, and his seemingly superficial understanding of financial matters, in 
analyzing his actions. Applicant was previously charged with violations of Article 92, 
UCMJ, for the unauthorized use of his government credit card; Article 107, UCMJ, for 
making a false official statement with intent to deceive (related to the credit card 
balance); and Article 107, UCMJ, for making false official statements with intent to 
deceive (related to an additional $1,000 charge). Rather than face a court-martial, 
Applicant submitted the paperwork for an administrative discharge in lieu of a court-
martial, and he was discharged with the UOTHC. Applicant’s history reflects a lack of 
candor and honesty. As it pertains to the alleged deliberate falsifications, Applicant’s 
superficial explanation is insufficient to refute AG ¶ 16(a).52

 The Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving 
falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant’s 
intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record 
evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the 
applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.53   
     
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He has been 
with his current employer since October 2014. He was previously briefly unemployed 
from July 2006 until October 2006. He has declared his intention of addressing his 
creditors and resolving his financial problems.  
  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Other than the historical record as to Applicant’s character, and his lack of integrity, 
reliability, and judgment while in the U.S. Air Force, there is no evidence from third-
parties as to his current reputation for reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. 
Rather than face a court-martial for misconduct, Applicant submitted the paperwork for 
an administrative discharge in lieu of a court-martial, and he was discharged with the 
UOTHC. His lack of candor, in addition to his long-standing failure to repay his creditors, 
even in the smallest amounts, or to arrange payment plans, reflect traits which raise 
concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. Despite his promises to resolve 
his delinquent accounts, Applicant has essentially taken no positive actions to do so. 
Applicant’s actions under the circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. Considering the relative absence of confirmed debt 
resolution and elimination efforts, Applicant’s financial issues are likely to remain.

The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:54 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of ‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.’ However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has ‘. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.’ The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (‘Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.’) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated an essentially negative track record of debt 
reduction and elimination efforts, generally ignoring his debts.  Overall, the evidence 
leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a 
security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate 
the security concerns arising from his financial considerations and his personal conduct. 
See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant   
Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a:    Against Applicant

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
