Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny him a security
clearance to work in the defense industry. He has a history of financial problems or
difficulties consisting of federal income tax problems and collection accounts. He did not
produce sufficient evidence to rebut, extenuate, mitigate, or explain his unresolved
federal income tax problems. Accordingly, this case is decided against  Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on April 11, 2013.  After reviewing the application and1
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

(DOD),  on October 17, 2014, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining2
it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him
eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint. It3
detailed the reasons for the action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for
financial considerations. Applicant answered the SOR in an undated response wherein
he admitted the SOR allegations and provided a one-page memorandum explaining his
admissions. Neither Applicant nor Department Counsel requested a hearing, and so,
the case will be decided on the written record.4
On February 26, 2015, Department Counsel submitted all relevant and material
information that could be adduced at a hearing.  This so-called file of relevant material5
(FORM) was mailed to Applicant, who received it on March 31, 2015. Applicant did  not
reply within 30 days from receipt of the FORM. The case was assigned to me on May
21, 2015.   
Ruling on Evidence
Exhibit 3 is a report of investigation (ROI) from the background investigation of
Applicant. The document is a summary of an interview of Applicant conducted on May
7, 2013. An ROI may be received and considered as evidence when it is authenticated
by a witness.  Here, Exhibit 3 is not authenticated in any way. Although Applicant, who6
is representing himself, has not raised the issue via an objection, I am raising it sua
sponte. With that said, it is evident that Department Counsel is acting in good faith,
having highlighted the issue in their brief.  Nevertheless, Applicant’s lack of response to7

advantage; the party alleged to have waived a right must have had both knowledge of the existing right and
the intention of forgoing it.” Black’s Law Dictionary, 1717 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9  ed., W est 2009).th

the FORM does not amount to a knowing waiver of the rule.  Accordingly, Exhibit 3 is8
not admissible and I have not considered it.
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 50-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security
clearance. He is employed by a federal contractor, and he is working at a U.S. military
installation in Japan. Before that, he was unemployed from December 2009 until he
began his current job in 2013. Before that, he was employed as a track mechanic for a
federal contractor from November 2003 to December 2009; his work location was South
Korea. And before that, he was employed as a track mechanic for a federal contractor
from June 2000 to November 2003; his work location was Kuwait. His employment
history also includes honorable military service in the U.S. Army during 1986–1994. 
Applicant has a history of financial problems, which he does not dispute. In
disclosing those financial problems in his 2013 security clearance application, he stated
that he needed to get back to work to take care of his financial obligations. An April 19,
2013 credit report,  which was obtained during the background investigation, confirms9
those financial problems as follows: (1) a state tax lien for $1,775 filed in December
2001 and subsequently paid and released in July 2006; (2) a federal tax lien for $6,978
filed in May 2003 and not yet released; (3) a state tax lien for $1,679 filed in March 2010
and subsequently paid and released in June 2011; (4) an unpaid collection account for
$90; (5) an unpaid medical collection account for $1,736; and (6) an unpaid medical
collection account for $40. A more recent credit report from February 2015 shows (1)
the state tax lien filed in 2010 and released in 2011, (2) an unpaid $239 collection
account, and (3) an unpaid $40 medical collection account.  10
The SOR limited itself to four allegations as follows: (1) the May 2003 federal tax
lien for $6,978; (2) $6,497 in back taxes owed to the IRS for tax year 2006; (3) failure to
file federal income tax returns for tax years 2001, 2003, 2006, and 2010; and (4) the
unpaid medical collection account for $1,736. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant
admitted these matters, but he did provide any documentation showing that they are
paid, settled, in repayment, forgiven, cancelled, in dispute, or otherwise resolved.
Concerning the federal income tax matters, he explained he was working on the
problem, and he believed he was in a tax-free status while he was working in Kuwait
and South Korea. Concerning the unpaid medical collection account, he stated that he
thought it had been paid, and he intended to resolve it by the end of November 2014.
To date, he has not submitted any documentation showing that his federal income tax

matters are resolved or in the process of being resolved, and the same goes for the
unpaid medical collection account. 
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As11
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt12
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An13
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  14
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting15
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An16
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate17
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme18
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.19
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.20

 AG ¶ 18.  24

The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it21
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant22
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 23
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  24
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly compromise
classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It encompasses
concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important qualities. A
person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or
negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. Taken together, the evidence indicates inability or unwillingness

to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning25 26
of Guideline F. In addition, his failure to file federal income tax returns is disqualifying.27
 In mitigation, I have considered six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and28
I have especially considered the following as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or death, divorce, or
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances;
and
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.
Applicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties, some of which are
likely related to his period of unemployment from the end of 2009 to sometime in 2013,
when he started his current job. For example, it appears the unpaid medical collection
account for $1,736 was incurred during this period, and so, SOR ¶ 1.d is decided for
Applicant.  He is also entitled to some credit in mitigation by resolving the state tax29
liens as reflected in the two credit reports.30
But other than failing to file the 2010 federal income tax return, his federal
income tax problems were incurred before his period of unemployment. Moreover, he
seems to be relying on a misunderstanding of federal tax law that his overseas
employment in Kuwait during 2000–2003 and South Korea during 2003–2009 placed
him in a tax-free status. He is mistaken, because if a person is a U.S. citizen or resident
alien living abroad, that person is taxed on their worldwide income, although they may
qualify for the foreign earned income and foreign housing exclusions and the foreign
housing deduction.  Applicant has not submitted any documentation showing progress,31
or even a plan (e.g., hiring a CPA, a tax attorney, or other tax professional to assist him

would be a good start), in resolving his tax problems with the IRS, and those matters
are considered to be wholly unresolved.  
Of course, the purpose of this case is not aimed at collecting debts or enforcing
tax laws.  Rather, the purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and32
trustworthiness consistent with the guidelines in the Directive. In evaluating Guideline F
cases, the Appeal Board has established the following standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of a meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant
actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement
that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.33
Here, the evidence does not support a conclusion that Applicant has established a plan
and taken steps to implement that plan sufficient to mitigate the concern. Actions speak
louder than words, and Applicant has not taken documented actions to resolve his
federal income tax problems.   
Because Applicant chose to have his case decided without a hearing, I am
unable to evaluate his demeanor. Limited to the written record, I am unable to assess
his sincerity, candor, or truthfulness. He also chose not to respond to the FORM with
relevant and material facts about his circumstances, which may have helped to explain,
extenuate, or mitigate the security concern. 
Given those circumstances, Applicant’s history of financial problems creates
doubt about his reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect
classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice
versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I34

conclude that he did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified
information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.c: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.d: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified
information is denied.
