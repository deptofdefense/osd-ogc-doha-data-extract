Decision

MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant owes over $100,000 in delinquent consumer credit card debt. Most of the 
debt, if not all, was incurred during his second marriage. Four credit card judgments have 
been satisfied through wage garnishment, but more progress is needed toward resolving his 
delinquent debt to mitigate the security concerns about his financial judgment. Clearance is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On October 3, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security 
concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and explaining why it was unable to 
find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance 
eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
 
 2 
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations on October 29, 2014. He requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) if necessary to keep his job. On December 9, 2014, the case was assigned to me 
to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On December 17, 2014, I issued a 
Notice of Hearing scheduling the hearing for January 14, 2015. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. The Government submitted seven exhibits 
(GEs 1-7) and the Applicant submitted 11 exhibits (AEs A-K), all of which were admitted 
without any objections. A chart, which was prepared by Department Counsel as a 
supplement to his oral closing argument, was marked as a hearing exhibit, but not 
accepted as a formal exhibit in the record. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript 
(Tr.) received on January 26, 2015. 
 
At Applicant’s request, I held the record open for three weeks for him to submit 
additional documentary evidence. On January 29, 2015, Applicant submitted two exhibits. 
Department Counsel filed no objections by the February 10, 2015 deadline for comment. 
Applicant’s submissions were marked and received as AEs L and M. On February 2, 2015, 
Applicant submitted evidence of a satisfaction of judgment. The document was marked and 
admitted as AE N, without objection. 
 
Summary of SOR Allegations 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of October 3, 2014, Applicant owed 
delinquent consumer credit debt totaling $115,084 on ten accounts (SOR 1.a-1.j). When he 
answered the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts, except for a $9,087 credit card debt 
(SOR 1.b) because it had been paid. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following 
findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 59-year-old rigger, first class. He has worked for his employer since 
February 1999. He was previously employed by the same defense contractor from 
November 1982 to October 1996. (Tr. 28.) Applicant seeks to retain the secret-level 
security clearance that was renewed around June 2001. (GE 1.) He held security 
clearances in the past at the confidential and secret levels. (GE 2.) 
 
Applicant was married to his first wife from November 1991 to June 2001. In late 
June 2001, he married his second wife. (GE 1; Tr. 30.) They shared a home that Applicant 
bought in April 1991 for $105,000. (GE 1; Tr. 30-31, 40.) In May 2002, Applicant took out a 
home equity loan of $38,400 to renovate their kitchen. About a month after they started 
construction, his second wife stopped working, apparently for medical reasons. The 
financial strain caused by the loss of her income was exacerbated by Applicant’s and his 
spouse’s “very destructive” spending habits. They relied heavily on consumer credit for 
 
 3 
purchases throughout their marriage. By 2008, Applicant had 12 credit cards and his 
spouse had 20 credit cards. They exhausted some $70,000 of her severance pay from a 
previous job by going out to eat three or four times a week, and buying clothing and other 
items that they did not need. (Tr. 34, 37-39, 64-65.) 
 
Around 2008, their creditors started doubling the minimum monthly payments on 
their credit cards. (Tr. 34-35.) Applicant’s second wife handled the finances during their 
marriage, and she started skipping payments on some credit card accounts. Their debt 
“snowballed.” By late 2008, they were receiving notices of delinquency in the mail and 
many collection calls. (GE 6; Tr. 35.) Applicant was overwhelmed by the debt delinquency 
and did not know what to do. They made some payments where they could, and some 
accounts went unpaid. By the time Applicant and his second wife separated in early 
January 2010, several of Applicant’s credit accounts had been charged off or placed for 
collection or both, as shown in the following table.

 Applicant refinanced his home loan three times during his second marriage. (Tr. 41.) 
In May 1999, he refinanced for $80,000. In May 2007, he and his spouse took out a 
mortgage of $202,500 with a new lender. (GE 5.) He rolled $10,000 in debt owed for a 
motorcycle and some credit card debt into the new loan. (Tr. 41.) In March 2008, they 
refinanced for $207,000. He was chronically 30 days late in making his mortgage payments 
in 2009. Around early January 2010, Applicant and his second wife separated. He fell 
 
 6 
behind three months in his mortgage payment in the spring of 2010. In June 2010, he 
brought his mortgage current through a hardship loan from his 401(k). (GE 5; Tr. 40, 92.) 
 
 On September 7, 2010, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). Applicant disclosed the 
debts in SOR 1.a-1.e, 1.g, and 1.i; several other consumer credit debts totaling around 
$50,000 (not alleged); and a $470.55 medical debt (not alleged). Applicant indicated that 
he was repaying the medical debt at $25 a month; the debt in SOR 1.b at $35 a week; the 
$15,411 and $18,204 debts at $35 each a week; and an $8,167 collection debt at $25 a 
week. (GE 1.) Available evidence shows that payments made on the large debt balances 
owed on three accounts with the creditor identified in SOR 1.b were by garnishment of his 
wages. (AE L.) 
 
 On November 16, 2010, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) partially about his delinquent debts. Applicant 
explained that his then estranged spouse handled the finances in their house. When he 
confronted her about collection notices, they separated. He indicated that he did not have a 
good understanding of all his accounts, although he did not doubt that he owed the debts 
on his credit record. He added that he used his credit cards for routine living expenses, 
such as food, household expenses, and car expenses. Applicant took the financial record 
information on his e-QIP from collection notices.  He expressed his intent to pay off his 
debts as he was able to do so. He added that he was living on a strict budget and that he 
had adjusted his spending. (GE 6.) 
 
 In November 2011, Applicant and his second wife were divorced. Applicant retained 
his house. (GE 1; Tr. 30-31.) She got his motorcycle and the balance of his 401(k) 
(approximately $14,000) in the divorce settlement. (Tr. 31.) In December 2013, Applicant 
obtained a modification of his mortgage taking on a 40-year loan of $234,000. He lowered 
his monthly payment by approximately $628 to $1,166. He was behind in his mortgage 
payments when he sought the modification. After he made three months of payments, the 
lender modified his loan. (GEs 3, 7; Tr. 43-44, 95-97.) 
 
 In July 2010, the agency collecting three of Applicant’s credit card delinquencies 
(SOR 1.b, $14,529, and $16,766), began to attach Applicant’s wages to collect the $14,529 
debt. (AE L; Tr. 50.) Available leave and earnings statements from July 11, 2010, to 
December 4, 2011, show that a second writ of garnishment was filed with his employer in 
October 2010. Applicant was repaying two loans from his 401(k) at $13.11 and $36.78 a 
week.
1 
In February 2011 and September 2011, third and fourth writs of garnishment were 
filed against his wages. (AE L.) By October 2014, two new garnishments had been filed.  
As of January 2015, four of seven judgments filed against him have been paid through 
garnishment, including the debt in SOR 1.b. (AEs F-H, N; Tr. 79-80.) Two garnishments 
are pending execution. Applicant does not know which of his remaining creditors filed to 
attach his wages. (AE A; Tr. 78-79.) Applicant intends to continue to pay his debts through 
                                                 
1 
Applicant testified that he took a second loan from his 401(k), of $2,000, to pay state income taxes owed for 
2013. (Tr. 93-94.) However, Applicant’s wage and earnings statements show that two 401(k) loans as of July 
2010, well before a state tax debt for 2013 would have been incurred.  
 
 7 
involuntary garnishment. Since the payments are automatically deducted from his wages, 
he does not have to worry about “spending it beforehand.” (Tr. 59.)    
 
 Applicant and his current wife married in April 2012. They have been cohabiting 
since June 2010. (GE 1; Tr. 32.) She receives a social security disability benefit of $900 a 
month and does not work outside the home. (Tr. 32-33, 59.) 
 
 Applicant has not had any credit or financial counseling. He consulted with an 
attorney about possibly filing for bankruptcy, but he has been led to believe from others 
that he will lose his job if he files. (Tr. 46, 86.) He also cannot afford to file for bankruptcy. 
The attorney wanted $3,000 upfront. (Tr. 89-90.) Applicant’s job is more important to him 
than his house or his car. (Tr. 46.) Applicant has taken no steps to sell his house because 
it is worth less than what he currently owes ($180,000 as of November 2014). (GE 7; Tr. 
46-47.) 
 
 Applicant does not have any open credit card accounts. He does not intend to open 
any new credit card accounts. (Tr. 65.) His income tax refund goes toward medical bills. 
(Tr. 47.) He received federal and state income tax refunds totaling $3,000 for tax year 
2014. He spent the refunds for a transmission for his truck, and $1,000 went toward 
medical bills. (Tr. 82.) He drives a 2001 model-year truck that he paid off in October 2005. 
(GE 4; Tr. 55.) His monthly expenses are $1,116 for his mortgage, around $50 for car 
insurance, almost $60 for cable services, $60 for his and his spouse’s cell phones, $165 on 
average for electricity, and   for his and his spouse’s medications. (Tr. 57-58.) At his hourly 
wage of $27.27, shift differential pay, and double overtime pay, Applicant took home $844 
for the last week of December 2014. He took home between $650 and $675 a week in the 
fall of 2014 due to the garnishment of his wages. (AE A.) 
 
 Applicant’s supervisors consider Applicant to be an asset to the rigging department. 
He is highly motivated, tackles the toughest job assignments, and adheres to safety 
requirements. They trust him to safeguard classified information. (AEs B, E.) An area 
superintendent attests to the pride that Applicant takes in his work and to his willingness to 
work weekends when asked. (AE M.) Applicant’s work partner for the last ten years has 
known Applicant for about 32 years. In his opinion, Applicant makes “good judgment calls” 
and is trustworthy. (AE D.) Another longtime co-worker attests to Applicant complaining 
about a spouse’s spending habits. He believes Applicant is trying very hard to repay his 
debts and does not consider him a security risk. (AE C.)  
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
 
 8 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern about financial considerations is articulated in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 
 9 
 The Guideline F concerns are amply established. Applicant and his second wife 
overextended themselves financially by spending beyond what they could reasonably 
afford. By the time of their marital separation in early 2010, Applicant’s delinquent 
consumer credit debt exceeded $100,000. Several of his past-due debts were not alleged 
in the SOR, including two debts around $15,411 and $18,204 owed to the lender identified 
in SOR 1.b. The agency collecting for the lender in SOR 1.b obtained judgments against 
Applicant on all three accounts, which were satisfied by involuntary wage garnishment in 
April 2012, May 2013, and September 2014, respectively. After the satisfaction of these 
large debts, Applicant owed approximately $105,662 on the past-due accounts in SOR 1.a 
and 1.c-1.j as of October 2014. By his own admission (GE 1), he owes another $6,616 in 
unalleged delinquent consumer credit debt that remains unpaid.
2
 Debts not alleged cannot 
provide a separate basis for disqualification,
3
 but they clearly show that Applicant had 
financial problems beyond those alleged in the SOR. Three disqualifying conditions under 
AG ¶ 19 apply: 
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(e) consistent spending beyond one’s means, which may be indicated by 
excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income 
ratio, and/or other financial analysis. 
 
Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current, reliability, or good judgment,” applies only in that the 
debts became delinquent around 2008. AG ¶ 20(a) does not mitigate Applicant’s failure to 
take action to address his past-due debts. Creditors had to resort to filing for judgments 
and writs of garnishment to collect debts. 
 
Applicant’s second wife handled the finances, and he did not realize the extent of 
their delinquency until they were seriously behind. Even so, he is legally responsible for the 
debts incurred on his accounts. He admitted that both he and his second wife had “very 
destructive” spending habits. They went through $70,000 in severance pay she received in 
addition to incurring consumer credit beyond what they could reasonably afford.  Applicant 
opened several consumer credit card accounts, including those identified in SOR 1.c-1.f 
and 1.j, after his second wife had stopped working due to medical issues around 2002 or 
                                                 
2 
The $6,166 does not include the $2,466 credit card judgment (not alleged) that was entered against 
Applicant in February 2011. The judgment was satisfied in January 2015. (AE N.) 
 
3 
The DOHA Appeal Board has long held that the administrative judge may consider non-alleged conduct to 
assess an applicant’s credibility; to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed 
circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide 
whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for a whole 
person analysis under Section 6.3 of the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 
2006); ISCR Case No. 09-07219 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2012). The unalleged delinquencies are relevant to 
assessing Applicant’s financial judgment generally and the risk of recurrence. 
 
 10 
2003. He exercised questionable judgment when he doubled his mortgage debt through a 
refinance in which he rolled $10,000 in debt for a motorcycle and unspecified credit card 
debt. AG ¶ 20(b) is not established under these circumstances: 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
 
 Through involuntary garnishment of his wages starting around July 2010, Applicant 
has satisfied four judgment debts, including SOR 1.b. The resolution of these debts, three 
of which were not alleged in the SOR, implicates AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is 
receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control.” However, AG ¶ 20(c) does not apply to most of the 
debts in the SOR toward which Applicant has made no payments. Applicant has not had 
any financial counseling. 
 
 Furthermore, debts paid so belatedly by involuntary garnishment and after financial 
judgments are not afforded the same weight in mitigation as had Applicant contacted his 
creditors and attempted to settle them. AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith 
effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,” applies only in that an $882 
collection debt (not alleged) was settled for less than its full balance, and that he consulted 
a lawyer about a possible bankruptcy. When asked about his plans to address his debts 
going forward, Applicant plans to continue to resolve his debts through garnishment (“Well, 
it works. It’s simple . . . It comes out automatically, so I don’t have to worry about—
spending it beforehand.” (Tr. 59.) While Applicant can legally choose to pay his debts 
through garnishment, he would have a stronger case in mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) if 
payments are prearranged rather than waiting for the creditors to pursue him in court.  
 
Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(e) has very limited applicability in this case: 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt, which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
AG ¶ 20(e) applies in this case only to the debt in SOR 1.b, which was satisfied in 
September 2014 before the SOR was issued. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated some reform of his spending habits. He has not opened 
a credit card account since October 2007, and he has no active credit card accounts. The 
few accounts that were paid have been closed. His current monthly expenses are 
reasonable. He was about four months behind in his mortgage payment as of June 2013, 
but he has not been delinquent since he obtained a modification lowering his monthly 
payment. At the same time, Applicant has a substantial debt burden that is not likely to be 
resolved in the near future. As of January 2015, two writs of garnishment were pending 
 
 11 
execution. Yet, Applicant did not know which creditors had attached his wages. The 
concerns about his financial judgment are not sufficiently mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and 
all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative 
process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at 
the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) 
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
  
The financial analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. 
Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant 
additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a longtime defense contractor employee with a good work record. He 
earned the trust of his supervisors and co-workers for his sound judgment on the job and 
his dedication. However positive his contributions at work, they do not mitigate or extenuate 
years of personal financial irresponsibility. 
 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases, stating: 
 
[A]n applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid 
off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his 
financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The 
Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s 
plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and 
realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered 
in reaching a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan 
(and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at 
a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
 
 12 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation marks 
omitted). Under Appeal Board precedent, Applicant is not necessarily required to accord priority 
to debts in the SOR over other debts. However, waiting for his creditors to pursue him is not a 
credible substitute for a demonstrated record of good-faith payments. 
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security 
clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9
th
 Cir. 1990.). For the reasons 
noted above, based on the facts before me and the adjudicative guidelines that I am 
required to consider, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility at this time. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:  Against Applicant 
   Subparagraph 1.f:  Against Applicant 
   Subparagraph 1.g:  Against Applicant 
   Subparagraph 1.h:  Against Applicant 
   Subparagraph 1.i:  Against Applicant 
   Subparagraph 1.j:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
