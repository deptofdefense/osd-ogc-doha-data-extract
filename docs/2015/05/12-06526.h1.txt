GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 2, 2012, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On June 20, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility - Division A (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective

 Item 2 ((SF 86), dated January 2, 2012). 
 
2 
                                      
 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. In a statement, notarized August 19, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a 
hearing.2 A complete copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was 
provided to Applicant on March 19, 2015, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a 
period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in 
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished 
a copy of the Directive as well as the Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant 
received the FORM on April 2, 2015. He submitted a response to the FORM, with 
attachments, on April 7, 2015. The case was assigned to me on May 4, 2015.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but two of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c., 1.e., 1.g., and 
1.h.). Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving in an unspecified position with his current employer since November 2014.3 He 
was previously unemployed from April 2009 until June 2009, and again from March 
2014 until November 2014.4 Applicant received a bachelor’s degree in computer 
science in May 1989, and a master’s degree in an unspecified discipline in September 
2011.5 He served on active duty with the U.S. Navy from July 1979 until he was 
honorably retired as a lieutenant commander in August 1999.6 Applicant was awarded 
the Meritorious Service Medal upon his retirement.7 He was granted a secret security 
clearance in January 2007, but such clearance was apparently terminated in December

2012.8 Applicant was married in May 1979.9 He and his wife have three children: two 
sons (born in 1981 and 1985) and a daughter (born in 1993).10 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant’s spouse purchased a residence overseas for $104,000 in October 
2001, and in January 2012, it had an estimated value of $297,000.11 In addition to the 
residence in which he and his family currently reside, Applicant owns another residence 
in another state. He contends he is upside down on the mortgages for both properties, 
and they cannot be sold for any kind of profit.12  
 
In April 2009, because of a reduction in business contracts due to the 
deteriorating national economy, Applicant was laid off from his position as the vice 
president of operations and principal engineer of the company owned by Applicant’s 
father, for which Applicant had worked since September 2000.13 The company went out 
of business.14 Applicant’s wife worked for the same employer, and she too was laid 
off.15 While Applicant was able to find employment in June 2009, his wife was unable to 
do so until October 2011.16 Applicant was unable to maintain his monthly payments, 
resulting in some of his accounts becoming delinquent and placed for collection.  His 
primary residence at that time was lost to foreclosure.17  
 
Applicant contends that, in August 2009, he entered into a plan with a debt 
consolidation company in an effort to resolve his delinquent debts. The plan was to 
“dispatch” his personal debt by May 2014, and then concentrate on all other personal 
and “co-maker debts” that were currently outstanding.18 He failed to submit any 
documentation to support his contentions that he had entered into a debt consolidation 
plan, that the plan had established certain specific priorities, that certain identifiable 
personal debts had been resolved by May 2014, that any payments had been made to 
any of his creditors, or that certain identifiable co-maker debts were being paid. 
Applicant subsequently indicated that his plans were delayed when he was again laid

off in March 2014. Although Applicant regained his employment in November 2014, he 
did not offer any explanations regarding his temporary inability to continue or resume 
his debt repayment efforts. He claimed he had been in contact with most of his creditors 
in an effort to negotiate payment terms and amounts, but aside from letters to four 
creditors, all dated April 5, 2015,19 there is no documentation in the case file to indicate 
any efforts by him between June 2009 and March 2014, and from November 2014 to 
April 2015. 
 
Other than Applicant’s reference to a debt consolidation company, there is no 
evidence to indicate that Applicant ever received financial counseling. It is not known 
what Applicant’s financial resources may be because he did not submit a personal 
financial statement to indicate his net monthly income, his monthly household or debt 
expenses, or whether or not he has any funds remaining at the end of each month for 
discretionary use or savings. Applicant offered no evidence to indicate that his financial 
problems are now under control. 
 
The SOR identified eight purportedly continuing delinquent debts totaling 
approximately $403,798 that had been placed for collection or charged off, as reflected 
by a January 5, 2012 credit report;20 a March 19, 2014 credit report;21 and a February 
25, 2015 credit report.22  
 
Applicant denied being the primary signatory or co-maker on two of the identified 
SOR-accounts and contended he had filed disputes with the credit reporting services to 
have them removed from his credit reports.23 As to one bank credit card account (SOR 
¶ 1.d.), the account had a credit limit of $5,000 and Applicant was reflected as the 
individual with whom the account was opened in 2008.24 An unspecified amount was 
charged off in 2010, and the account was sold to an identified debt purchaser.25 That 
debt purchaser reported the past-due balance as $6,275 in 2012.26 The balance was 
increased to $8,896 in 2014,27 and as of February 2015, it had increased to $9,862.28 
The other credit card account (SOR ¶ 1.f.), opened in 1995, had an unspecified high 
credit, a past-due balance of $20,560, and a remaining balance of $36,091 when it was

charged off in 2009.29 Applicant failed to submit any documentation such as dispute 
correspondence to or from Applicant, the creditors, or the credit reporting agencies, to 
support his contentions regarding his purported disputes.  
 
The remaining accounts are supposedly at the point where negotiations with the 
creditors have commenced or will soon commence following verbal discussions with 
those creditors.30 Applicant claimed that the accounts are in his new plan to clean up his 
current credit history,31 but he offered no documentation to support his contention of a 
plan or any positive action with the creditors other than his recently drafted letters of 
April 2015. There is an unspecified type of account, characterized by Applicant as a line 
of credit,32 with a bank (SOR ¶ 1.a.) with a high credit of $6,348 and a past-due balance 
of $7,068 that was sold to a debt purchaser in 2011.33 The balance increased to $7,909 
in 2014,34 and as of February 2015, it had increased to $8,256.35 There is a bank credit 
card account, characterized by Applicant as a line of credit,36 opened in 2007 with a 
high credit of $6,390 and a past-due balance of $7,989 when it was charged off (SOR ¶ 
1.b.).37 There is a credit card account, characterized by Applicant as a line of credit,38 
opened in 2001 with a high credit of $2,069 and a past-due balance of $163 when it was 
charged off in 2009 (SOR ¶ 1.e.).39 There is another credit card account, characterized 
by Applicant as a line of credit,40 opened in 2006 with a high credit of $103,705 and a 
past-due balance of $116,613 when it was charged off (SOR ¶ 1.g.).41 
 
There is also a student loan account for Applicant’s son with an unspecified 
balance that became delinquent and was charged off in the amount of $853 (SOR ¶ 
1.c.).42 Although the SOR alleged the remaining loan balance was approximately

$155,181, Applicant disputed that amount,43 and there is nothing in the case file to 
support that segment of the allegation. Applicant offered no documentation to support 
his contention that the remaining balance was being reported in error, or that he 
disputed the amount with the credit reporting services. Applicant noted that his son is 
gainfully employed, and if he cannot reach a resolution with the creditor, Applicant will 
negotiate with the creditor and his debt consolidation company.44 
  
When Applicant’s former primary residence was lost to foreclosure, he still had a 
second mortgage that had been issued in 2007 in the amount of $66,000. The account 
was over 180 days past due, and by 2012, the balance had increased to $70,146 (SOR 
¶ 1.h.).45 The account was eventually transferred or sold to an unspecified collection 
agent or debt purchaser.46 Applicant initially stated that the creditor and the first 
mortgage lender were attempting to resolve the issue,47 but he failed to submit any 
documentation to support the existence of continuing issues between the two mortgage 
lenders, and he failed to address the allegation in his Answer to the SOR. In his recent 
letter to the second mortgage lender, Applicant offered to make monthly payments of 
$150 until the $70,146 debt is fully paid off.48 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”49 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”50   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating

conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”51 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.52  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”53 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”54 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
                                                          
51
 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a “history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant has had a long-standing problem with his finances which 
started as early as 2009. He found himself with insufficient funds to continue making his 
routine monthly payments and various accounts became delinquent, and were placed 
for collection.  One residence was foreclosed. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
    
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”55 In addition, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply if “the individual has a reasonable 
                                                          
55
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
 
9 
                                      
 
basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem 
and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do not apply. AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. 
The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties since 
about 2009 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so 
infrequent.” Applicant was previously unemployed from April 2009 until June 2009, and 
again from March 2014 until November 2014. While the loss of his salary during the first 
brief period of unemployment would be expected to have some financial impact on him, 
it appears that he was still receiving his military retirement. What did not occur between 
June 2009 and March 2014 is difficult to understand.  
 
Applicant offered no evidence of a good-faith effort to resolve any of his debts 
and essentially ignored them until relatively recently. He failed to submit any 
documentation such as receipts, cancelled checks, account records, etc., to support his 
contentions that any of his delinquent accounts were either resolved or that repayment 
arrangements had been agreed to. Likewise, there is the absence of documentation 
regarding possible debt consolidation, disputes, or any contacts with his creditors before 
April 2015. 
  
Other than Applicant’s comments regarding his debt consolidation company, 
there is no evidence to indicate that Applicant ever received financial counseling. It is 
not known what Applicant’s financial resources may be, or if he has any funds 
remaining at the end of each month for discretionary use or savings. There is no 
evidence to reflect that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. Applicant has 
not acted responsibly by failing to address his delinquent accounts and by making little, 
if any, efforts of working with his creditors.56 Applicant’s actions under the 
circumstances confronting him cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and

However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.58   
     
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He is a well-
educated individual who was honorably retired from the U.S. Navy as a lieutenant 
commander. He was previously unemployed from April 2009 until June 2009, and again 
from March 2014 until November 2014. He has declared his intention of cleaning up his 
credit and maintaining a good credit history.  
  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Other than Applicant’s superficial self-characterization as to his character, integrity, 
reliability, and judgment,59 there is no evidence from third-parties as to his reputation for 
reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant’s long-standing failure to repay 
creditors between 2009 and 2014, even in the smallest amounts, or to arrange payment 
plans, reflects traits which raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. 
It is not known what Applicant’s financial resources may be, or if he has any funds 
remaining at the end of each month for discretionary use or savings. Thus, there are no 
indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. Applicant has simply 
made the assertions that he contacted his creditors, arranged for a debt consolidation, 
and made efforts to resolve his personal debt by May 2014, and then concentrate on all 
other personal and “co-maker debts.” In the absence of documentation to support his 
assertions, little weight can be given to those assertions. Applicant’s actions under the 
circumstances confronting him cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and

good judgment. Considering the relative absence of confirmed debt resolution and 
elimination efforts, Applicant’s financial issues are likely to remain. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:60 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of ‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.’ However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has ‘. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.’ The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (‘Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.’) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated an essentially negative track record of debt 
reduction and elimination efforts, generally ignoring his debts.  Overall, the evidence 
leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a 
security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate 
the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through 
AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
