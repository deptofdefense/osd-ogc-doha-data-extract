Decision

HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges he failed to file his federal and 
state income taxes from 2010 through 2012. In 2013, before he received the SOR, he 
filed his tax returns and paid his taxes, which amounted to about ten percent of the 
amounts withheld from his salary. Financial considerations concerns are mitigated. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 3, 2013, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of security clearance application (SF 86).  
(GE 1) On November 21, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006. 
   
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(HE 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or

continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) 
 
On December 5, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) On February 9, 
2015, Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On March 2, 2015, DOHA 
assigned the case to me. On April 13, 2015, DOHA issued a notice of the hearing, 
setting the hearing for May 14, 2015. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. 
Department Counsel offered three exhibits into evidence, and Applicant offered nine 
exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 13-16; GE 1-3; AE A-I) There were no objections, and I 
admitted all proffered exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 13, 16; GE 1-3; AE A-I) On May 22, 
2015, I received the transcript of the hearing.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. 
Applicant also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions 
are accepted as findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is 32-year-old employee of a Defense contractor, who provides network 
engineer services. (Tr. 29; GE 1) He has access to his company’s sensitive information. 
(Tr. 29) There are no allegations of security violations. Applicant graduated from high 
school and then attended college for three semesters, where he majored in computer 
science. (Tr. 19-20) After college, Applicant worked for a retail home improvement store 
for five years; for four years at several information technology companies; and for five 
years for his current employer. (Tr. 20-27)   
 
In May 2013, he married. (Tr. 46; GE 1) He has never served in the military. (Tr. 
55; GE 1) He does not have any children. (Tr. 55) There is no evidence of alcohol 
abuse, use of illegal drugs, or criminal offenses aside from his failure to timely file his 
tax returns.   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant lives within his means and does not have any delinquent debts. (Tr. 40) 
He has a history of financial responsibility. (Tr. 40-42) 
 
When Applicant completed his April 3, 2013 SF 86, he disclosed that he had not 
filed his tax returns from 2010 to 2012. (Tr. 30; GE 1) His 2012 tax return was not due to 
be filed until April 15, 2013. (Tr. 31) Applicant explained why he did not timely file his tax 
returns. Applicant was focused on work; he was “working extremely hard” for his 
employer (60-80 hours a week); and he failed to take care of his personal matters, such 
as filing his tax returns. (Tr. 31, 48-49)

Applicant may have filed two tax returns late before 2010. (Tr. 51-52) Applicant’s 
2010, 2011, and 2012 federal and state tax returns were filed on August 20, 2013, using 
a commercial tax return preparation company. (Tr. 48; AE A, B, C) His 2010 through 
2012 tax returns contained the following information:

Applicant’s federal tax debts for 2010 through 2012, and on August 29, 2012, Applicant 
paid $442 resolving his state tax debt for 2011. (Tr. 33-37, 44-46; AE D, I) He filed and 
paid his 2013 and 2014 taxes when required. (Tr. 38-39) Applicant sincerely regrets his 
late filing of his tax returns from 2010 through 2012. (Tr. 39) He emphasized that he will 
timely file future state and federal tax returns and pay his taxes as required. (Tr. 50, 55) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
Two colleagues and friends and Applicant’s spouse lauded his dedication, 
honesty, trustworthiness, and reliability. (AE F-H) Their statements support approval of 
his access to classified information. (AE F-H)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.

  AG ¶ 19 provides one disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case, “(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns as required.” Applicant’s failure to timely file his 2010 through 2012 
federal and state tax returns is documented in his SF 86, SOR response, and hearing 
record. Title 26 U.S.C. § 7203 provides: 
 
Willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax.  
 
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or 
required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to 
make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully 
fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such 
records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law or 
regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty 
of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more 
than $25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not 
more than 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. 
 
Applicant’s income for 2010 to 2012 was well above the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
threshold for requiring a tax payer to file a tax return. In 2012, for example, the threshold 
for requiring filing of a tax return for a head of household under age 65 was $13,050. 
See IRS website, http://www.efile.com/tax/do-i-need-to-file-a-tax-return/. The 
Government established the disqualifying condition in AG ¶ 19(g) requiring additional 
inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and 
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
 AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. For the period 2010 to 2012, his federal 
taxes due totaled $37,354; federal taxes withheld totaled $33,387; net federal taxes due 
totaled $3,584; state taxes due totaled $13,067; state taxes withheld totaled $13,332; 
and he received a net $265 state tax refund. Applicant admitted responsibility for and 
took reasonable actions to resolve his tax issues. In 2013, he filed and paid the federal 
taxes for 2010 to 2012 before he received the SOR. He expressed sincere remorse and 
assured he will timely file and pay his federal and state taxes in the future. Based on his 
credible and sincere promise to timely file his tax returns, such conduct “is unlikely to 
recur and does not cast doubt on [Applicant’s] current reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment,” and “there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control.” His filing and payment of his taxes showed good faith. His efforts are 
sufficient to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  
  
 
 
                                                                                                                                            
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is 32 years old, and he is working for a Defense contractor providing 
network engineer services. He has access to his company’s sensitive information. 
There are no allegations of security violations. There is no evidence of alcohol abuse, 
use of illegal drugs, or criminal offenses aside from his failure to timely file his tax 
returns. Applicant understands what he needs to do to establish and maintain his 
financial responsibility. His filing of his tax returns and payment of his taxes for 2010 to 
2012 was not timely and showed bad judgment; however, his corrective action in 2013 
showed good faith. His maintenance of his other accounts in current status established 
a “meaningful track record” of debt payment. I am confident he will continue to pay his 
debts, timely file and pay his taxes, and maintain his financial responsibility. 
    
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial considerations security 
concerns are mitigated.   
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
