GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 6, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On May 30, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial

Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on June 24, 2014. In an undated (and not notarized) 
statement, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have his case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.2 A complete copy of the Government’s 
file of relevant material (FORM) was initially provided to Applicant on March 3, 2015, 
and resent on or after April 13, 2015,3 and he was afforded an opportunity, within a 
period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in 
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant received the FORM on April 23, 2015. A 
response was due by May 23, 2015. On an unspecified date before April 28, 2015, 
Applicant submitted his response with attachments.4 The case was assigned to me on 
May 15, 2015.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d., 1.f., and 1.g.). 
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I 
make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as a trainer in an overseas location with his current employer since February 
2011.5 He was previously employed by other federal contractors in overseas locations 
since June 2009.6 A 2001 high school graduate, Applicant attended university courses 
for several months in 2012, but he did not obtain a degree.7 He enlisted in the U.S. 
Army in May 2003 and served on active duty, primarily overseas, until June 2009, when 
he was honorably discharged. At the time of his discharge he held the rank of staff

 Item 1 (Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, undated).

 The initial FORM was received by Applicant’s facility security officer (FSO) on March 9, 2015, and was 
forwarded to Applicant at his overseas duty location on March 10, 2015. As of April 7, 2015, Applicant had still not 
received the FORM. On April 7, 2015, the FSO notified the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) of the 
situation and requested that another copy of the FORM be sent to the FSO. The new copy was furnished on or after 
April 13, 2015. See e-mails, dated April 7, 2015, and April 13, 2015, found in the case file.

 Applicant’s Response to the FORM was received by DOHA on April 28, 2015, as indicated by date-stamp 
on the reverse of the documents.

sergeant.8 Applicant was granted a secret security clearance in 2003.9 He was married 
the first time in October 2004, and divorced in September 2010; and married the second 
time in April 2011.10  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2010 when he 
was working in Afghanistan and his first wife took money out of his bank account and 
maximized a credit card account just prior to their divorce.11 As a result of a combination 
of factors, including his first wife’s actions, his divorce, his location in Afghanistan, and 
his current wife’s unspecified medical issues, Applicant had insufficient money to 
maintain his monthly payments. As a result, various accounts became delinquent and 
were placed for collection, or charged off. After becoming aware of the delinquent status 
of some of his accounts, Applicant cashed out his 401(k) retirement account and 
contacted his creditors in an effort to resolve his delinquent accounts.12 
The SOR identified seven delinquent debts that had been placed for collection or 
charged off, as reflected by a February 2015 credit report.13 Those seven debts total 
approximately $28,661. Those allegations and their respective current status, according 
to the credit report, other evidence submitted by the Government and Applicant, and 
Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below. 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): There is a bank checking account, not listed in Applicant’s 2015 
credit report, that Applicant listed in his e-QIP as having an estimated balance of 
$880,14 and the SOR alleged a balance of $907. Applicant disputed the amount alleged 
in the SOR.15 Applicant had switched bank accounts, and a deposit was sent to another 
bank and not to the creditor in April 2011.16 He made a final payment of $785.25 in July 
2014, and as of July 14, 2014, the account was considered by the creditor as paid in 
full.17 The account has been resolved.

(SOR ¶ 1.b.): There is a credit union automobile loan with a balance of $13,009 
that became delinquent in November 2010 and was eventually charged off.18 In his e-
QIP, Applicant commented that he had switched jobs and without realizing it, the 
account became one month past due. Upon relocating to Afghanistan, he resumed his 
monthly payments.19 He made up the delinquency by paying $1,500, but learned that 
the vehicle had already been repossessed in Korea. Neither Applicant nor the creditor 
was aware of the repossession until a representative of the credit union acknowledged 
the status of the vehicle eight months later.20 Applicant contacted the creditor to set up a 
repayment plan and also disputed the account with the credit reporting agency, but he 
described the account as “a hard account to work with,” because the paperwork keeps 
being bounced from one person to another.21There is no evidence that the vehicle was 
sold at auction or that Applicant was credited with any reduction in the balance due to 
the sale of the vehicle. The account has not been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): There is an education account with the U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs (referred to in the SOR as the Veterans Administration) in the amount 
of $815 that was considered an overpayment when a scheduled school class was 
canceled.22 He made a payment of $815.95 in July 2014, and as of July 15, 2014, the 
account was considered by the creditor as paid in full.23 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): There is another education account with the U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs (again referred to in the SOR as the Veterans Administration) in the 
amount of $1,413 that was considered an overpayment when a scheduled school class 
was canceled.24 The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) applied $1,430.60 of his income 
tax refund in September 2014, and as of September 19, 2014, the account was 
considered by the creditor as paid in full.25 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): There is a bank credit card account with a credit limit of $5,000 and 
a reported remaining balance of $5,218 although $4,651 was charged off.26 Applicant 
contended he made two payments each of $2,500 and one payment of $218 in

November and December 2010 to an identified collection agent.27 He repeatedly 
disputed the status of the account, but no correction has been made.28 He also noted 
that he furnished his documentation to the “security clearance interviewer,” presumably 
someone from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).29 Since the account 
was previously charged off and transferred or sold to another collection agent, and that 
agent received the amount due, the account has not been separately reported in 
Applicant’s February 2015 credit report. The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): There is a bank credit card account with a credit limit of $500 and a 
high credit of $1,333 that was charged off in the amount of $1,333 and transferred or 
sold to a debt buyer.30 The account became delinquent when Applicant’s first wife ran 
up the balance before their divorce.31 Applicant contended he paid off the account in 
full.32 The account is reported in Applicant’s February 2015 credit report as having a 
zero balance.33 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): There is a Military Star credit card account with a balance of $4,900 
that purportedly became delinquent in the amount of $5,966.34 The IRS applied 
$4,954.66 of his income tax refund in September 2014, and as of February 2015, the 
account balance was reflected in Applicant’s credit report as zero.35 The account has 
been resolved. 
Applicant’s February 2015 credit report reflects no other delinquent debts. He 
has committed himself to not missing any payments on his accounts and contends the 
financial problems that occurred during his divorce will never recur.36 Applicant’s 
financial problems appear to be under control.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”37 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”38   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”39 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.40  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”41 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”42 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems initially arose in 2010 and continued 
for several years thereafter. Accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection 
or charged off. One vehicle was repossessed. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.

The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”43 Under AG ¶ 20(e) it is potentially mitigating if “the individual has a 
reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the 
problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) apply. Applicant’s financial problems 
were not caused by his frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend 
beyond his means. Instead, those financial problems were largely beyond his control. 
They arose in 2010, when he was working in Afghanistan and his first wife took money 
out of his bank account and maximized a credit card account just prior to their divorce. 
Because of her actions,  the divorce, his location in Afghanistan, and his current wife’s 
unspecified medical issues, Applicant had insufficient money to maintain his monthly 
payments. As a result, various accounts became delinquent and placed for collection, or 
charged off.  
 
Upon becoming aware of the delinquent status of some of his accounts, 
Applicant cashed out his 401(k) retirement account and contacted his creditors in an 
effort to resolve his delinquent accounts. Of Appellant’s seven SOR-related accounts, 
six have been resolved. The remaining account has not yet been resolved, although 
Applicant has repeatedly attempted to acquire the necessary information regarding his 
                                                          
43
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

repossessed vehicle.44 Furthermore, the evidence appears to support Applicant’s 
disputes related to account balances and status. There are clear indications that 
Applicant’s financial problems are under control. His actions do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.45 
 
Security clearance adjudications are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The 
adjudicative guidelines do not require an applicant to establish resolution of each and 
every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve 
financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no 
requirement that an applicant immediately resolve or make payments on all delinquent 
debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in an SOR be 
paid first. Rather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the 
payment of such debts one at a time.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.46

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant failed 
to insure that his regular monthly payments to creditors were made in a timely manner. 
As a result, accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection. One vehicle 
was repossessed. 
 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant is an Army veteran with an honorable discharge. As a member of the military 
or as a government contractor, he has served in Korea and Afghanistan. Applicant’s 
financial problems were not caused by his frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he 
did not spend beyond his means. Rather, they were largely beyond his control. They 
arose in 2010, when he was working in Afghanistan and were caused by his first wife 
just prior to their divorce. They continued because of her actions, the divorce, his 
oversea location, and his current wife’s medical issues. The entire situation occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. There are clear indications that 
Applicant’s financial problems are under control. 
  
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.
