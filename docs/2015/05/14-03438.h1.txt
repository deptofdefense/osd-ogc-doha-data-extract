Decision
______________
HENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:
Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I conclude that
Applicant’s eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and signed an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations
Processing (e-QIP) on February 17, 2013. The Department of Defense (DOD)
Consolidated Adjudications Facility, (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)
detailing the trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, on
November 21, 2014. The action was taken under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as
amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines For Determining Eligibility for
Access to Classified Information (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006.

Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 4, 2014. He answered
the SOR in writing in an undated response, and he requested a hearing before an
administrative judge with the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).
Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 7, 2015, and I received the
case assignment on February 23, 2015.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 4,
2015, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 25, 2015. The Government
offered three exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were received, marked, and admitted into
evidence without objection. Applicant and his personal representative testified. Applicant
submitted eight exhibits (AE) A through H, which were received, marked, and admitted
into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on
April 2, 2015. I held the record open until April 15, 2015, for the submission of additional
matters. Applicant timely submitted AE I through AE GG, which were received, marked,
and admitted without objection. The record closed on April 15, 2015.
Procedural Rulings
Notice
Applicant received the notice of the date, time and place of the hearing less than
15 days before the hearing. I advised Applicant of his right under ¶ E3.1.8. of the
Directive to receive the notice at least 15 days before the hearing. Applicant
affirmatively waived this right under the Directive. (Tr. 9-10)
Findings of Fact
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the
SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional information to support his request
for eligibility for a public trust position.  
Applicant, who is 54 years old, works as a manager for a DOD contractor. He
began his current position in March 2013. His duties require him to provide complex
case management services in health care. Applicant has received pay raises and
favorable reviews from his employer.1
Applicant enlisted in the United States Navy in 1979 at the age of 20. He worked
as an electrician’s mate in the Navy. He received an honorable discharge from the Navy
in May 1989, when he left to care for his ill father. After caring for his father, Applicant
enrolled in nursing school and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing in May
1994. He has worked as a floor nurse and in nursing management for more than 20
years.2

Applicant married his first wife in 1979, and they divorced in 1983. Applicant and
his current wife married in 1996. Applicant has two stepsons, ages 30 and 28.
Applicant’s wife holds a nursing degree and a master’s degree in business
administration. She also works in nursing management.3
Applicant worked as a staff nurse until October 2004. He left this position on
October 2004 to work as a clinical director, a position he held until his position was
eliminated in November 2007. He was unemployed from November 2007 until April
2008, when he accepted a management position in nursing home care. He voluntarily
left this position in August 2008. Applicant was again unemployed until December 2008.
From December 2008 until August 2011, Applicant worked as a clinical transplant
coordinator. In August 2011, he accepted another nursing position at a speciality
hospital, where he worked until February 2013, when he left for his current position.
From January 2006 until February 2012, Applicant worked part time as an adjunct
professor at a local college.4
When Applicant was laid off in 2007, he earned $92,000 a year. His next position
paid $55,600 a year. He earned $60,000 as a transport coordinator and $68,000 a year
at the speciality hospital. His starting salary at his current position was $75,000 a year,
and his current annual salary is $91,000. Applicant did not accept or receive
unemployment either time he was unemployed. His salary as an adjunct professor
ranged between $11,800 and $20,000 a year. His earnings differed each year.  5
Applicant and his wife worked for the same medical facility. After his job was
eliminated, his wife continued to work for the medical facility until January 2009, when
her position was eliminated. At this time, she earned approximately $98,000. She was
unemployed for three months in early 2009. She accepted a new position paying
$75,000 a year. She currently earns $105,000 a year. Applicant’s wife also worked as
an adjunct professor at a local college at the same time Applicant did, earning between
$19,000 and $26,000 a year, except in 2012 when she earned $5,154.6
In April 2011, Applicant experienced a flare-up of his rheumatoid arthritis when
the infusion medicines stopped working. After four months on leave under the Family
and Medical Leave Act, he resigned from his job in August 2011. During this time, he
received disability income. He believed that his disability income was paid at the rate of
50% of his total income.7

Applicant requested a copy of his tax returns or tax transcripts for the tax years
2007 through 2013 from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS advised that it
does not provide a tax transcript for more than three years back.  Applicant provided a8
copy of his 2014 federal tax return and transcripts for the tax years 2011, 2012, and
2013.  Applicant obtained a copy of the IRS wage and income transcripts of his and his9
wife’s earnings for the tax years 2007 through 2014. The wage and income transcripts
provide information about all sources of income for Applicant and his wife. The sources
of income include gross wages, interest, retirement distributions, state tax refunds, sale
of stock, cancellation of debt, life insurance, and investments. The following table will
show their income from wages, interest, and state tax refunds separately from the total
income for each year:  10
Wages/Interest/Tax Refund Total Income
2007 $211,335 $211,335
2008 $185,428 $191,678
2009 $225,857 $233,797
2010 $201,969 $237,422
2011 $178,232 $182,357
2012 $168,963 $206,877
2013 $168,594 $267,380
2014 $178,089 $211,980
The IRS documents reflect that Applicant or his wife received retirement
distributions in the amount of $6,250 in 2008, of $7,940 in 2009, of $26,524 in 2010, of
$1,246 in 2011, of $23,809 in 2012, of $7,400 in 2013, and of $30,204 in 2014.  While11
this income information was forwarded to the IRS, it is unknown if this income treated as
taxable income, used for living expenses, used for debt payment, or placed elsewhere
because it is retirement funds. In 2013, Applicant received $30,856 from an investment
distribution, and his wife received $60,530 in life insurance.  Again, the use of this12
income is unknown. Applicant and his wife received cancellation of debt income 1099-C
forms in 2011 for $1,962, in 2012 for $1,442 and $18,009, and in 2014 for $9,421.13
The credit reports of record indicate that Applicant and his wife paid their bills
until the summer of 2011 when they became overwhelmed by their debts. In June 2011,

they contacted a debt resolution company to help them manage their debts. This debt
resolution company identified approximately $100,000 in credit card debt and offered to
help them resolve their debts. They signed an agreement with the debt resolution
company. In July 2011, they began paying the servicing company for the debt resolution
company $1,235 a month and made timely payments every month until April 2014,
when the debt resolution company ceased operations. The servicing company for the
debt resolution company managed their account until October 2014. At that time, the
servicing company mailed them a small refund check.14
The SOR identified six purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by
February 2013 and April 2014 credit reports, totaling approximately $94,766. In his
efforts to resolve these debts, Applicant learned that some accounts have been
transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. He pursued
payment of the debts with the new holders of the debts. Accounts have been changed
and otherwise hard to identify because only partial account numbers are shown, in
some instances eliminating the last four digits and in others eliminating other digits.
SOR allegation 1.a concerns a credit card debt to a bank for $22,852. Applicant
provided the debt resolution company information about this debt. The creditor refused
to work with the debt resolution company. In 2011, Applicant spoke with the creditor
independently, and the creditor refused to negotiate a settlement. This debt remains
unresolved.  15
SOR allegations 1.b ($22,712) and 1.d ($13,895) concern two credit cards with
the same creditor. The creditor sold both debts to debt collectors. Through the debt
resolution company, Applicant settled the larger debt with the collection creditor for
$14,100. The settlement terms required an initial payment of $2,000, which was made
in August 2012, and monthly payments of $450 until paid. Applicant provided
documentation indicating that of 28 the required payments, 25 were made through the
debt resolution company by September 2014. He made the last payment on this debt in
December 2014. The creditor has not yet provided verification, advising Applicant that it
takes about six months to provide the notification. The smaller debt has been paid as
shown by the March 2015 credit reports. The March 2015 Experian credit report shows
nine payments totaling $4,475 to the creditor through the debt resolution company. The
creditor provided Applicant with a 1099-C form for the remaining balance of $9,421.
Applicant included the unpaid and forgiven debt balance as income on his 2014 federal
income tax return.16

The $20,645 debt in SOR allegation 1.c relates to a credit card. The creditor
provided Applicant with a 1099-C cancellation of debt form for $18,009 in 2012.
Applicant claimed this amount as income for taxes in 2012. This debt is resolved.17
SOR allegation 1.e ($11,711) relates to another credit card debt. Applicant had
his checking accounts and an equity line of credit with this creditor. He spoke with the
creditor on two separate occasions about resolving this debt since he continued to
conduct his banking needs with it. The creditor refused to discuss a settlement of the
debt and has not issued a 1099-C form. This debt remains unpaid.  18
The last SOR allegation 1.f ($2,951) concerns a furniture store account.
Applicant paid this debt, as shown by the March 2015 credit reports. The March 2015
Experian credit report shows eight payments totaling $2,100 to the creditor through the
debt resolution company. This debt is resolved.  19
Applicant and his wife advised that when their income declined, they used their
credit cards to pay for food, clothing, school books for a son, some vacation, and travel
to care for her ill parents who lived about 700 miles away. The debt resolution company
worked with them on budgeting and credit counseling. Applicant and his wife prepared a
budget for the debt resolution company in 2011. Their net monthly income totaled
approximately $8,900 and their monthly expenses totaled approximately $7,466. They
indicated that they were timely on their mortgage payment. Between July 2011 and April
2014, Applicant and his wife paid the debt resolution company approximately $42,750.
On their behalf, the debt resolution company made payments totaling $21,704 to five
creditors. While the creditors paid are identified, some of these creditors are not the
original holders of the debts. Payments to three creditors relate directly to the SOR
debts as previously discussed. The payments to two remaining creditors have not been
connected to SOR debts.   20
Applicant recently received a pay raise. He earns $7,039 in gross income, and he
receives $4,135 a month in net income. Applicant’s wife earns $8,243 a month in gross
income, and she receives $5,042 a month in net income. Their total net monthly
household income is $9,177. For their federal and state tax withholding amounts,
Applicant claims zero exemptions as a single person, and his wife claims zero
exemptions as a married person. The record lacks any evidence that they have unpaid
taxes.21
GE 2, GE 3; AE A - AE C; AE I.22

Applicant also provided an updated budget. They indicate that their net income is
$9,177. They listed their housing and transportation expenses at $5,250. They pay $850
on credit cards, $300 on student loans, and $1,200 on food. Multiple miscellaneous
expenses include pet food, personal care, gifts, and some savings. Since these
expenses are variable, Applicant has sufficient income to pay his usual and customary
monthly living expenses. The credit reports of record reflect that Applicant and his wife
pay or paid many debts in a timely manner and in full. The six debts in the SOR are the
only unpaid debts identified in the credit reports.22
Policies
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”
(See Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  “The standard that must be met for
. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the
person’s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” (See
Regulation ¶ C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence
and Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness
adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service
and Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are
afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final
unfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.)  
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the
adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair,
impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a
conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.”
The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b)
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to
[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The
8
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness
decision. 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it
grants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or
safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of
sensitive information.
 
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations
is set out in AG & 18:  
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate
funds. 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.
Under AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ and under AG & 19(c),
Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise trustworthiness concerns.
Similarly, AG ¶ 19(e) “consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be
indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-
income ratio, and/or other financial analysis” may also raise trustworthiness concerns.
Applicant and his wife incurred high levels of debt despite a high income. They were
unable to pay all their bills, which resulted in unpaid debts. These disqualifying
conditions are applicable.
The Financial Considerations guideline also includes examples of conditions that
can mitigate trustworthiness concerns. I have considered mitigating factors AG ¶ 20(a)
through ¶ 20(f), and the following are potentially applicable:
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast
doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
9
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control; and
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or
otherwise resolve debts.
Applicant’s loss of his job in late 2007 began a slow, steady decline in wages in
his household. The combined income of Applicant and his wife is still lower today than
their income in 2007. Part of this income decline is directly related to the fact that they
no longer work part time as associate professors at a local college. By 2011, they were
unable to mange their monthly bills and sought help. Since then, they have worked to
improve their finances. The loss of control over their finances occurred four years ago
and is the only time in their marriage they incurred financial issues. AG ¶ 20(a) has
some applicability because, except for this period of time, Applicant has managed his
finances. 
Between November 2007 and March 2009, Applicant or his wife were
unemployed for a total time of one year. They returned to work at jobs paying
substantially less income than their prior jobs. In 2011, Applicant received only 50% of
his salary because he was on disability for health problems. These are circumstances
beyond their control. Until 2011, Applicant and his wife continued with efforts to pay
their bills. Eventually, they sought help by hiring a debt resolution company. They
complied with the terms of their agreement with the debt resolution company until it
ceased operations in April 2014. They continued payments to the creditor in SOR
allegation 1.b as negotiated when the servicing company ceased making further
payments on their behalf. They acted reasonably under the circumstances. AG ¶ 20(b)
applies.
Applicant and his wife received debt counseling through the debt resolution
company. They developed a realistic budget and have sufficient income to pay their
living expenses, their mortgage, their car payments, their student loans, and their credit
cards. They have resolved four SOR debts through negotiated settlements or receipt of
1099-C forms to include the forgiven debt as taxable income. They attempted to work
with the creditors holding the two remaining debts, but the creditors refused to work with
them or their representative, the debt resolution company. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply.
Whole-Person Concept
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the
10
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
“(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and
other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.” 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public
trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The decision to grant or
deny a trustworthiness determination requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors,
both favorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the
evidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a trustworthiness
concern is established and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position should not be made as punishment for
specific past conduct, but on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of
record to decide if a nexus exists between established facts and a legitimate
trustworthiness concern.
In assessing whether an Applicant has established mitigation under Guideline F,
the Appeal Board provided the following guidance in ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3
(App. Bd. May 21, 2008):
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” See, e.g., ISCR Case
No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). However, an applicant is not
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and
every debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2
(App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant
demonstrate that he has “. . . established a plan to resolve his financial
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” See, e.g.,
ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). The Judge can
reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and
his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the
reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about the person, past
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching
a determination.”) There is no requirement that a plan provide for
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable
plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such
debts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd.
11
Apr. 4, 2008). Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually
paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the
SOR.
The evidence in support of granting a trustworthiness determination to Applicant
under the whole-person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of
denial. In reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating
conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant
and his wife earn a substantial income and have for many years. When each lost their
jobs in 2007 and 2009, they continued to pay their debts. While their monthly earnings
declined and remain lower now than their earnings in 2007, the IRS wage and earnings
transcripts reflect other sources of income. Some of this income came from forgiven
debt. This money would not be available to pay bills, only to eliminate a monthly
payment. The varying amounts of retirement money may have been household income,
but that is unclear from the evidence in the record. Applicant and his wife received two
large income payments in 2013, resulting in higher income and taxes. All of this
information reflects that Applicant and his wife had a high level of income. They also
had high expenses. Their credit reports reflect that they paid all their expenses until
2011.
When they encountered difficulty paying all their bills, Applicant and his wife
sought assistance in 2011. The debt resolution company sought to resolve many of their
credit cards debts. To do so, they stopped paying on specific bills. With the assistance
of the debt resolution company, they paid three SOR debts plus two other non-SOR
debts. Although the creditor in SOR allegation 1.c refused to work with the debt
resolution company, this creditor issued a 1099-C for debt forgiveness. While they did
not have to pay the debt, they had to include the debt as income on their tax returns and
pay the resulting taxes. Despite their independent efforts, two creditors refused to work
with their debt resolution company or with them to resolve their debts. Applicant cannot
force these companies to resolve these debts. After reviewing all the evidence of
record, Applicant has shown a track record for payment of many debts on time, and he
has shown a track record for resolution of the debts identified in the SOR. He and his
wife took control of their runaway finances in 2011 and have worked steadily to reduce
their debts. They have been unable to resolve all their debts because the creditors
refused to work with them.  Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are
paid: it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a
public trust position. While some debts remain unpaid, they are insufficient to raise
trustworthiness concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).) 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a position of trust. For all these reasons, I
conclude Applicant mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his finances
under Guideline F.

Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.b: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.c: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.d: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.e: For Applicant
Subparagraph 1.f: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a
position of trust.  Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.
