GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations and 
personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information 
is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 25, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On August 21, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility – Division A (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the DOD on September

1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and 
E (Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators could not make 
an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 4, 2014. In a sworn 
statement, dated September 23, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On November 6, 2014, Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to 
me on November 14, 2014. A Notice of Hearing was issued on December 2, 2014. I 
convened the hearing, as scheduled, on December 17, 2014. 
 
 During the hearing, six Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 6) and eight 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE H) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on January 5, 2015. I 
kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it, but he chose not to do so. 
The record closed on December 30, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted three of the factual allegations in 
the SOR under financial considerations (¶¶ 1.b., 1.f., and 1.g.). He failed to address the 
personal conduct allegation (¶ 2.a.). Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and 
upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as a logistics specialist since January 2013.2 He also went through periods of 
unemployment from May 2003 until October 2003 (because his employer had lost the 
contract on which Applicant was working) and from May 2009 until August 2009 (while 
Applicant was competing in mixed martial arts fights and sparing matches).3 A May 
1987 high school graduate,4 Applicant attended a community college for several years, 
but did not earn a degree.5 He was granted a secret security clearance in either 1998 or 
1999,6 but the status of that security clearance is not known. Applicant has never

served with the Unitary States military.7 Applicant was married in July 1990 and 
divorced in August 1991.8  
 
Financial Considerations 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until August 2005. From 
about 1998 until 2005, Applicant’s accountant routinely filed his personal tax returns 
under his power of attorney authority. Applicant owned a local business – a sole 
proprietorship – from March 2003 until August 2005, and his accountant also did his 
business payroll. One day in late August 2005, while Applicant was in another state, a 
catastrophic event occurred that significantly altered his life: Hurricane Katrina struck. 
The storm was so destructive that President Bush declared both a major disaster and a 
state of emergency in the state in which Applicant had his residence and business. 
Applicant’s business was destroyed and documentation was lost. His accountant’s 
building was destroyed, and her business was temporarily closed, but it subsequently 
reopened.9 She assisted him in wrapping up the final financial details of his business.10  
Applicant presumed his accountant had routinely filed his tax returns and never 
questioned her about the issue. Applicant failed to timely file his tax returns for three 
reasons: 1. he still believed his accountant was doing so, 2. he was still overwhelmed 
with other hurricane-related priorities such as providing for his family, shelter, and 
keeping his job, and 3. oversight.11 In 2013, after he unsuccessfully attempted to 
contact her, he hired another accountant, and learned that his first accountant had not 
filed his tax returns for several years.12 The new accountant filed the missing returns for 
him. Applicant also personally filed his most recent income tax return.  
In addition to his unfiled federal income tax returns for the tax years 2006, 2007, 
and 2009, with an unspecified liability, the SOR identified six purportedly continuing 
delinquencies as reflected by credit reports from May 201313 and June 2014,14 totaling 
approximately $76,631. Those debts listed in the SOR and their respective current 
status, according to the credit report, other evidence in the case file, and Applicant’s 
admissions regarding the same, are described below.

(SOR ¶ 1.a.): There were federal income tax returns for the tax years 2006, 
2007, and 2009 that were not timely filed. The tax returns for the two earlier years were 
filed on February 21, 2013 – three months before Applicant was interviewed by an 
investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).15 For the tax year 
2006, because of a tax overpayment, Applicant would have been entitled to a refund of 
$1,185, but because the tax return was filed more than three years after it was due, the 
refund claim was disallowed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).16 For the tax year 
2007, because of another tax overpayment, Applicant would have been entitled to a 
refund of $562, but, once again, because the tax return was filed more than three years 
after it was due, the refund claim was disallowed by the IRS.17 For the tax year 2009, 
because of another tax overpayment, Applicant would have been entitled to an 
unspecified refund, but because the tax return would have been filed more than three 
years after it was due, the IRS stated that Applicant was no longer bound to file his tax 
return and he was no longer eligible for the refund.18 The tax return filing issues have 
been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): There is a federal tax lien in the amount of $42,179.79 covering the 
tax periods of 2006, 2007, and 2008.19 When Applicant’s business was destroyed and 
closed, the proper paperwork was submitted to the state authorities, but the information 
was not forwarded to the IRS. As a result, the IRS treated the business as a continuing 
enterprise and taxes and interest kept accumulating.20 Once Applicant found out about 
the lien, he called the IRS and the error was corrected.21 The entire tax lien was 
released on October 1, 2014.22 The issue has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): There is a home mortgage loan on Applicant’s primary residence 
with a high credit of $48,750 that went into foreclosure in February 2009.23 Applicant 
owed the mortgage holder $23,279 at the time of foreclosure.24 The house was 
purchased at auction by the highest bidder for $25,471.76,25 an amount which 
exceeded Applicant’s responsibility. There is no deficiency balance.26 Applicant

eventually repurchased the residence, and does not have a mortgage. He spent 
$42,000 rebuilding the residence for his grandmother who resides in the house.27 The 
account has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): There is a home mortgage loan on Applicant’s rental property that 
he built in 2001 or 2002 with a high credit of $60,000 that went into foreclosure in 
February 2010.28 Applicant owed the mortgage holder approximately $50,000 at the 
time of foreclosure.29 The house was purchased by the highest bidder, the mortgage 
holder, for $59,428.25,30 an amount which exceeded Applicant’s responsibility. The 
residence was subsequently resold to another purchaser for $95,000.31 Applicant has 
spoken to the mortgage holder on several occasions, and they have told him there is a 
zero balance, but they refuse to put the facts in written form without his sending them 
his social security by facsimile or going to a local bank branch to prove who he is.32 
Applicant is reluctant to put his social security number on a facsimile, and he noted that 
the closest local bank branch for the mortgage holder is 300 miles away.33 It is unlikely 
that a deficiency balance remains. Applicant has submitted some documentation to 
support his contentions, and it appears that the matter has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): There is a gas utility account with a past-due balance of $100 that 
was placed for collection and charged off in 2010.34 Applicant had previously converted 
the residence to electric and cancelled the gas account, and was not aware that the 
account was delinquent until he tried to reconnect the gas for his grandmother.35 
Applicant paid the entire amount on July 11, 2014, over a month before the SOR was 
issued.36 The account has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): There is a telephone account with a past-due balance of $420 that 
was placed for collection in 2010.37 The account was subsequently transferred or sold to 
another collection agent who increased the unpaid balance to $433.83.38 Applicant was

not aware that the account was delinquent until he was interviewed by the OPM 
investigator.39 It took him several months to track down the actual creditor and collection 
agent, and once he was successful, he paid the entire bill on December 8, 2014.40 The 
account has been resolved.

account was delinquent until he was interviewed by the OPM investigator.43 It took him 
some time to track down the actual creditor and collection agent, and he paid the entire 
bill on December 8, 2014.44 The account has been resolved. 
 
When asked about his financial priorities with regard to his delinquent debts, 
Applicant stated that he prioritized by addressing the larger debts first and worked his 
way down to the lower balances.45 Applicant’s annual salary has increased since he 
started working for his current employer, and he now earns about $75,000 per year.46 
He had no credit cards, no auto or school loans, and doesn’t borrow money.47 Applicant 
uses an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of his expenses, and estimates that he has a 
monthly remainder of $4,000.48 He has never had financial counseling.49  
 
Personal Conduct

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security

emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”50 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”51   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”52 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.53  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4,

possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”54 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”55 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. In addition, a “failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax 
returns as required. . .” may raise security concerns under AG ¶ 19(g). Applicant failed 
to timely file his federal income tax returns for 2006, 2007, and 2009. He lost two 
houses to foreclosure, and three accounts became delinquent. A federal tax lien was 
filed against him and various accounts were placed for collection or charged off. AG ¶¶ 
19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition

may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”56  
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. Applicant’s financial problems were 
not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his 
means. Instead, as noted above, Applicant’s initial significant financial problems started 
when Hurricane Katrina struck and destroyed his business.  For a substantial period 
thereafter, he was overwhelmed with hurricane-related priorities such as providing for 
his family, shelter, and keeping his job, as well as simple oversight on his part. With his 
business destroyed, Applicant attempted to save his two remaining important financial 
assets – his primary residence and his rental property – but he was unable to do so. 
When both properties were lost in foreclosure, there were no deficiency balances. He 
repurchased the primary residence for his grandmother and pumped $42,000 into it. 
Unknown to him at the time, Applicant had three accounts with relatively minor balances 
that were delinquent and placed for collection. Once he learned of their existence, and 
located the proper creditors, he paid those accounts in full. The federal tax lien was the 
unfortunate result of miscommunication between the state and the IRS which led to the 
IRS treating Applicant’s destroyed business as a continuing enterprise. Once Applicant 
found out about the lien, he called the IRS and the error was corrected. The entire tax 
lien was released on October 1, 2014. 
As for the delinquent income tax filings, as noted above, Applicant was under the 
impression that his accountant had filed them. He eventually found out that she had not 
done so, and he turned to another accountant to do so. The tax returns for 2006 and 
2007 were filed three months before Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from 
                                                          
56
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

OPM. Because those tax returns were filed beyond the three-year filing period, 
Applicant forfeited the refunds of $1,185 and $562 to which he would have been entitled 
had the returns been timely filed. Applicant would have also been entitled to an 
unspecified refund for the tax year 2009, but the IRS stated that Applicant was no 
longer bound to file his tax return and he was no longer eligible for the refund.  
Applicant has never received counseling from a financial counselor. 
Nevertheless, all of Applicant’s newer accounts are current. He has no credit cards, no 
auto or school loans, and doesn’t borrow money. Applicant uses an Excel spreadsheet 
to keep track of his expenses, and estimates that he has a monthly remainder of 
$4,000. Applicant prioritized his purportedly delinquent accounts by addressing the 
larger debts first and worked his way down to the lower balances. There are clear 
indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions 
under the circumstances confronting him, do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.57 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG & 15:       
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
 The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 16(d), it is potentially disqualifying if there is 
 
credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other 
guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, 
but which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-
person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not 
properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited 
to consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. . . .  
 
Under AG ¶ 16(e), it is also potentially disqualifying if there is 
personal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, that 
creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . .

engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person’s personal, 
professional, or community standing. . . . 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for 2006, 2007, and 2009. 
AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(e) have been established. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from personal conduct. AG ¶ 17(c) may apply if “the offense is so 
minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened 
under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, AG ¶ 17(e) may 
apply if “the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to 
exploitation, manipulation, or duress.”  
AG ¶¶ 17(c) and 17(e) apply. In late August 2005, an extraordinarily unique 
circumstance, Hurricane Katrina, struck.  Devastation was everywhere. President Bush 
declared both a major disaster and a state of emergency. Applicant’s business was 
destroyed and documentation was lost. His accountant’s building was destroyed, and 
her business was temporarily closed. For a substantial period thereafter, he was 
overwhelmed with hurricane-related priorities such as providing for his family, shelter, 
and keeping his job. Because his accountant had previously routinely prepared and filed 
his income tax returns under a power of attorney, Applicant presumed she had routinely 
continued to do so and he never questioned her about the issue. Unfortunately, she 
failed to perform as Applicant had expected, and the income tax returns were not filed. 
In 2013, after he unsuccessfully attempted to contact her, he went to another 
accountant and discovered the truth. He filed or attempted to file those tax returns only 
to learn that he was no longer eligible for the refunds to which he would have been 
eligible had the tax returns been timely filed. With the pressures created by the 
hurricane’s impact on Applicant now subsiding with time, Applicant has taken positive 
steps to eliminate or avoid similar circumstances. He now personally files his income tax 
returns. 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant failed to 
timely file federal income tax returns for 2006, 2007, and 2009. He lost his primary 
residence and a rental property to foreclosure. He incurred a federal tax lien and had 
several accounts become delinquent and placed for collection. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial than 
the disqualifying evidence. Applicant’s initial significant problems erupted when 
Hurricane Katrina struck and destroyed his business. For a substantial period thereafter, 
he was overwhelmed with hurricane-related priorities such as providing for his family, 
shelter, and keeping his job, as well as simple oversight on his part. With his business 
destroyed, Applicant attempted to save his two remaining important financial assets, but 
he was unable to do so. Unknown to him at the time, Applicant had three accounts with 
relatively minor balances that were delinquent and placed for collection. Once he 
learned of their existence, and located the proper creditors, he paid those accounts in 
full. The federal tax lien was the unfortunate result of miscommunication between the 
state and the IRS which led to the IRS treating Applicant’s destroyed business as a 
continuing enterprise. Once Applicant found out about the lien, he called the IRS and the 
error was corrected. The entire tax lien was released. The failure to file his income tax 
returns was, in no small measure, due to his reliance on his previous professional 
relationship with his accountant and reliance on her filing the returns under his power of 
attorney. When he found out she had not filed them as he thought she had, Applicant 
turned to another accountant. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial 
problems and associated personal conduct are under control. His actions under the 
circumstances do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:58 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available,

reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts.  While he failed to timely file his federal income tax returns, his 
explanations for those failures, in light of the continuing circumstances following the 
hurricane, are credible. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without substantial 
questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising 
from his financial considerations and personal conduct. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 
2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   For APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:    For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a:    For Applicant 
     
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
