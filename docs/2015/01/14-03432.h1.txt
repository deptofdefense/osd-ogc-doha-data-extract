Decision 
______________ 
 
 
TUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has mitigated security concerns pertaining to Guideline F (financial 
considerations). Clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 18, 2013, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86). On 
August 13, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated 
February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 
2005. 
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations).  The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for 
 
2 
 
 
Applicant, and it recommended that her case be submitted to an administrative judge 
for a determination whether her clearance should be continued or revoked.  
 
On September 15, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR. On October 9, 2014, 
Department Counsel was ready to proceed on Applicant’s case. On October 17, 2014, 
DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to me. On October 20, 2014, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a hearing notice, setting the hearing for 
November 4, 2014. Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, 
Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were 
received into evidence without objection. Applicant did not call any witnesses, testified, 
and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were received into evidence 
without objection.  
 
 I held the record open until November 14, 2014, to afford Applicant the 
opportunity to submit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted AE E through 
L, which were received into evidence without objection. On November 13, 2014, 
DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.).  
  
Findings of Fact 
 
In her SOR answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 
1.k, and 1.m. She denied SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.g, 1.l, 1.n, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, 1.r, and 1.s. After 
a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.  
 
Background Information 
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old badging clerk, who has been employed by a defense 
contractor since December 2013. She seeks a secret security clearance, which is a 
requirement of her continued employment. (GE 1, Tr. 22-23.)  
 
Applicant earned her GED in 1989. She was awarded an associate of science 
degree in paralegal studies in August 2008. (GE 1, Tr. 23-24.) Applicant was 
previously married from August 1990 to January 1995 and from January 1997 to 
August 2001. Her first two marriages ended by divorce. Applicant remarried a third 
time in February 2002. She has three adult daughters, none of whom are dependent 
on her for support. Applicant did not serve in the armed forces. (GE 1, Tr. 25-26.)  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s SOR contains 19 separate allegations consisting of 12 collection 
accounts, 5 past-due accounts, and 2 charged-off accounts. The vast majority of these 
debts are for student loans. The remaining debts are for relatively small balances for a 
credit card and uncovered medical co-pay bills. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.s.) 
 
 
3 
 
 
Applicant attributes her financial problems to two periods of unemployment 
from June 2010 to February 2011 and February 2013 to October 2013, and a 
December 2013 surgery. (GE 1, Tr. 26-27.) 
 
The following summarizes the status of each SOR debt:  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a – Charged-off student loan for $9,331. Applicant is making $179 
monthly payments and account is current. As of the hearing date, her loan balance 
had been reduced to $4,120. DEBT BEING RESOLVED. (SOR answer; GE 3, AE 
A(6), AE F, AE G, AE H; Tr. 28-32, 55, 57.) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.m are collection or charged-off 
student loan accounts in the respective amounts of $6,544, $6,152, $3,898, $3,836, 
$3,356, $2,919, $2,141, $1,462, and $1,119. Applicant consolidated these loans into 
one account and is making $108 monthly payments on that account. DEBT BEING 
RESOLVED.  (SOR answer; AE A(3), AE B, AE D, AE F, AE G, AE I; Tr. 33-37, 44-
50, 56.) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.g are collection accounts in the respective amounts of 
$6,451 and $3,573. Applicant consolidated these accounts into one account and is 
making $72 monthly payments on that account. DEBT BEING RESOLVED. (SOR 
answer; AE A(6), AE F, AE G; Tr. 38, 56.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.l is a charged-off student loan for $884. Applicant settled and paid this 
account for the lesser amount of $361 in September 2014. DEBT RESOLVED. (SOR 
answer; AE A(2), AE A(5), AE F, AE J; Tr. 34-36, 38, 54-55.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.n is a credit card past-due account for $135. Applicant has been 
making payments on this account since December 2013. The account has been 
rehabilitated and is in good standing. DEBT BEING RESOLVED. (SOR answer; AE 
A(4), AE F, AE K; Tr. 39, 55.) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.o is a collection account for $277. The account is listed as “closed” on 
Applicant’s January 2014 credit report. Department Counsel withdrew this allegation. 
DEBT RESOLVED. (SOR answer; GE 3, AE F; Tr. 39-40.) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.p – 1.s are delinquent medical co-pay accounts in the respective 
amounts of $75, $75, $75, and $20. Accounts paid in full. DEBTS RESOLVED. (SOR 
answer, AE L, Tr. 40-46.) 
 
Applicant and her husband’s net monthly income is $5,729. Applicant’s budget 
reflects that she is current on her monthly bills and lives within her means. Applicant’s 
monthly budget also reflects a net monthly remainder of $1,919. (Tr. 50-51, 59, 61-63, 
AE E.)

Character Evidence 
 
 Applicant provided her most recent work performance evaluations for 2013 and 
2014 documenting above-average performance. (AE A(7), AE A(8).) Applicant also 
submitted two work-related reference letters from her supervisor and a co-worker. 
Both individuals attested to her good character and noted her contribution as a 
defense contractor employee. Applicant’s employer fully supports her for a security 
clearance. (AE A(9), AE A(10).) 
 
                                                  Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible 
rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in 
this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
 
5 
 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the 
burden of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 
531.  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” 
See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The 
guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any 
of the criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should 
err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
                                                     Analysis 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
 AG ¶ 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is established by the evidence presented. The 
Government established disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c).   
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶¶ 20 are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
 
6 
 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the 
circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶ 20(a) because 
there is more than one delinquent debt and her financial problems are not isolated. 
Her debt is a “continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence. 
See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 
01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Nevertheless, she receives partial credit under 
AG ¶ 20(a) because the debts occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur 
and her behavior does not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment. 
 
Full application of AG ¶ 20(b) is warranted. Applicant’s two periods of 
unemployment and a surgery could not have been anticipated. She diligently sought 
reemployment and is doing her level best to pay her creditors. As noted supra, 
Applicant has paid or is resolving all of her debts and has made substantial progress 
in regaining financial responsibility.1  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(e) are not applicable. Applicant’s budget demonstrates that 
she living within her means. Having paid or is resolving the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
through 1.s, Applicant is able to receive full credit for those debts under AG ¶ 20(d). 
 
 
  
                                                          
1
“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 
(App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 
99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A 
component is whether she maintained contact with her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep her debts current. 
 
7 
 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should 
consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the 
motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, 
exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must 
be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis 
section under Guideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. However, 
further comments are warranted. 
Applicant’s employment with a defense contractor weighs heavily in her favor. 
She is a law-abiding citizen and a productive member of society. She is current on her 
day-to-day expenses, lives within her means, and her SOR debts have been resolved 
or are being resolved. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-
person analysis in financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating F cases, the Board has previously noted that the concept 
of “‘meaningful track record’” necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has “. . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” The 
Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s 
plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and 
realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. 
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for 
the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a 
 
8 
 
 
reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
 
Applicant’s debts have been paid or are being resolved. Due to circumstances 
beyond her control, her debts became delinquent. Despite her financial setback as a 
result of two periods of unemployment and a medical issue, it is clear from Applicant’s 
actions that she is on the road to a full financial recovery. These factors show 
responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.  
 
Both the mitigating conditions under Guideline F and the whole-person analysis 
support a favorable decision. I specifically considered Applicant’s years of financial 
responsibility before falling into debt, the circumstances that led to her financial 
difficulties, her financial recovery and steps she has taken to resolve her financial 
situation, her potential for future service as a defense contractor, the mature and 
responsible manner in which she dealt with his situation, her reference letters, and her 
testimony and demeanor. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, 
and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole-person, I conclude she 
has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative 
process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the 
SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.s:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility 
for a security clearance. Clearance is granted.
