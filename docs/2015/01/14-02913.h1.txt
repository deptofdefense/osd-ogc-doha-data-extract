GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations and 
personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information 
is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 14, 2003, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire (EPSQ) version of a security clearance 
application.1 On June 27, 2007, he submitted a Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive 
Positions (SF 85).2 On February 1, 2013, he submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security clearance application.3 On July 
24, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility – 
Division A (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order

10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); 
and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified 
Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other 
determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR 
alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E 
(Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on August 13, 2014. In a sworn statement, dated 
August 15, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations,4 but failed to indicate 
whether or not he wished to have a hearing. By a separate letter, also dated August 15, 
2014, he elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.5 It 
is unclear if Department Counsel requested a hearing pursuant to Directive ¶ E3.1.7., or 
if Applicant changed his mind, for the record is silent and that request for a decision on 
the written record was never addressed during the hearing.6 Department Counsel 
indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on November 6, 2014. The case 
was assigned to me on November 14, 2014. A Notice of Hearing was issued on 
December 2, 2014, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 18, 2014. 
 
 During the hearing, seven Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 7) and ten 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE J) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant and one other witness testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on January 
6, 2015. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took 
advantage of that opportunity. He submitted additional documents which were marked 
as AE K and AE L and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on 
January 14, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations and personal conduct (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.f., and 
2.a. and 2.b.). Applicant’s answers are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:

 Both parties were asked if there were any unresolved procedural matters to take up before getting into the 
evidence, and they both responded with a “no.” See Tr. at 10.

Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
the same employer in different geographic locations since September 2007.7 A June 
1982 high school graduate,8 in September 2002, Applicant received an associate’s 
degree in applied science,9 and he is currently enrolled with an online university working 
towards another degree.10 He has held a secret security clearance since 1983.11 
Applicant was married in June 1988, separated in November 2010, and divorced in May 
2013.12 They have two sons (born in 1991 and 1995).13 
 
Military Service 
 
Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in August 1983, and he served on active 
duty until he retired honorably as a master sergeant (E7) in December 2006. During his 
military service, he was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal (with one device), the 
Air Force Commendation Medal (with two devices), the Air Force Outstanding Unit 
Award (with seven devices), the Air Force Good Conduct Medal (with six devices), the 
National Defense Service Medal (with one device), the Global War on Terrorism Service 
Medal, the Air Force Long Overseas Ribbon (with three devices), the Air Force 
Longevity Service Ribbon (with four devices), the USAF NCO PME Graduate Ribbon 
(with two devices), the Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon (Rifle), and the Air 
Force Training Ribbon.14 
 
Financial Considerations 
In June 2008, Applicant suffered a major stroke that caused him to be 
hospitalized for one or two weeks and with three months in rehabilitation with physical 
therapy and occupational therapy relearning to walk, talk, and get his vision back to 
normal.15 While he still experiences some physical results of the stroke, his cognitive 
abilities are essentially normal.16 His medical expenses were satisfied by his health 
insurance from his employer and TRICARE, but he was placed on short-term disability

by his employer and only received 65 percent of his normal pay during that period.17 
Nevertheless, Applicant was still able to make his normal monthly payments.  
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about November 
2010. When he and his wife separated, he was current on his accounts and was 
routinely paying the normal family bills including home mortgage, rent, and his wife’s 
automobile insurance. Applicant had hoped to engage in a simple dissolution of 
marriage, but that was not to be for the property settlement negotiations turned rather 
nasty when his wife told Applicant she was going to take him for every cent she could.18 
Things became so contentious that he was forced to spend approximately $16,000 on 
attorney’s fees protecting his financial assets.19 The divorce decree resulted in Applicant 
taking a financial bath.  
Applicant’s wife retained 100 percent of the net proceeds from the sale of the 
family home; she retained the newer vehicle, but assumed the remaining debt on it; she 
retained the proceeds in Applicant’s Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), his 401(k) account 
(approximately $40,000), a mutual fund, and several Individual Retirement 
Arrangements (IRAs); she retained the proceeds from their joint checking account, and 
the marital portion of Applicant’s military retirement.20 Applicant was ordered to continue 
paying for his wife’s mortgage, child support, and a number of credit card accounts.21 
The parties were ordered to jointly file federal income tax returns for the tax years 2011 
and 2012. In addition, Applicant was to provide his wife all the documentation, such as 
W2s and 1099s so she could have the forms completed and filed by a specific tax 
preparation service.22  
There came a point during the general period of separation and divorce when 
Applicant simply did not have sufficient funds to keep up with his expected monthly 
payments. Some accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection or 
charged off. Because the financial arrangements had not yet been finalized before the 
actual property settlement, there was also some hesitancy on Applicant’s part as to 
which accounts he was responsible for paying. In an effort to reduce his expenditures, 
Applicant moved in with a friend, and while he does not pay any rent, he does pay $700 
a month for the utilities and cable.23 In April 2014, approximately 11 months after the 
divorce, Applicant filed a Voluntary Petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S.

Bankruptcy Code.24 He listed approximately $223,438 in liabilities, including a mortgage 
for $172,113, and approximately $51,325 in unsecured nonpriority claims.25 As of 
September 11, 2014, Applicant had paid the bankruptcy trustee $5,500 to be disbursed 
to approved claimants.26 During the period October 2014 through December 2014, he 
paid an additional $6,000,27 bringing the total paid to the trustee to $11,500.28 On 
November 7, 2014, the plan was confirmed by the bankruptcy judge, and she ordered 
payments to claimants.29 Disbursements commenced on November 25, 2014, and it is 
anticipated that they will continue at the rate of $2,000 per month until August 2016.30 
Applicant went to the family services center to obtain financial counseling. With 
the assistance of the financial counselor, he prepared a personal financial profile, 
including an action plan.31 A review of that document reveals a total monthly net income 
of approximately $3,428; and routine monthly living expenses, including bankruptcy 
payments, of approximately $2,213; leaving approximately $1,215 available for 
discretionary spending or savings.32   
The SOR identified five delinquent debts that had been placed for collection or 
charged off, as reflected by a February 2013 credit report33 and a March 2014 credit 
report.34 There is also an allegation that Applicant had failed to file his federal income 
tax return for the tax year 2011, but no unpaid balance is indicated. Those five debts, 
totaling approximately $51,499, and their respective current status, as well as the 
income tax issue, according to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by the 
Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described 
below. 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): There is a bank line of credit with a credit limit of $10,300 and a 
remaining balance of $9,792 that was 180 days or more past due.35 The account was

opened to assist Applicant’s mother-in-law to move across country to reside with 
Applicant and his wife.36 The account was current until Applicant vacated the marital 
home, but because of the additional expenses associated with the separation, he simply 
ran out of money to deal with the account.37 The court subsequently ordered Applicant 
to be responsible for the account.38 The account was included in his bankruptcy petition 
as an unscheduled nonpriority claim,39 and the first disbursement in the amount of 
$1,757.23 was made on November 25, 2014.40 The account is in the process of being 
resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): There is a credit card that Applicant had with his 21-year-old son 
(as an authorized user) with a credit limit of $12,000 and a remaining balance of $1,794 
that was placed for collection and eventually charged off.41 Applicant used the card for 
about $3,500 in medical bills for his son,42 and his son increased the balance by 
purchasing vast amounts of clothing and other unspecified items.43 When he realized 
what his son had done, Applicant took the card away from him.44 Applicant’s son never 
offered to reimburse him for those charges.45  Applicant continued to make the monthly 
payments for about six months until he could no longer afford to do so.46 The account 
was included in his bankruptcy petition as an unscheduled nonpriority claim,47 and the 
first disbursement in the amount of $2,021.38 was made on November 25, 2014.48 The 
account is in the process of being resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): There is a credit card with a credit limit of $8,700 and a remaining 
balance of $7,375 that was $583 past due for over 60 days when it was placed for 
collection.49 The account was current until Applicant vacated the marital home, but 
because of the additional expenses associated with the separation, he simply ran out of

money to continue making his monthly payments. At some point, the creditor started 
garnishment proceedings, and Applicant’s military retirement served as the source of 
the payments.50 Because the account was included in his bankruptcy petition as an 
unscheduled nonpriority claim,51 the garnishments ceased,52 and the first disbursement 
in the amount of $835.50 was made on November 25, 2014.53 The account is in the 
process of being resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): There is a credit card with a credit limit of $9,500 and a remaining 
balance of $10,079 that was $772 past due for over 60 days when it was placed for 
collection.54 The account was current until Applicant vacated the marital home, but 
because of the additional expenses associated with the separation, he simply ran out of 
money to continue making his monthly payments. The court subsequently ordered 
Applicant to be responsible for the account.55 The account was included in his 
bankruptcy petition as an unscheduled nonpriority claim,56 and the first disbursement in 
the amount of $1,819.82 was made on November 25, 2014.57 The account is in the 
process of being resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): There is a credit card with a credit limit of $12,854 that was $1,566 
past due for over 150 days when it was placed for collection and eventually charged 
off.58 The account was current until Applicant vacated the marital home, but because of 
the additional expenses associated with the separation, he simply ran out of money to 
continue making his monthly payments. The court subsequently ordered Applicant to be 
responsible for the account.59 The account was included in his bankruptcy petition as an 
unscheduled nonpriority claim,60 but because the creditor failed to timely submit a 
required Proof of Claim, the delinquency was discharged.61 The account has been 
resolved.

(SOR ¶ 1.f.): Applicant’s 2011 federal income tax return was not filed until 2013. 
As noted above, the divorce court ordered the parties to jointly file for the tax years 
2011 and 2012. Applicant was to provide his wife all the documentation, such as W2s 
and 1099s so she could have the forms completed and filed by a specific tax 
preparation service. Applicant did not discover that his wife had not timely filed the 
return for 2011 until 2013 when the tax preparation service submitted documentation for 
his signature for both tax years 2011 and 2012.62 Applicant was due refunds for both 
2011 and 2012, and under the property settlement, he was to have received 50 percent 
of the refunds, but his ex-wife never forwarded his share to him.63 He timely filed his 
return for the tax year 2013.64 There is no evidence of any continuing penalty because 
of the late 2011 filing, and the matter appears to have been resolved. 
Personal Conduct 
 
 (SOR ¶ 2.a.): On February 1, 2013, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he 
responded to questions pertaining to his financial record. One question in Section 26 –
Financial Record – Taxes asked if, in the past seven years, he had failed to file or pay 
federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance. Applicant answered 
“no” to the question. He certified that the response was “true, complete, and correct” to 
the best of his knowledge and belief, but the response to that question was, in fact, false 
for Applicant’s 2011 federal income tax return was not filed until 2013.  He subsequently 
explained that he only learned of his ex-wife’s failure to timely file the tax return when 
the tax preparation service submitted documentation for his signature for both tax years 
2011 and 2012, and that information was not known to him when he completed the e-
QIP.65 In complying with the divorce court mandate, Applicant had provided his ex-wife 
all the documentation, such as W2s and 1099s, so she could have the forms completed 
and filed by a specific tax preparation service. He essentially complied with his 
obligations, but she had failed to complete her own obligations. While the late filing was 
technically his responsibility as well, his response to the inquiry in the absence of 
knowledge of her failure, did not constitute a knowing falsification by him. 
  
 (SOR ¶ 2.b.): Another question in Section 26 – Financial Record (Delinquency 
Involving Routine Accounts) asked if, in the last seven years, he had bills or debts 
turned over to a collection agency; been over 120 days delinquent on any debt not 
previously entered, and if he was currently over 120 days delinquent on any debt. 
Applicant answered “no” to those questions. He certified that the response was “true, 
complete, and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief, but the response to 
those questions was, in fact, false for at that  time Applicant had several accounts that 
were either placed for collection or were over 120 days delinquent. He subsequently 
explained that when he completed the e-QIP a final determination had not yet been

made by the divorce court as to which accounts he would be responsible.66 He denied 
intending to falsify his response, but conceded that upon reflection, he probably should 
have furnished a more thorough explanation.67  
 
Work Performance and Character References 
 Applicant’s supervisor, site lead, section chief, and co-worker characterized 
Applicant in highly favorable terms. Applicant is a hard working individual who 
consistently demonstrates skilled knowledge, outstanding work ethic, dedication to the 
job, thoroughness, consistency, positive attitude, honesty, openness, trustworthiness, 
professionalism, and integrity.68  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”69 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”70   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider

all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”71 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.72  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”73 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”74 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a “history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Also, “failure to file annual federal, state, or local income tax returns 
as required or the fraudulent filing of the same” is potentially disqualifying. Applicant’s 
most significant financial problems arose during the period of his 2010 separation and 
2013 divorce.  He was unable to continue making his routine monthly payments and 
various accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection or charged off. He 
failed to timely file his federal income tax return for 2011. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) 
apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”75  
                                                          
75
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
 
12 
                                      
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. Applicant’s financial problems were 
not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his 
means. Instead, as noted above, Applicant’s initial financial problems started in 
November 2010 when he and his wife separated and continued to May 2013 when they 
were finally divorced. Maintaining separate households was difficult for Applicant, and 
when the final divorce decree was issued, his finances were dramatically impacted 
when his wife was awarded a significant portion of the family assets, and he was made 
responsible for the family liabilities, including the cost of relocating his wife’s mother 
across country. Applicant was forced to prioritize his monthly payments because of an 
inability to make his normal payments. He reduced discretionary expenses, moved in 
with a friend to eliminate rent, took a credit card from his son, and attempted to continue 
paying his creditors to the best of his ability. Nevertheless, some accounts became 
delinquent and were placed for collection or charged off. In April 2014, he filed for 
bankruptcy under Chapter 13. As of December 2014, Applicant had paid the bankruptcy 
trustee $11,500 to be disbursed among his creditors. Applicant pays the trustee $2,000 
each month, and it is anticipated that by August 2016, his nonpriority, unsecured debts 
will be eliminated.  
As for the delinquent tax filing, as noted above, the divorce court ordered the 
parties to jointly file for the tax years 2011 and 2012. Applicant complied with the 
requirement that he provide his wife all the documentation, such as W2s and 1099s so 
she could have the forms completed and filed by a specific tax preparation service. It 
was Applicant’s ex-wife who failed to timely file the income tax return. Applicant did not 
discover that his wife had not done so until 2013 when the tax preparation service 
submitted documentation for his signature for both tax years 2011 and 2012. He timely 
filed his return for the tax year 2013. There is no evidence of any continuing penalty 
because of the late 2011 filing, and the matter appears to have been resolved. 
Applicant received counseling from a financial counselor, and the counselor 
assisted him in developing an action plan based on Applicant’s personal financial 
profile. Applicant now has approximately $1,215 available for discretionary spending or 
savings each month.  All of Applicant’s newer accounts are current. Four of Applicant’s 
SOR-related accounts are in the process of being resolved with monthly payment 
arrangements under the bankruptcy, and those payments are being routinely made 
through the bankruptcy trustee. The one remaining SOR-related account was 
discharged, not because of any lack of effort by Applicant, but rather by the refusal of 
the creditor to timely file a Proof of Claim. There are clear indications that Applicant’s 
financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating 
condition].

confronting him, do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.76 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG & 15:       
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
 The guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns. Under AG ¶ 
16(a), it is potentially disqualifying if there is 
a deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
 As noted above, on January 31, 2013, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he 
responded to certain questions pertaining to his financial record. The questions in 
Section 26 – Financial Record asked if, in the past seven years, he had failed to file or 
pay federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance; he had bills or 
debts turned over to a collection agency; been over 120 days delinquent on any debt 
not previously entered, and if he was currently over 120 days delinquent on any debt. 
Applicant answered “no” to those questions. He certified that the responses were “true, 
complete, and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief, but the responses to 
those questions were, in fact, false.  
 
 Applicant’s responses provide sufficient evidence to examine if his submissions 
were deliberate falsifications, as alleged in the SOR, or merely the result of 
misunderstanding of the true facts on his part. Applicant subsequently denied intending 
to falsify his responses and explained that he had simply answered the questions 
honestly at that time for he had no knowledge of his ex-wife’s failure to timely file the 
2011 income tax return and he was still awaiting the court decision as to what the final 
property settlement would be. Upon reflection, Applicant now concedes that he should 
have furnished a better explanation regarding the delinquent accounts, but he stands by 
his response pertaining to the tax filing.

 I have considered Applicant’s educational background and lengthy professional 
career, including his military career, in analyzing his actions. Applicant is an intelligent, 
talented, and experienced individual, and his explanation, under the circumstances, 
should be afforded some weight. His confusion and resultant actions are 
understandable and his position is reasonable. As it pertains to the alleged deliberate 
falsifications, Applicant’s credible explanation has refuted AG ¶ 16(a). In this instance, I 
conclude that Applicant’s actions do cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.77       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His handling of 
his finances permitted a number of accounts to become delinquent, placed for collection, 
or charged off.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant has an outstanding reputation in the military and in the workplace. Applicant’s 
financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did 
not spend beyond his means. Rather, his problems were caused by a combination of 
factors, including his major stroke in 2008, his separation in 2010, his divorce in 2013, 
his then-wife’s vow to take him for every cent she could, the divorce court’s awarding 
his wife a substantial portion of his financial assets and making Applicant responsible 
for most of the family debts, and his son’s misuse of a credit card, all of which were 
largely beyond Applicant’s control. Applicant has resolved, or is in the process of

Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

resolving, all of the accounts identified in the SOR through the Chapter 13 bankruptcy 
process. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under 
control. His actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 78 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations and personal conduct. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
