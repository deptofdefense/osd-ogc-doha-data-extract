GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 4, 2013, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (E-QIP).1  On July 22, 2014, 
the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility – Division A 
(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and Adjudicative Guidelines 
for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the 
Department of Defense on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other 
determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD 
adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is

clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant’s 
eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract with the Department 
of Defense, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether 
such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 1, 2014. In an undated 
written statement, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was 
prepared to proceed on September 29, 2014, and the case was assigned to me on 
October 14, 2014. A Notice of Hearing was issued on October 28, 2014, amended on 
October 31, 2014 to accommodate Applicant, scheduling the hearing for November 19, 
2014. I convened the hearing, as scheduled. 
 
 During the hearing, three Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 3) and six 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE F) were admitted into evidence, without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on December 2, 2014. I kept the 
record open to enable Applicant to supplement it, and she took advantage of that 
opportunity by submitting six additional exhibits (AE G through AE L) which were 
admitted into evidence, without objection. The record closed on December 3, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.b. through 1.p.) of the SOR. She denied the 
one remaining allegation (¶ 1.a.). 
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and she is seeking 
to retain her eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract with the 
Department of Defense. She has never served with the U.S. military.2 She is a 1986 
high school graduate with about three to five years of college credits, but no degree.3 
She was unemployed from December 2012 until February 2013.4 Applicant joined her 
current employer in February 2013, and serves as a customer service advocate.5 She 
was married in October 1999,6 and she has two daughters, born in 2001 and 2009.7

Financial Considerations 
 
It is unclear when Applicant initially started experiencing financial difficulties for 
she acknowledged she was already struggling financially in 2009.8 Her January 2013 
credit report reflects two accounts that were in collection in 2007.9 Applicant attributed 
her financial problems to a series of incidents and situations including the following: in 
2009, after a “very hard pregnancy,” she gave birth to a slightly premature daughter who 
had a small hole in her heart, requiring extra days of hospitalization and unanticipated 
increased costs; her husband was working for the state and, because of the terrible 
economy, there were hiring freezes and no raises in seven years; the housing market 
had crashed, causing her to spend additional money simply to remain in their residence; 
tubes were inserted in her daughter’s ears, again costing unanticipated expenditures; in 
August 2012, Applicant injured her back, necessitating back surgery in October 2012 
and again in December 2012; in May 2013, Applicant had surgery to fuse a neck 
vertebra; and because of the increased costs and financial problems, she was forced to 
short-sell their residence.10  
 
Applicant’s plan was and is to pay her outstanding debts as soon as she is 
financially able to do so.11 However, she was frustrated in doing so because none of the 
delinquent medical accounts listed in the SOR identify the actual medical provider, and 
when she has attempted to follow through with her efforts, various collection agents 
have refused to cooperate with her, furnish validation of a purportedly delinquent 
account, or identify the original creditor. Nevertheless, she contends she has been 
paying off approximately $8,000 in medical bills but has been unable to pay them all off 
at once.12 Applicant completed a personal financial statement in which she indicated a 
monthly family net income of approximately $3,075; monthly expenses, including debt 
payments, of approximately $3,010; leaving a net remainder of approximately $65 
available for discretionary spending or saving.13 The day before the hearing, Applicant’s 
family income improved substantially. Her husband received a promotion, and the 
current personal financial statement reflects a monthly family net income of 
approximately $4,617, leaving a new net remainder of approximately $1,607 available 
for discretionary spending or saving.14 In order to minimize family expenses, she, her 
husband, and children, moved into her parents’ residence.15 She no longer has any

credit cards.16 Except for the accounts listed in the SOR, Applicant has no other 
delinquent accounts.17  
 
The SOR identified 16 purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by credit 
reports from January 201318 and March 2014,19 totaling approximately $8,555. All but 
one of those accounts are medical debts. Some of the accounts listed in the credit 
reports have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection 
agents. None of the medical accounts in the credit reports, as well as in the SOR, reflect 
a creditor’s name. Applicant indicated she was disputing the majority of the accounts 
listed in her credit reports because she did not know the identity of the medical 
providers.20 She explained that each of the surgical procedures involved different 
unidentified specialists about whom she knew nothing. She also pledged to resolve her 
financial issues within the next six months.21 With her husband’s promotion and 
increased salary, she intends to pay her debts because she doesn’t want to see them 
and doesn’t “want to sit in a place like this [a courtroom] again.”22  Applicant eventually 
attempted to contact various creditors and collection agents but her efforts to obtain 
itemized statements and validation of the accounts was met with resistance because 
most of them refused to furnish her anything in writing until she paid the debts.23 The 
debts listed in the SOR and their respective current status, according to the credit 
reports, other evidence submitted by the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s 
comments regarding same, are described below. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): Applicant had a home mortgage account and an associated line of 
credit on a credit card. The residence was in a pre-foreclosure status when Applicant 
was able to sell it with a short sale, thereby resolving the delinquent mortgage. 
Applicant contends the line of credit, with an unpaid balance of $1,328, should have 
been resolved when the residence was sold.24 It apparently was not. The account was 
placed for collection in 2012, and subsequently sold to a debt purchaser.25 Applicant 
made no effort to resolve the account before the hearing,26 but after the hearing she 
contacted the debt purchaser and set up a partial repayment plan under which she

agreed to pay $664.45 on December 26, 2014.27 Applicant offered to make the 
remaining payment in January 2015, but the debt purchaser was unwilling to accept that 
offer and suggested she borrow the funds from her father to pay the debt off. It is 
Applicant’s intention to make that January payment before she addresses any of her 
delinquent medical accounts. The debt purchaser promised to furnish her with an 
acknowledgment 30 days after the account is paid in full.28 Applicant offered no 
documentation to support her contention that she made the initial payment. 
Nevertheless, the account appears to be in the process of being resolved. 
 
There are 11 medical accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.b. for $1,349, 1.c. for $422, 1.d. for 
$366, 1.e. for $289, 1.g. for $143, 1.h. for $90, 1.i. for $59, 1.k. for $246, 1.m. for $147, 
1.n. for $1,329, and 1.p. for $95) that were placed for collection.29 Applicant disputed 
these accounts because she did not know the identity of the medical providers. She 
finally identified three of the medical providers after one (SOR ¶ 1.k.) furnished her a 
statement of services for $246.48, and she intends to pay it.30 As for one of the other 
accounts (SOR ¶ 1.e.), once she receives the mailed statement of services for $289.94, 
she intends to pay that as well.31 She intends to pay the $94.58 balance of the other 
account (SOR ¶ 1.p.) in early February 2015. Other than those three accounts, 
Applicant has not made any payments on the remaining accounts, but intends to do so 
when she can identify who they are. Three of the accounts are in the process of being 
resolved, and the other eight accounts have not been resolved. 
 
There are 4 other medical accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.f. for $147, 1.j. for $53, 1.l. for 
$2,003, and 1.o. for $489) that were also placed for collection.32 In her Answer to the 
SOR, Applicant contended she was in the process of paying each of the above 
creditors,33 but failed to specify the terms of her repayment arrangements, and 
neglected to furnish documentation to support her contentions. She subsequently 
contacted a number of hospitals and doctors, specifically by name, but failed to identify 
to which of the SOR allegations the specific medical provider pertained. Several of the 
medical providers or collection agents agreed to return her calls but have not yet done 
so. Others indicated different balances than the ones alleged in the SOR.34 In the 
absence of supporting documentation, it is unclear if the accounts are in the process of 
being resolved.

In an attempt to save their residence when it was in a foreclosure status, 
Applicant and her husband engaged the services of an attorney and paid him $3,000.35 
She has never received financial counseling.36 
 
Character References 
 
 Applicant’s supervisor has also been a peer. She characterized Applicant in very 
favorable terms, noting that Applicant “is beyond honest and would rather suffer a 
negative consequence of any caliber than betray herself and the integrity that she 
values so much.” Her work is nearly flawless, and she is “so reliable.” Applicant has a 
positive, cheery, and infectious attitude.37 Other co-workers who also became close 
friends are equally supportive of Applicant. They refer to her as kind, trustworthy, 
honest, willing to go above and beyond, helpful, professional, loyal, compassionate, and 
dependable.38 Another of Applicant’s friends has known her for over 30 years. He noted 
that Applicant is honest, straightforward, hard-working, determined, and bright.39 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”40 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. Positions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as “sensitive 
positions.”41 “The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is 
that, based on all available information, the person’s loyalty, reliability, and 
trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security.”42 Department of Defense contractor 
personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any 
final unfavorable access determination may be made.43

When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a public trust 
position. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”44 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.45  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  
Furthermore, security clearance determinations, and by inference, public trust 
determinations, should err, if they must, on the side of denials.46 In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations 
is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. 
Under AG ¶ 19(a), “an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially 
disqualifying.  Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” 
may raise concerns. As noted above, Applicant has been struggling financially since 
about 2007, and while she may have recovered from some of those difficulties, she was 
beset by new and continuing financial issues in 2009. With insufficient funds to make 
her monthly payments, accounts were placed for collection. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) 
apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate 
trustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the 
disqualifying condition may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, 
was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.” Also, under AG ¶ 20(b), financial concerns may be mitigated where “the 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person has received or is receiving 
counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 
20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”47  
                                                          
47
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].  
 
9 
                                      
 
AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. The conditions 
that contributed to Applicant’s financial problems were as follows: in 2009, after a “very 
hard pregnancy,” she gave birth to a slightly premature daughter who had a small hole 
in her heart, requiring extra days of hospitalization and unanticipated increased costs; 
her husband was working for the state and, because of the terrible economy, there were 
hiring freezes and no raises in seven years; the housing market had crashed, causing 
Applicant to spend additional money simply to remain in their residence; tubes were 
inserted in her daughter’s ears, again costing unanticipated expenditures; in August 
2012, Applicant injured her back, necessitating back surgery in October 2012 and again 
in December 2012; in May 2013, Applicant had surgery to fuse a neck vertebra; and 
because of the increased costs and financial problems, she was forced to short-sale 
their residence.  
 
  Over the years, Applicant attempted to act aggressively, timely, and responsibly 
to resolve some of her delinquent debts, but because of the continuing financial 
situation she was facing, she was unable to address other delinquent debts.  Applicant’s 
plan was and is to pay her outstanding debts as soon as she is financially able to do so. 
However, she was frustrated in accomplishing her goal because none of the delinquent 
medical accounts listed in the SOR identify the actual medical provider, and when she 
has attempted to follow through with her efforts, various collection agents have refused 
to cooperate with her, furnish validation of a purportedly delinquent account, or identify 
the original creditor. In this regard, I am aware of the Appeal Board decision that it is 
“well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally meet the 
substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations” under ¶ E3.1.14 of the 
Directive for pertinent allegations.48 While the burden may shift to an applicant to 
establish either that he or she is not responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation 
apply, in this instance, because of the poor quality of the contents of the credit reports, 
and the absence of more specific information pertaining to the actual creditors in the 
SOR, I have concluded that Applicant has not been furnished with adequate notice to 
enable her to identify those creditors. The combination of insufficient information and 
the actions by various collection agents in refusing to furnish validation of the various 
debts has made her task that much more cumbersome. 
 
In order to minimize family expenses, Applicant, her husband, and children, 
moved into her parents’ residence. She no longer has any credit cards. She contends 
she has been paying off approximately $8,000 in medical bills but has been unable to 
pay them all off at once. As noted above, Applicant’s family income improved 
substantially the day before the hearing when her husband was promoted. The current 
personal financial statement reflects a new net remainder of approximately $1,607 
available for discretionary spending or saving. Except for the accounts listed in the 
SOR, Applicant has no other delinquent accounts.

There is one shortcoming in Applicant’s presentation, and it is that she offered 
little documentary evidence to support her contentions that she has paid off 
approximately $8,000 in medical bills. While that might reflect an absence of evidence 
by an applicant, in this instance, considering the nature of the delinquent debts (all but 
one are medical accounts), and her reputation for honesty, integrity, and 
trustworthiness, I have credited Applicant with efforts to resolve both non-SOR debts 
and SOR debts. With increased family income, her goal of resolving her delinquent 
debts appears to be within reach. While Applicant has not received financial counseling, 
it appears that she is at the precipice of a more aggressive repayment agenda. She has 
not ignored her debts and to the degree possible, Applicant has act responsibly under 
the circumstances.49  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public 
trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. She has been 
struggling financially since 2007. While she claims to have taken steps to resolve a 
number of delinquent non-SOR accounts, most of her efforts, while described by 
Applicant, have not been supported by documentary evidence such as receipts, 
cancelled checks, or written acknowledgments from creditors or collection agents. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant has an outstanding reputation for honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness. She 
was beset by an unexpected number of medical situations: a “very hard pregnancy;” the 
birth to a premature daughter with a small hole in her heart; tubes were inserted in her

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 
99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

daughter’s ears; Applicant injured her back, necessitating back surgery on two separate 
occasions; and Applicant had surgery to fuse a neck vertebra. In addition to the medical 
costs, Applicant’s husband endured seven years without a pay raise and was unable to 
obtain another job because of a hiring freeze; and the housing market crashed. 
Applicant was forced to short-sell their residence.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.50 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Nevertheless, this decision should serve as a warning that her failure 
to continue her debt-resolution efforts or the actual accrual of new delinquent debts will 
adversely affect her future eligibility for a public trust position.51 Overall, the evidence 
leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a 
public trust position. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the 
security concerns arising from her financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through 
AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant, the decision, including the warning, should not 
be interpreted as being contingent on future monitoring of Applicant’s financial condition. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach conditions to an applicant’s public trust position. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28,

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility to 
occupy a public trust position to support a contract with the Department of Defense.  
Eligibility is granted.
