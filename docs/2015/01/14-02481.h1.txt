Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny her eligibility for a
public trust position. The evidence shows Applicant has a history of financial problems
or difficulties. But Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate the
concern stemming from her unfavorable financial history. Accordingly, this case is
decided for Applicant.
Statement of the Case
On August 26, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent Applicant a
statement of reasons (SOR) detailing a trustworthiness concern under Guideline F for
financial considerations. The action was taken under Department of Defense Directive
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as
amended (Directive); Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security
 The AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The1
AG replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Program (Jan. 1987), as amended (Regulation); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG)1
implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006. The SOR recommended submission
of Applicant’s case to an administrative judge to determine her eligibility to occupy an
automated data processing (ADP) position to support a contract with the DOD.  
Applicant’s September 27, 2014 answer to the SOR was a mix of admissions and
denials to the various delinquent debts alleged under Guideline F. She also provided an
explanation for her answer and stated that she did not desire a hearing. Department
Counsel exercised their right under the Directive to request a hearing.  And shortly2
thereafter, Applicant changed her mind and requested a hearing.3
The case was assigned to me November 20, 2014. The hearing was held
December 11, 2014. At the hearing, Department Counsel presented Exhibits 1–4, which
were admitted. Applicant presented Exhibits A–C, which were admitted. The record was
kept open until January 2, 2015, to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit a record of
payments on her ongoing Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, which was timely submitted and
admitted without objections as Exhibit D. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was
received December 22, 2014.
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a health care contractor for the Defense
Department. She is seeking to obtain eligibility to occupy a position of public trust for her
job working in a customer-service call center. Eligibility is necessary because her job
involves access to sensitive but unclassified information known as personally
identifiable information, which is commonly abbreviated as PII. 
Applicant married in 2002, and she and her husband have three children, ages 4,
6, and 12. Their marriage was recently under stress and strain with Applicant and her
husband essentially separated while living together, but they reconciled in mid-2014.4
Applicant is responsible for managing the household finances, and she stated that the
recent marital troubles caused a setback with their finances from which they are now
recovering.  Based on the household income, Applicant should have a positive net5
remainder of about $900 per month, but current spending consumes most of the

income.  Applicant is currently taking steps to involve her husband with the finances as6
well as teaching her children about household finances.  7
Applicant’s husband has been employed by a local sheriff’s office for the last six
years, he is paid a salary, and he has stable employment. Applicant’s employment
history includes lengthy periods of unemployment when she was a stay-at-home
mother; she was unemployed during 2002–2005, 2006–2007, and 2008–2013.  She8
started looking for a job in 2012 when she became concerned about her marriage. She
began her current job in early 2013; she earns $13.24 per hour; and she finds the
customer-service work rewarding because it allows her to assist servicemembers and
veterans and their families.9
The available documentary evidence shows that Applicant has a history of
financial problems or difficulties.  In general, that history, as alleged in the SOR,10
includes the following: (1) a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in 2003; (2) a Chapter 13
bankruptcy case that was filed in 2010 and has an ongoing payment plan; (3) two
unpaid judgments; (4) a $121 collection account for a consumer debt; and (5) six
medical collection accounts for a total of less than $1,500. Those matters are addressed
below.
(1) In 2003, when Applicant was unemployed due to the birth of her first child in
December 2002, she and her husband obtained relief via a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case
that discharged their liability from their then existing indebtedness.  She does not recall11
the amount of debt in the bankruptcy. She attributed the bankruptcy to her husband
being laid off from work, medical bills, and credit card bills.
(2) About seven years later in 2010, Applicant and her husband again sought
relief via bankruptcy, this time under Chapter 13.  The bankruptcy court approved a 60-12
month payment plan that requires monthly payments of $91 until about October 2015.
According to Schedule F, the bankruptcy includes about $90,353 in unsecured debt.13

from time to time.  For example, they recently made a payment of $273 (three14
payments of $91) on December 16, 2014, to cure a delinquency. Applicant explained
that they missed payments in 2014 because she was more focused on their marriage as
compared with finances.   
(3) The two unpaid judgments for $696 and $4,728 are resolved or in the process
of being resolved. The $696 judgment was filed in 2008 and stems from a credit card
debt. It is included in the ongoing Chapter 13 bankruptcy case as a $1,858 credit card
debt (the increase is due to interest, no doubt) with the same creditor.  The $4,72815
judgment, which was filed in 2007, was satisfied by garnishment of her husband’s
salary.16
(4) Applicant disputes the $121 collection account for a consumer debt because
she is currently receiving services from the original creditor.  She contacted the original17
creditor, as opposed to the collection agency, and there was no record of a delinquent
account. She had no documentation in support of her dispute.
(5) Five of the six medical collection accounts are included in the ongoing
Chapter 13 bankruptcy case for a total of about $3,911.  They are the same five18
medical collection accounts as reported in the March 2013 credit report.  Applicant19
disputes the remaining collection account for $162, as reported in the March 2014 credit
report,  because of a billing error between the medical provider and the insurance20
company.  She submitted documentation in support of the dispute.21 22
At the hearing, Applicant was serious and respectful, she answered questions
candidly, and she was knowledgeable about her family’s financial situation. I had no
concerns about her credibility.

Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant23
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 24
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect [sensitive] information.  25
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly compromise
sensitive information to obtain money or something else of value. It encompasses
concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important qualities. A
person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or
negligent in handling and safeguarding sensitive information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties, which is ongoing and unresolved. The facts indicate inability or
unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within26 27
the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying
conditions, and the facts also suggest a degree of financial irresponsibility.
I have considered the six mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and the
following are most pertinent to Applicant’s case:  28
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances;
 ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). 29
6
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control;
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
AG ¶ 20(e) the [person] has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantial the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.
The mitigating condition in AG ¶ 20(b) applies based on Applicant’s recent
marital troubles, which was a probable causative factor in the less than perfect
bankruptcy payment record. She acted responsibly under the circumstances by
reconciling with her husband and curing the delinquent bankruptcy payments.
The mitigating condition in AG ¶ 20(c) applies based on the totality of evidence
that shows Applicant and her husband are resolving their financial problems through the
court-approved Chapter 13 payment plan, and there is less than 12 months left on the
60-month plan. The Chapter 13 payment plan covers five of the six medical collection
accounts and one of the judgments while the other judgment was paid years ago. I am
also persuaded that (1) Applicant has a good handle on her family finances, and (2) she
and her husband will complete the Chapter 13 payment plan later this year.
The mitigating condition in AG ¶ 20(d) applies under essentially the same
rationale for AG ¶ 20(c).
The mitigating condition in AG ¶ 20(e) applies to the $162 medical collection
account because a billing error between a medical provider and an insurance company
is a reasonable basis to dispute a medical bill, and Applicant provided sufficient
documentation to support the dispute.   
Of course, the purpose of this case is not aimed at collecting debts.  Rather, the29
purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness
consistent with the guidelines in the Directive. In evaluating Guideline F cases, the
Appeal Board has established the following standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of a meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant

 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).31

actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement
that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.30
Here, the evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has established a plan
(namely, the Chapter 13 payment plan) and taken steps to implement that plan
sufficient to mitigate the concern. She and her husband have completed about 80% of
the Chapter 13 payment plan and have less than 12 months left before completing it in
full. At that time, they will receive a discharge relieving them from further liability for the
covered debts. In addition, Applicant, unlike many others in these financial cases, did a
good job documenting efforts made to resolve the financial problems. Taken as a whole,
the evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant is on a favorable upward trend, which
militates against recurrence of the same or similar problems.    
To conclude, the evidence leaves me with no doubt or concern about Applicant’s
eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed
the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the
unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I gave due consideration to the whole-person
concept.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial31
considerations concern.
Formal Findings

Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the interests of
national security to grant Applicant eligibility for an ADP position. Eligibility for access to
sensitive information is granted.
