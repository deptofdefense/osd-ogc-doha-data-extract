APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a trustworthiness designation.
On May 22, 2014, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
1One of the documents that Applicant has attached to his brief appears to refer to a medical debt that was
addressed in the record evidence.  The Judge resolved this debt in Applicant’s favor.  Applicant’s brief is not sufficient
to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 13-00584 at 3 (App.
Bd. Apr. 24, 2014).   
2
requested a decision on the written record.  On November 3, 2014, after considering the record,
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied
Applicant’s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶
E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant’s appeal brief contains no assertion of harmful error.  Rather, it contains new
evidence regarding his efforts at debt reduction.  We cannot consider new evidence on appeal.
Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  Our authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party
has alleged that the Judge committed harmful error.  We do not review cases de novo.  See, e.g.,
ADP Case No. 08-03372 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2009).  Therefore, the decision of the Judge denying
Applicant a trustworthiness designation is AFFIRMED.1
