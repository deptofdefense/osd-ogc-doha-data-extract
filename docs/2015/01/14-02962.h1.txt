DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, 
financial considerations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 8, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD CAF could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
 
2 
 
 
interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. On August 22, 2013, Applicant 
answered the SOR and requested a hearing. This case was assigned to me on October 
30, 2014. On November 5, 2014, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Notice of Video Teleconference Hearing scheduling the hearing for November 
14, 2014. The hearing was held as scheduled.1  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 
3, while Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through H. The record 
of the proceeding was left open until November 28, 2014, to provide Applicant an 
opportunity to present additional matters. He timely submitted documents that were 
marked as AE I through P. Applicant’s objection to GE 3, a credit report, was overruled. 
All other proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. Department 
Counsel’s memorandum forwarding Applicant’s post-hearing submission was marked 
as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. The transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was received on November 
24, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
working for that employer since March 2014. He graduated from high school in 1992 
and attended about three years of college without earning a degree. He is divorced. His 
marriage was from June 2007 to November 2011. He has an eight-year-old daughter. 
This is the first time that he is seeking a security clearance.2 
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant had seven delinquent debts, totaling $74,131. In 
his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c 
and denied the remaining allegations. His admissions are incorporated as findings of 
fact.3 
 
 In 1994, Applicant began working in his uncle’s business. In 2005, Applicant 
became the owner and operator of that business. His business had three employees 
besides himself. Due to a downturn in the economy, his business slowed in about 2008. 
His cash flow became irregular, making it difficult for him to meet his financial 
obligations. In August 2011, his business closed. Since then, he experienced periods of 
unemployment or underemployment until he obtained his current job. He also went 
through a divorce in 2011.4

SOR ¶ 1.a – unpaid federal taxes in the amount of $19,142 for tax year 2008 and 
$7,530 for tax year 2010; SOR ¶ 1.b – federal tax lien filed in September 2011 in the 
amount of $26,672; SOR ¶ 1.c – unpaid federal taxes in the amount of $2,211 for tax 
period ending 6/30/10, $2,797 for tax period ending 9/30/10, and $1,899 for tax period 
ending 12/31/10. The two unpaid tax amounts listed in SOR ¶ 1.a total exactly the 
amount of the tax lien reflected in SOR ¶ 1.b. Department Counsel agreed that the 
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b are duplicates. I also find that the amount alleged 
in SOR ¶ 1.a for tax year 2010 is a duplicate of the three unpaid quarterly payments 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c for tax year 2010. The three unpaid quarterly payments total 
$6,907, which is close to ($623 less than) the amount of unpaid taxes for 2010 reflected 
in SOR ¶ 1.a.5 
 
In his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), Applicant 
disclosed that he owed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about $48,000 in back 
taxes, had hired a tax lawyer to assist him, and indicated that this matter was resolved. 
In an Office of Personnel Management interview, he reportedly told the investigator his 
tax liens were resolved and the IRS had forgiven a significant portion of the tax debt. 
When questioned about these matters at the hearing, he stated he hired a tax attorney 
in 2011 after the IRS filed a tax lien on his house. He also explained that he intended to 
say in his e-QIP and at the OPM interview that his tax debts were in an uncollectable 
status because he was not making enough money at that time and that collection action 
on those debts was deferred.6 
 
Applicant initially owed $36,269 in taxes when he filed his 2008 IRS Form 1040. 
As of October 27, 2014, his 2008 tax liability has been reduced to $27,301. In his 
Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he owed $10,179 to the IRS for tax year 2010, 
which he indicated was in an uncollectable status until he resolved his 2008 tax debt. In 
his Answer, he also provided an IRS Form 9465, Installment Agreement Request dated 
August 19, 2014, for tax years 2008 through 2012. This form was prepared by his tax 
preparer. It did not list the total amount of unpaid taxes for those tax years as required, 
but indicated that he could pay $200 per month toward the unpaid taxes. No 
documentation was submitted to show that the IRS agreed to his installment agreement 
request, but he did provide an IRS document dated October 1, 2014, reflecting the 
address where he should send his payments. He provided copies of check stubs 
showing that he made $200 payments under the installment agreement on August 20th, 
September 27th, October 28th, and November 10th of 2014. A bank record confirmed one 
                                                          
5 Tr. 72-78. The tax lien in SOR ¶ 1.b is reflected in a credit report, GE 3. Applicant admitted the 
unpaid taxes in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c; however, independent evidence was not submitted establishing 
those unpaid taxes. Consequently, the bases for the exact figures alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c are 
unknown.

of those payments. He intends to continue making the payments until the unpaid tax 
debt is resolved.7 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d – charged-off account for $11,735. This was a vehicle loan that had a 
date of last activity of May 2011. In a divorce decree dated November 3, 2011, 
Applicant’s ex-wife was granted full ownership of this vehicle. She also agreed to 
assume financial responsibility for the vehicle and to hold him harmless for this debt. 
She failed to make the payments and the vehicle was repossessed in 2012.8 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e – past-due account for $894 with a balance of $1,606. This was a 
personal loan that was at least 60 days past due and had a date of last activity of 
September 2013. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant provided a receipt showing this 
debt was paid on August 22, 2014.9 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f – collection account for $491. This was a cable television account that 
had a date of last activity of February 2014. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant 
provided a document showing the original account had a zero balance as of August 
2014. This debt was apparently paid on May 1, 2013.10 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g – collection account for $760. This was a child-support arrearage that 
had a date of last activity of February 2014. Applicant and his ex-wife share joint 
custody of their daughter. In general, each has custody of their daughter every other 
week. Under this arrangement, his child support obligation consists of paying $10 per 
week for his daughter’s health insurance. His pay is garnished for those child support 
payments. In his post-hearing submission, he provided a receipt from the state’s child 
support enforcement service dated November 17, 2014, showing he is up to date on his 
child support payments.11 
 
Applicant testified that his annual salary in his new job is about $40,000. This job 
provides him the opportunity to work a significant amount of overtime. Taking into 
consideration his overtime earnings, his annual income is between $60,000 and 
$70,000. He testified that, besides the tax debt, he had no other delinquent debts. His 
only other debts are a mortgage loan and truck loan, both of which are in good standing. 
He estimated that his net monthly remainder was about $800 to $900. At the time of the 
hearing, he had about $2,500 in a checking account and about $5,000 in a 401(k)

account. His mother resides with him. He has been supporting her since she lost her job 
in March 2013.12 
 
Applicant’s probationary employment appraisal for his new job indicated that he 
met all standards, had an excellent work ethic, and was a welcomed addition to the 
workforce. He was highly recommended for a permanent position. A former employer 
stated that Applicant was very responsible and dedicated employee. A longtime friend 
described Applicant as a man of integrity who was extremely dedicated to his family.13 
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, to reach his decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict

13 AE C, D, E.

guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant accumulated delinquent debts that he was unable to satisfy for an 
extended period. This evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. 
 
 
7 
 
 
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant’s financial problems are ongoing. From the evidence presented, I 
cannot find that those problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG 20(a) does not apply. 
 
 In about 2011, Applicant’s business failed due to a downturn in the economy. 
Following the failure of his business, he encountered periods of unemployment and 
underemployment. He also went through a divorce. Those events were conditions 
beyond his control that contributed to his financial problems. Nevertheless, his tax 
problems were the result of him failing to allocate a sufficient portion of his income to his 
taxes. He only merits partial credit under AG ¶ 20(b).  
 
 Applicant has resolved the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g. One of those debts 
(SOR ¶ 1.e) was resolved after issuance of the SOR. AG ¶ 20(d) applies to the resolved 
debts. 
 
 The total amount of Applicant’s past-due tax debt is unclear, but appears to be at 
least $37,000. After issuance of the SOR, he submitted to the IRS a proposed 
installment payment agreement to resolve his unpaid taxes. The proposed installment 
plan is for tax years 2008 through 2012, but does not indicate the amount of past-due 
taxes owed. It is unknown whether the IRS accepted the proposed payment plan. He 
submitted check stubs showing that he made four $200 monthly payments under the 
proposed agreement. Those payments are about a quarter of his net monthly 
 
8 
 
 
remainder. From the evidence presented, It would appear that he could be paying more 
monthly toward this indebtedness. His payments under the proposed agreement merit 
partial credit under AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d).  
 
 Applicant established that his wife is responsible under a divorce decree for the 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.d and that she had agreed to hold him harmless for that debt. AG ¶ 
20(e) applies to the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).  
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a valued employee. He has been recommended for a permanent 
position in his current company. He resolved three of his debts and recently took steps 
towards addressing his large past-due tax debt. Nevertheless, his recent efforts have 
failed to fully mitigate the security concerns arising from his past-due taxes. His 
statements in his e-QIP and during the OPM interview that indicated his tax debt was 
resolved are troubling. His explanation for the existence of those incorrect statements 
was less than convincing.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant 
 
   Subparagraph 1.a:   For Applicant 
   Subparagraph 1.b:   Against Applicant 
   Subparagraphs 1.c -1.g:  For Applicant 
    
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
