GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations and 
personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information 
is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 5, 2014, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security 
clearance application.1 On July 31, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility – Division A (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective

September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial 
Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct) and detailed reasons why the DOD 
adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to 
an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on August 12, 2014. In a sworn statement, dated 
August 27, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have his 
case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.2 On September 23, 2014, 
pursuant to Directive ¶ E3.1.7., Department Counsel requested a hearing.3 Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on November 6, 2014. The 
case was assigned to me on November 14, 2014. A Notice of Hearing was issued on 
December 2, 2014, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 17, 2014. 
 
During the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR ¶ 1.j. by deleting 
the amount $1,500 and substituting therefor the amount $15. There being no objection 
by Applicant, the motion was granted, and SOR ¶ 1.j. was amended.4 Also during the 
hearing, four Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4) and nine Applicant Exhibits (AE 
A through AE I) were admitted into evidence. GE 3 was admitted into evidence over 
Applicant’s objection.5 Applicant and one witness testified. The transcript (Tr.) was 
received on January 5, 2015. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement 
it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity. He submitted additional documents 
which were marked as AE J through AE L and admitted into evidence without objection. 
The record closed on January 14, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations and personal conduct (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.j., and 
2.a.). After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his employer as an electronics technician since March 2006.6 He is a May 1980 high 
school graduate.7 Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in August 1981, and he 
served on active duty until he was honorably discharged in April 1991. He subsequently 
served with the Air Force Reserve from May 1994 until he was again honorably

discharged in May 2000.8 He has held a secret security clearance since 2004.9 
Applicant was married to his first wife in July 1981, and they divorced in June 1984; to 
his second wife in February 1990, and they divorced in April 1995; and to his current 
wife in May 2006.10 Applicant has two children: a son born in 1982, and a daughter born 
in 1983.11 
 
Financial Considerations 
The SOR identified ten delinquent debts that had been placed for collection, as 
reflected by a March 2014 Experian credit report.12 Those ten debts, including two child- 
support accounts, seven medical accounts, and one library account, totaled 
approximately $151,736 (reduced by the amended SOR to $150,251). Applicant 
obtained a newer Experian credit report in April 201413 that identified six individuals with 
the same or similar names who resided at various different addresses in seven different 
states.14 He disputed the medical accounts for several reasons: the names of the 
debtors reflected in the credit report differed from his, either by a different spelling of his 
first name, or a different middle name; the social security numbers of other individuals 
listed as debtors were different from his; he had never resided at the addresses 
identified; the medical accounts were not his because he has medical insurance for 
himself, his wife, and her minor children, and he had never received service from the 
identified medical providers.15 The respective current status of the accounts, according 
to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by the Government and Applicant, and 
Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below. 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): There is a medical account with a remaining and past-due balance 
of $771 that was placed for collection in January 2014, as reported by Experian.16

Applicant disputed the account for the reasons set forth above.17 Additionally, it appears 
that the reported medical provider is located in the same state, but over 500 miles from 
Applicant’s residence or workplace. The account was deleted from Applicant’s credit 
report, and as of October 30, 2014, it is no longer listed.18 The account, erroneously 
reported as Applicant’s, has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c.): There are two child-support accounts with remaining and 
past-due balances of $129,521 and $18,243 that were placed for collection in March 
2014, as reported by Experian.19 Applicant disputed the accounts for several additional 
reasons: the account number that he previously had for both of his children was 
different from the ones in the credit report; he had routinely made timely child support 
payments through the state where he resided; those payments ended at least ten years 
earlier; and the debtor for the state child support enforcement division referred to in the 
credit report was for someone with a different middle name.20 Applicant’s social security 
number was removed from the state child support division’s system, the adverse listings 
of those accounts were deleted from Applicant’s credit report, and as of October 30, 
2014, they are no longer listed.21 The accounts, erroneously reported as Applicant’s, 
have been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): There is a medical account with a remaining and past-due balance 
of $699 that was placed for collection in August 2011, as reported by Experian.22 
Applicant disputed the account for the same reasons as set forth above.23 Additionally, it 
appears that the reported medical provider is located in another state nearly 900 miles 
from Applicant’s residence or workplace. The account was deleted from Applicant’s 
credit report, and as of October 30, 2014, it is no longer listed.24 The account, 
erroneously reported as Applicant’s, has been resolved. 
 (SOR ¶¶ 1.e. through 1.h.): There are four medical accounts with remaining and 
past-due balances of $660, $236, $348, and $127 that were placed for collection by the 
same medical provider (through two different collection agents) in September 2012 or

February 2013, as reported by Experian.25 Applicant disputed the accounts for the same 
reasons as set forth above.26 Additionally, it appears that the reported medical provider 
is located in another state nearly 700 miles from Applicant’s residence or workplace. 
The accounts, as well as two others from the same medical provider, were deleted from 
Applicant’s credit report, and as of October 30, 2014, they are no longer listed.27 The 
accounts, erroneously reported as Applicant’s, have been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.i.): There is a medical account with a remaining and past-due balance 
of $225 that was placed for collection in March 2013, as reported by Experian.28 
Applicant disputed the account for the same reasons as set forth above.29 Additionally, it 
appears that the reported medical provider is located in another state over 700 miles 
from Applicant’s residence or workplace. The account was deleted from Applicant’s 
credit report, and as of October 30, 2014, it is no longer listed.30 The account, 
erroneously reported as Applicant’s, has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.j.): There is a library account with a remaining and past-due balance of 
$15 that was placed for collection in October 2011, as reported by Experian.31 Applicant 
disputed the account because had never been to the library and had no contact with it.32 
Additionally, it appears that the reported library is located in another state nearly 900 
miles from Applicant’s residence or workplace. The account was deleted from 
Applicant’s credit report, and as of October 30, 2014, it is no longer listed.33 The 
account, erroneously reported as Applicant’s, has been resolved. 
Applicant’s most recent credit report – from October 2014 – reveals that he has a 
credit score of 746 from each of the three major credit reporting agencies, and they 
have characterized his credit category as excellent.34 He has no delinquent accounts.35

Personal Conduct 
 
 (SOR ¶ 2.a.): On March 5, 2014, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he 
responded to questions pertaining to his financial record. One question in Section 26 – 
Financial Record (Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts) asked if, in the last seven 
years, he had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; been over 120 days 
delinquent on any debt not previously entered, and if he was currently over 120 days 
delinquent on any debt. Applicant answered “no” to those questions. He certified that 
the response was “true, complete, and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief, 
but, based on an analysis of his credit report, the response to those questions was 
considered to be false, for at that time, Applicant’s credit report erroneously listed 
several accounts that had been placed for collection. He steadfastly denied the 
accounts were his and disputed them. As noted above, his disputes were successful 
and the derogatory information was removed from his credit report. 
  
Work Performance and Character References 
 Applicant’s supervisor initially hired Applicant 12 or 13 years ago when they were 
with a different contractor on the same contract. He characterized Applicant in highly 
favorable terms. Applicant is very honest, dependable, helpful, and trustworthy, with 
integrity. Applicant has not missed any time from work for medical reasons.36  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”37 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”38   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information.

An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”39 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.40  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”41 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”42 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
  
 The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a “history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s most significant financial problem arose because of 
erroneous reporting of delinquent accounts belonging to individuals other than himself, 
who happened to have similar first and last names, sometimes with a different spelling 
of the first name and sometimes with a completely different middle name. Applicant was 
able to identify six such individuals who resided at various different addresses in seven 
different states. He steadfastly denied the accounts were his and disputed them. His 
disputes were successful, and the derogatory information was removed from his credit 
report. Applicant’s most recent credit report – from October 2014 – reveals that he has a 
credit score of 746 from each of the three major credit reporting agencies, and that they 
have characterized his credit category as excellent. He has no delinquent accounts. As 
it pertains to the alleged financial considerations, Applicant’s evidence has refuted and 
overcome the Government’s case. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) have not been established. In 
this instance, I conclude that Applicant’s actions do cast doubt on his reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG & 15:       
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
9 
                                      
 
 
 The guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns. Under AG ¶ 
16(a), it is potentially disqualifying if there is 
a deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
 On March 5, 2014, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he responded to certain 
questions pertaining to his financial record. One question in Section 26 – Financial 
Record (Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts) asked if, in the last seven years, he 
had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; been over 120 days delinquent on 
any debt not previously entered, and if he was currently over 120 days delinquent on 
any debt. Applicant answered “no” to those questions. He certified that the response 
was “true, complete, and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief, but, based on 
an analysis of his credit report, the response to those questions was considered by the 
CAF to be false, for at that time, Applicant’s credit report erroneously listed several 
accounts that had been placed for collection. He steadfastly denied the accounts were 
his and disputed them. His disputes were successful and the derogatory information 
was removed from his credit report. Under these circumstances, Applicant’s response 
was accurate and truthful. As it pertains to the alleged personal conduct, Applicant’s 
evidence has refuted and overcome the Government’s case. AG ¶ 16(a) has not been 
established. In this instance, I conclude that Applicant’s actions do cast doubt on his 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
 
10 
                                      
 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.43  
      
 There is no evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant’s credit 
report erroneously listed several accounts that had been placed for collection. He 
steadfastly denied the accounts were his and disputed them. Those disputes were 
successful and the derogatory information was removed from his credit report. 
 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is substantial. Applicant 
has an outstanding reputation in the military and in the workplace. He did not have any 
financial problems except for the erroneous reporting of derogatory information in his 
credit report. While it is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can 
normally meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under Directive ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations, and the burden shifts to an applicant 
to establish either that he or she is not responsible for the debts in question, or that 
matters in mitigation apply,44 in this instance, Applicant has successfully refuted the 
contents of the credit report and the allegations in the SOR. Overall, the evidence 
leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a 
security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has successfully 
refuted and overcome the security concerns arising from his financial considerations 
and personal conduct. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).
