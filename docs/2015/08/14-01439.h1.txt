GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 6, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On June 6, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial

Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on June 19, 2014. In sworn statement, dated July 8, 
2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge “in the event that you do determine my clearance should be 
revoked.”2 On September 11, 2014, he withdrew his request for a hearing and elected 
to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.3 A complete copy of 
the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on March 
19, 2015, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of 
the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. 
In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the 
Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on March 31, 2015. A 
response was due by April 30, 2015. On April 28, 2015, Applicant submitted his 
response with attachments. Department Counsel had no objections to the documents 
submitted, and I marked them as Applicant Items (AI) A through AI G. The case was 
assigned to me on May 15, 2015.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a., 1.b., 1.d. through 1.j., and a 
portion of 1.k.). He was unable to admit or deny the remaining allegations pertaining to 
medical debts because the creditors are unidentified. Applicant’s admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as a manufacturing engineer with his current employer since June 1980.4 A 
1973 high school graduate, Applicant received a bachelor’s degree in an unspecified 
discipline in 1978.5 He has never served with the U.S. military.6 Applicant was granted a 
secret security clearance in 1980.7 Applicant was married in October 1982.8 He has four

home.9 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until 1999 when he 
experienced the first of many significant medical conditions, some of which required 
multiple procedures, including open-heart surgery. He suffered a heart attack in the fall 
of 1999, had multiple stents implanted in his coronary arteries at different times, and 
had a dual cardioverter-defibrillator implanted. In addition, he had issues with his 
kidney, prostate, arthritis, diabetes, and a lung tumor.10 Applicant’s wife had to stop 
working to enable her to care for her dying mother. Family finances were also affected 
by a business down-turn.11 Health insurance failed to cover all of his medical 
expenses.12 As a result of a combination of those factors, Applicant had insufficient 
money to maintain his monthly payments, and various accounts became delinquent and 
were placed for collection. Two tax liens were filed by the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS). Applicant attempted to reduce expenses, and he obtained a mortgage 
modification which lowered his interest rate from 10.45 percent to 6.75 percent, 
decreasing his monthly mortgage payment by nearly $200; attempted to qualify for the 
IRS’s Fresh Start Program; and took a loan from his 401(k) retirement account and 
contacted his creditors in an effort to resolve his delinquent accounts.13 
The SOR identified 16 delinquent debts that had been placed for collection, as 
reflected by a September 2013 credit report,14 and a May 2014 credit report.15 Those 16 
debts total approximately $229,602. Those allegations and their respective current 
status, according to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by the Government and 
Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b.): These are two federal tax liens filed against Applicant in 
2009 for $62,464 and 2010 for $3,428, which related to the failure of Applicant’s wife to 
set up withholding of income tax for the tax years 2004 through 2006, and Applicant and 
his wife’s failure to pay the income tax on her self-employment income.16 Applicant’s 
wife did their taxes for 32 years, and she realized her mistakes. They were unable to

pay the taxes, and in 2009, she entered into an installment agreement with the IRS and 
started paying $1,500 per month. That monthly amount was initially reduced to $1,275 
and subsequently to $863.17 The accounts are in the process of being resolved. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.d., 1.e., and 1.g. through 1.j.): These are six different medical 
accounts in the amounts of $35, $27, $154, $28, $156, and $35 that were placed for 
collection.18 The accounts were transferred to another collection agent. A repayment 
plan was accepted and the accounts were paid off.19 The accounts have been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.k.): This is a home mortgage for over $162,000 that was initially 
established over a decade ago. The loan was refinanced, but the interest rate was 
10.45 percent. The loan was subsequently sold to the servicing company identified in 
the SOR. When Applicant’s wife attempted to obtain a loan modification, she was 
advised that she was unable to do so because the account was current and it had to be 
delinquent to qualify. Following the guidance of the servicing company, Applicant and 
his wife withheld some of their monthly payments in late 2013. When they attempted to 
follow up with the servicing company, they had difficulty contacting that company and 
sometimes spoke with representatives located overseas. The servicing company 
claimed it had not received the necessary application documentation.20  The account, 
which was current in September 2013, saw the foreclosure process start in early 2014.21 
The frustration experienced by Applicant and his wife motivated them to reverse their 
actions and reject the guidance received from the servicing company. They abandoned 
their modification efforts and paid the past-due balance, bringing the account current 
once again.22 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.c. and 1.p.): This is an unspecified medical account with a high credit 
of $275 and an unpaid balance of $286 that was placed for collection in 2013.23 The 
collection agent increased the balance to $298.24 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant

 It should be noted that Applicant submitted a press release from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau reporting that the servicing company had been ordered to provide $2,000,000,000 in relief to homeowners for 
systemic wrongs including failing to provide accurate information about loan modifications and also failing to properly 
process borrowers applications. See Atch E (Press Release, dated December 19, 2013) to Item 2.

was unable to identify the original creditor alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. and when he called the 
collection agent identified in SOR ¶ 1.p., no records were identified.25 In his Response 
to the FORM, Applicant contended the two separate alleged accounts were the same 
account, and that they had been paid.26 He stated that the proof of his payment was one 
of the documents he had previously referred to as having resolved SOR ¶¶ 1.d., 1.e., 
and 1.g. through 1.j.27 While there is substantial evidence that the two allegations refer 
to the same account, and that two payments in the total amount of $237.56 were made 
in April and May 2014, the evidence is less compelling that the payments can be 
connected to these two alleged accounts without further documentation or explanation. 
The account has not been resolved. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.f., and 1.l. through 1.o.): These are five medical accounts with various 
identified and unidentified medical providers in the amounts of $403, $134, $112, $42, 
and $42 that were placed for collection.28 During his OPM interview in October 2013, 
Applicant offered a variety of explanations as to why the accounts were delinquent and 
what his repayment plans were. Some accounts became delinquent because of a 
dispute or miscommunication between Applicant, the medical provider, and the 
insurance company (SOR ¶¶ 1.f. and 1.m.); another account he simply forgot about 
(SOR ¶ 1.l.); and others about which he denied having any knowledge.29 Applicant’s 
subsequent explanations and contentions regarding these accounts were generally 
inconsistent. He contended he had settled or otherwise paid off some of the accounts 
without submitting any documentation to support those purported payments; disputed 
the debts, also without furnishing documentation; or claimed he was unable to identify 
the individual healthcare provider, including some of those previously identified as 
having been paid.30  These accounts have not been resolved. 
With his Answer to the SOR, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement 
in which he indicated his net monthly income was $8,034, and his estimated monthly 
expenses were $6,535, leaving a monthly remainder of $1,499 available for 
discretionary spending or savings.31 His annual salary is $154,839.32 Applicant has a 
salaried savings plan with an approximate balance of $134,000, and a restricted stock 
plan worth approximately $56,000.33 There is no evidence that Applicant ever received

financial counseling. While he is in a repayment plan with the IRS, and some of the 
smaller medical accounts have not yet been resolved, it appears that Applicant’s 
financial problems are under control. 
Work Performance 
 In Applicant’s 2014 Performance Rating, his supervisor noted that Applicant “is 
the ultimate professional and is able to sort complex problems into actions that provide 
innovative solutions to issues. His attitude and friendliness help him and make him a 
most valued employee.”34 Applicant was given a rating of 4.7 out of 5.0 for “significantly 
exceeded commitments.”35 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”36 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”37   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.

In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”38 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.39  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”40 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”41 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems initially arose in 1999 and continued 
for several years thereafter. Accounts became delinquent and were placed for 
collection, and two federal tax liens were filed. It was also alleged that a residence had 
gone into foreclosure. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”42 Under AG ¶ 20(e) it is potentially mitigating if “the individual has a 
                                                          
42
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].  
 
 
9 
                                      
 
reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the 
problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by his frivolous or irresponsible 
spending, and he did not spend beyond his means. Instead, those financial problems 
were largely beyond his control. They initially arose in 1999, when he experienced the 
first of many significant medical conditions. He suffered a heart attack, had open-heart 
surgery, multiple stents were implanted in his coronary arteries at different times, and 
had a dual cardioverter-defibrillator implanted. He experienced other maladies with his 
kidney, prostate, arthritis, diabetes, and a lung tumor. Applicant’s wife had to stop 
working to care for her dying mother. There was a business down-turn. Health 
insurance failed to cover all of his medical expenses. Applicant’s wife, the person who 
did the family income tax returns for 32 years, failed to set up proper withholding for her 
self-employment income. As a result of a combination of those factors, Applicant had 
insufficient money to maintain his monthly payments, and various accounts became 
delinquent and were placed for collection. Applicant attempted to reduce expenses, and 
he obtained a mortgage modification, decreasing his monthly mortgage payment by 
nearly $200; attempted to qualify for the IRS’s Fresh Start Program; and took a loan 
from his 401(k) retirement account and contacted his creditors in an effort to resolve his 
delinquent accounts. 
 
Applicant’s delinquent income taxes (and two tax liens) are in an installment 
agreement, and after paying $1,500 per month, his payments are now $863 per month. 
Six different medical accounts were resolved. His home mortgage was sold to a 
servicing company who mishandled Applicant’s efforts to obtain a loan modification. It 
counseled Applicant to stop making monthly payments in order to enable Applicant to 
qualify for the modification, and when Applicant did so, the servicing company reported 
the mortgage as having gone into foreclosure, and failed to maintain contact with 
Applicant or to process the application. It was apparently the same reason the servicing 
company was fined $2,000,000,000 for systemic wrongs involving other borrowers. As a 
result, Applicant rejected further guidance from the servicing company, abandoned the 
loan modification, and brought the loan current.  
 
There remain unresolved approximately six other medical accounts. The 
evidence is inconsistent as to whether or not Applicant knows the identity of the 
individual medical providers; if there are valid disputes regarding some of the 
unresolved medical accounts; or if they have been settled, for Applicant failed to submit 
documentation to support his contentions that disputes had been filed or accounts had 
been settled and paid. Nevertheless, there are clear indications that Applicant’s financial 
problems are under control. His actions do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.43

Security clearance adjudications are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The 
adjudicative guidelines do not require an applicant to establish resolution of each and 
every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve 
financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no 
requirement that an applicant immediately resolve or make payments on all delinquent 
debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in an SOR be 
paid first. Rather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the 
payment of such debts one at a time.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.44   
     
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant failed 
to insure that the family federal income tax returns that his wife filed were accurate and 
that she had taken steps to set up withholding of her self-employment income. His 
payments to healthcare providers were not made in a timely manner. As a result, 
accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection. Two tax liens were filed. 
 
The mitigating evidence is more substantial and compelling. There is no 
evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling protected 
information, substance abuse, or criminal conduct. Applicant’s financial problems were 
not caused by his frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his 
means. Rather, they were largely beyond his control. They initially arose in 1999, when

he was significantly negatively impacted by a lengthy series of serious health issues. 
They were exacerbated when Applicant’s wife failed to have her self-employment 
income withheld, and when she had to quit her job to care for her dying mother. 
Applicant did not ignore his delinquent accounts. Instead, he reduced expenses; sought 
a mortgage modification; took out a loan from his 401(k); set up an installment 
agreement with the IRS; and paid off six medical accounts. While six other medical 
accounts remain unresolved, his difficulties of identifying the actual healthcare providers 
cannot be overemphasized. Nevertheless, there are clear indications that Applicant’s 
financial problems are under control.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:45 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of ‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.’ However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has ‘. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.’ The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (‘Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.’) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts, and he started to do so years before the SOR was issued. This 
decision should serve as a warning that Applicant’s failure to continue his debt 
resolution efforts pertaining to his tax liens and delinquent medical accounts, or the 
actual accrual of new delinquent debts, will adversely affect his future eligibility for 
security clearance.46

 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant as security officials may continue to monitor his 
finances, this decision, including the warning, should not be interpreted as a conditional eligibility to hold a security 
clearance. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach limiting conditions to an 
applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR 
Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006); ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. June 30, 2005); ISCR 
Case No. 03-17410 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0109 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000).

Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. 
See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.p.:  For Applicant 
   
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
