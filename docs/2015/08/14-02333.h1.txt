GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 25, 2014, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On July 28, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial

Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. In a statement, notarized August 25, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a 
hearing.2 A complete copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was 
provided to Applicant on May 20, 2015, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a 
period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in 
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant received the FORM on May 29, 2015. A 
response was due by June 28, 2015. On an unspecified date before that due-date, 
Applicant submitted his Response to the FORM, including documents. Department 
Counsel had no objections to the documents submitted, and I marked them as Applicant 
Items (AI) A through AI I. The case was assigned to me on July 31, 2015.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.j.). Applicant’s 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as an embedded software engineer with his current employer since June 1988.3 
He received a bachelor’s degree in 1988.4 He has never served with the U.S. military.5 
Applicant has held a secret security clearance since 2005.6 He was married in 1992, 
and divorced in 2012.7 He has four children, including three sons (born in 1990, 1992, 
and 2000) and a daughter (born in 2002).8

Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2012. He 
usually saved and spent wisely on normal everyday items. He used credit only to build it 
up to facilitate his eventual purchase of a house and a car. He kept a budget and 
always paid his credit cards when they were due, and he never carried a balance. That 
process continued during the first ten years of his marriage. Eventually, he relaxed his 
practice of paying off his balances each month. He borrowed funds from his 401(k) to 
purchase some property with the intent of building a residence, but his wife decided she 
did not wish to reside in the area. He obtained a home loan for $202,000 to purchase 
another property upon which he built a house, and in August 2008, the completed 
house was appraised at $214,000. His routine payments lowered the balance of the 
mortgage to approximately $190,000.  
 
In 2012, Applicant and his wife went through a divorce. As the main source of 
family income, Applicant was expected to pay the majority of the divorce costs, 
including the attorneys’ fees.  In order to do so, Applicant charged their fees to his credit 
cards. The divorce required Applicant to pay $445 in child support per week. Applicant 
was awarded both the house and the undeveloped property. He had hoped to refinance 
his home mortgage, but because of the poor economy and the housing market collapse, 
the appraisal indicated the house was worth only $130,000, or $60,000 less than the 
remaining mortgage. That dashed his refinancing plans and his intentions to pay off the 
lien on the undeveloped property, sell that property, and pay off his credit cards. The 
combination of credit card debt and child support payments left Applicant with 
significantly less money than he was earning.9 
 
In July 2012, Applicant engaged the professional services of a law firm to 
represent him in negotiating with five to seven creditors to establish repayment plans 
and settle the accounts. The process included Applicant making periodic payments into 
a law firm trust account to be used for settlement negotiations.10 Applicant has been 
making monthly payments of approximately $746. Also, following the guidance of his 
attorneys, Applicant stopped his individual payments to his creditors to facilitate the 
negotiation process.11 
The SOR identified ten purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, totaling 
approximately $72,357, which had been placed for collection or charged off. Those 
debts and their respective current status, according to an Equifax credit report,12 
Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, his Response to the FORM, and various submissions 
by him, are described as follows:

(SOR ¶ 1.a.): This is a bank and telephone credit card loan account with a credit 
limit of $15,200 and an unpaid balance of approximately $13,837 that was placed for 
collection and charged off.13 Applicant made monthly payments to the creditor through 
his law firm, and the creditor agreed to a settlement in November 2013.14 On November 
3, 2014, the creditor issued him a Form 1099-C which indicated $6,871.53 of the debt 
was discharged.15 The Equifax credit report reflects a zero balance along with a note 
that the account was paid for less than the full balance.16 The account has been 
resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This is a bank credit card loan account with a credit limit of $16,690 
and an unpaid balance of approximately $10,432 that was placed for collection and 
charged off.17 Applicant made monthly payments to the creditor through his law firm, 
and the creditor agreed to a settlement in June 2013.18 On May 21, 2014, the creditor 
issued him a Form 1099-C which indicated $7,935.25 of the debt was discharged.19 The 
Equifax credit report reflects a zero balance along with a note that the account was paid 
for less than the full balance.20 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.c. and 1.j.): This is a bank credit card account with a past-due balance 
of $1,657 and unpaid balance of $9,342 that was placed for collection and charged 
off.21Applicant contends that the charged-off account was placed with the collection 
agency specified in SOR ¶ 1.j., but other than his assertion, there is no evidence in the 
case file, including the Equifax credit report, in which that company is mentioned. 
Applicant’s law firm is continuing negotiations with the creditor in an effort to resolve the 
account.22 The account has not yet been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): This is a bank credit card account with a credit limit of $3,000 and 
an unpaid balance of approximately $2,629 that was placed for collection and charged 
off.23 Applicant made monthly payments to the creditor through his law firm, and the 
creditor apparently agreed to a settlement.24 On December 31, 2014, the creditor issued

credit report reflects a zero balance along with a note that the account was paid for less 
than the full balance.26 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.e. and 1.i.): This is a bank financial services credit card account with 
an unpaid balance of $4,589 that was placed for collection with a law firm and charged 
off in the amount of $4,906.27 Applicant contends that the charged-off account was 
placed with the collection agency specified in SOR ¶ 1.i.28 The collection agency 
acknowledged buying the account and increasing the past-due balance to $7,205.29 
Applicant’s law firm is continuing negotiations with the creditor in an effort to resolve the 
account.30 The account has not yet been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): This is a bank credit card account with a credit limit of $7,000 that 
was placed for collection and charged off in the amount of $5,578.31 The new creditor 
acknowledged transferring or buying the account.32 The balance was apparently 
increased to $6,698.33 Applicant’s law firm is continuing negotiations with the creditor in 
an effort to resolve the account.34 The account has not yet been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): This is a credit card account with a credit limit of $8,300 and high 
credit of $10,654 that was current at the time the Equifax credit report was issued in 
February 2015.35 The account had a remaining balance of $3,372, and there was no 
past due balance.36  Other than Applicant’s apparently inadvertent admission regarding 
the allegation in the SOR, there is no evidence to support that allegation that, as of July 
2014 when the SOR was issued, the account had been placed for collection in the 
amount of $10,800. Moreover, no such account is listed with Applicant’s law firm for 
possible negotiated settlements. In the absence of meaningful evidence to the contrary, 
the account continues to be current or has been resolved.

that was placed for collection and charged off in the amount of $2,039.37 The account 
was transferred or sold to an unspecified entity.38 Applicant’s law firm is continuing 
negotiations with the creditor in an effort to resolve the account.39 The account has not 
yet been resolved. 
As of June 2015, Applicant’s law firm had approximately $8,526 in escrow to 
apply to Applicant’s remaining delinquent accounts.40 Applicant noted that he was on a 
four-year plan to resolve all of his delinquent debts, and he was, as of the time of his 
Answer to the SOR, already half-way through the plan.41 Applicant has no other more 
recent delinquent debts. With the exception of those unresolved debts listed in the SOR, 
Applicant’s financial situation is stable and steadily improving. He is able to meet all of 
his other monthly financial obligations. Applicant’s financial problems appear to be 
under control. 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”42 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”43   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The

administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”44 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.45  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”46 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”47 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems initially arose in 2012 and continued 
for several years thereafter. Because of his divorce and child support payments, in 
2012, he was unable to continue making his routine monthly payments and some 
accounts became delinquent. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”48  
                                                          
48
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating 
condition].  
 
 
9 
                                      
 
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) all apply. AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies. As noted 
above, Applicant routinely kept a budget and always paid his credit cards when they 
were due, and he never carried a balance. That process continued during the first ten 
years of his marriage, but it was eventually relaxed in order to build a residence. In 
2012, his divorce, divorce attorney payments for himself and his wife, $445 weekly child 
support payments, the poor economy, and the collapsing housing market, combined to 
dramatically reduce his investments and finances to the point where he could not 
refinance his mortgage or continue making his normal monthly payments. The value of 
his property vanished, and his home value was $60,000 underwater. Applicant’s 
financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did 
not spend beyond his means. Instead, Applicant’s financial problems were largely 
beyond his control. Faced with his newly developed financial problems, Applicant 
immediately recognized the seriousness of his situation and engaged the professional 
services of a law firm to represent him in negotiating with his creditors to establish 
repayment plans and settle the accounts. The process included Applicant making 
periodic payments into a law firm trust account to be used for settlement negotiations. 
Since that professional relationship commenced, Applicant has been making monthly 
payments of approximately $746. 
Applicant’s has managed to pay off or otherwise resolve four of the accounts 
listed in the SOR.49 His law firm continues to negotiate with the remaining creditors and 
has amassed approximately $8,526 in escrow to apply to those remaining delinquent 
accounts.50 At the time of his Answer to the SOR, Applicant was already half-way 
through his four-year plan to resolve all of his delinquent debts. He has no other more 
recent delinquent debts. With the exception of those unresolved debts listed in the SOR, 
Applicant’s financial situation is stable and steadily improving. He is able to meet all of 
his other monthly financial obligations. Applicant’s financial problems appear to be 
under control, largely attributed to his continuing good-faith efforts to pay his creditors.

 There is a substantial risk when one accepts, at face value, the contents of a credit report without 
obtaining original source documentation to verify entries. Credit bureaus collect information from a variety of sources, 
including public records and “other sources,” and it is these other unidentified sources that are the cause for concern. 
Likewise, when accounts are transferred, reassigned, sold, or merely churned, an individual’s credit history can look 
worse than it really is. In this particular instance, the credit report referred to numerous creditors for relatively few 
delinquent accounts. Because of abbreviated names and acronyms, as well as incomplete account numbers, many of 
those entries are garbled and redundant, and have inflated the financial concerns. Furthermore, the absence of 
account numbers or original creditors in the SOR and only partial accounts numbers in the credit report makes the 
analysis that much more difficult.

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting him, do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.51 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.52   
     
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. In 2012, 
Applicant’s financial status deteriorated to the point where he was no longer capable to 
maintaining his normal monthly payments. Various accounts became delinquent or were 
charged off.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and he did not spend beyond his means. Rather, Applicant’s problems were largely 
beyond his control. Applicant routinely kept a budget and always paid his credit cards 
when they were due, and he never carried a balance. That process continued during the 
first ten years of his marriage. In 2012, things changed dramatically. Applicant and his 
wife divorced, and the costs of the divorce, payments for both divorce attorneys, $445 
weekly child support payments, the poor economy, and the collapsing housing market, 
combined to essentially destroy his ability to continue making his normal monthly 
payments or refinance his residence. With the assistance of a law firm, Applicant’s has 
managed to pay off or otherwise resolve four of the accounts listed in the SOR. The law 
firm continues to negotiate with the remaining creditors and has approximately $8,526 in

escrow to apply to those remaining delinquent accounts. Applicant’s financial situation is 
stable and steadily improving. He is able to meet all of his other monthly financial 
obligations. Applicant’s financial problems appear to be under control. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:53 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. That effort commenced in July 2012, two years before the SOR was 
issued. His actions, under the circumstances confronting him, do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The entire situation occurred under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.  
This decision should serve as a warning that Applicant’s failure to continue his 
debt resolution efforts or the actual accrual of new delinquent debts will adversely affect 
his future eligibility for a security clearance.54 Overall, the evidence leaves me without 
questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns 
arising from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant as security officials may continue to monitor his 
finances, this decision, including the warning, should not be interpreted as a conditional access to classified 
information. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach limiting conditions to an 
applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR 
Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006); ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005); ISCR 
Case No. 03-17410 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0109 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000).

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant  
Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f:    For Applicant  
Subparagraph 1.g:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.h:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.i:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.j:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
