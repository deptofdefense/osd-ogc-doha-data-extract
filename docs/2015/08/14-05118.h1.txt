GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 12, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On December 2, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the DOD on September

1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and 
detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators could not make an affirmative finding under 
the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative 
judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on December 17, 2014. In a sworn statement, dated 
January 5, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. On June 2, 2015, Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to me on June 5, 2015. 
A Notice of Hearing was issued on June 8, 2015. I convened the hearing, as scheduled, 
on June 25, 2015. 
 
 During the hearing, four Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4) and seven 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE G) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant and one witness testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on 
July 6, 2015. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took 
advantage of that opportunity. He submitted additional documents that were marked as 
AE H through AE J and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on 
July 15, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted four of the factual allegations in the 
SOR under financial considerations (¶¶ 1.b., and 1.e. through 1.g.). Department 
Counsel subsequently moved to amend the SOR by withdrawing SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.d. 
Applicant did not object to the motion, and the motion was granted.2 Applicant’s 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as a principal engineer since April 2007.3 He was previously employed by 
another defense contractor as an operational architect.4 A June 1982 high school 
graduate,5 Applicant earned two bachelor’s degrees and a master’s degree.6 He was 
initially granted a security clearance, the level of which was not revealed, in 1985,7 and

a top secret security clearance in 2004.8 Applicant served in an enlisted capacity with 
the U.S. Army from January 1985 until September 2005, and he retired as a sergeant 
first class (E7) with an honorable discharge.9 Applicant was married in 1983.10 He has 
three children: a daughter born in 1981, and two sons born in 1987 and 2001, 
respectively.11 
 
Military Service 
 
During his period of military service, Applicant was awarded the Meritorious 
Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal (five awards), the Army Achievement 
Medal (five awards), the Meritorious Unit Commendation, the Army Good Conduct 
Medal (six awards), the National Defense Service Medal (two awards), the Kosovo 
Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Southwest Asia 
Service Medal (three awards), the Non-Commissioned Officer’s Professional 
Development Ribbon (three awards), the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service 
Ribbon (three awards), the Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia), the Kuwait 
Liberation Medal (Kuwait), the Silver German Army Marksmanship Badge, and the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization Medal.12 Applicant was deployed to Saudi Arabia in 
support of Operation Desert Storm from August 1990 until July 1991; to Iraq in support 
of Operation Provide Comfort from April 1992 until October 1992; and to Macedonia in 
support of the Bosnian Relief Mission from November 1999 until April 2000.13 
 
Financial Considerations 
From 2004 until August 2007, Applicant conducted a part-time business (on 
weekends) selling brand-name shoes, jerseys, and other apparel in two adjacent stalls 
at a flea market. He made an estimated $15,000 per year at the flea market. At some 
point in early to mid-2007, there was a burglary at the flea market and merchandise 
worth a substantial amount was stolen from him. Applicant’s request that the flea market 
owner file an insurance claim was rejected. Thereafter, Applicant was of the opinion that 
the flea market owner considered Applicant to be a nuisance. In August 2007, Applicant 
was arrested by the sheriff and charged with felony violation of intellectual property, 
otherwise known as selling counterfeit goods. His merchandise, with an estimated retail 
value of $60,000, was confiscated. When Applicant’s attorney presented documentation 
that the merchandise was legitimate, and not counterfeit, the charges were dismissed.  
Nevertheless, his confiscated merchandise was never returned.14 Because the

merchandise had been confiscated, and Applicant was unable to sell it, he could not 
pay for the merchandise that he had already charged to his credit card. 
From late 2006 until March 2008, Applicant also conducted a business operating 
an automobile repair shop with the assistance of one full-time employee. He had hoped 
the business would become a profitable endeavor, but with the deteriorating economy, it 
did not. Instead, Applicant considered it to be a “money pit” and he shut it down.15 
Applicant started experiencing financial difficulties in 2007 with the loss of his flea 
market business and inventory, the lack of success and eventual closure of his auto 
repair shop business, and the deteriorating economy.16 He prioritized his bills, 
addressing his personal bills, then his business bills with his regular wages, and paid his 
employee’s salary from his savings. That process continued until he had no money 
left.17 As a result, while his personal accounts remained current, his business accounts 
became delinquent. Applicant contacted his creditors in an effort to resolve the debts 
and establish repayment arrangements. Some of his creditors or collection agents 
initially agreed to work with him, but they purportedly ultimately demanded an initial 
large lump payment or the entire balance immediately rather than agreeing to 
repayment plans.18 Applicant simply did not have the capital to comply with his creditors’ 
demands.19 
The SOR initially identified eight purportedly continuing delinquencies as 
reflected by credit reports from March 201320 and July 2014,21 totaling approximately 
$130,812. With the withdrawal of SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.d., the remaining six accounts total 
approximately $82,756. Those remaining debts listed in the SOR and their respective 
current status, according to the credit reports, other evidence in the case file, and 
Applicant’s admissions regarding the same, are described below. 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): There is a personal credit card used for Applicant’s flea market 
business with a credit limit of $13,000 and a past-due balance (including penalties and 
interest) of $16,417 that was charged off.22 Applicant purportedly approached the 
creditor in an attempt to set up a repayment plan, but the creditor would only agree to 
do so if Applicant first made a lump-sum payment of one-half of the remaining balance.

The creditor attempted to obtain a judgment against Applicant, but the matter was 
dismissed. Applicant or his attorney continued to make various repayment offers, but 
each such offer was rejected without an initial lump-sum payment.23 Eventually, the 
creditor stopped pursuing the issue. Applicant disputed the account, and while it was on 
his July 2014 credit report,24 it has been removed from three more recent December 
2014 credit reports.25  
 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): There is a telephone account with an unpaid balance of 
approximately $726 that was placed for collection and transferred or sold to a debt 
purchasing company.26 Applicant explained that he had been a customer of the 
company since 2001. Over the years, the company had made a number of unauthorized 
changes to his account. In 2009, in acknowledgement of those unauthorized changes, 
the company retention control department granted Applicant a 23 percent discount to 
remain in effect so long as Applicant remained a customer. One day in 2013, while he 
was on the road, Applicant’s telephone died, and he had to purchase a new one. He 
agreed to add a two-year plan for the new telephone to his existing account without any 
other changes.  However, upon receiving his first bill the following month, he noted that 
the discount had been removed. Applicant disputed the action with several 
representatives at different levels of authority at the company, but they refused to 
restore the discount. Applicant informed the last representative that he considered the 
action removing the discount to be a voiding of the contract. He returned the telephone 
to the company and cancelled his service with them. He received a refund of $99 for the 
telephone. The final bill was for cancellation fees associated with the telephone. 
Applicant disputed the account with the credit reporting agencies.27 While the account 
was on his July 2014 credit report,28 and it remains on his December 2014 credit report 
from the same credit reporting agency,29 it has been removed from two other December 
2014 credit reports.30  
 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): There was a business loan from an investment group for his 
automobile repair shop in the disputed amount of $19,000 or $24,000 for which 
Applicant made monthly payments of $902 for nine months before being unable to

continue doing so in mid-2008.31 Applicant purportedly contacted the lender repeatedly, 
most recently in May 2014, in an effort to restructure the loan, but his efforts were 
rejected. It would not accept any amount less than the expected monthly payment.32 
The account was placed for collection and charged off.33 Somehow the past-due 
balance increased to $42,139 by March 2013.34 It increased to $50,909 by November 
2014.35 The account was scheduled to be removed from Applicant’s credit report in 
March 2015.36 The account does not appear in two of his December 2014 credit 
reports.37  
 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): There is a personal credit card account used for both personal 
charges and for the automobile repair shop with a past-due balance of $17,229 that was 
placed for collection and charged off in January 2007.38 Applicant contends he made 
several efforts to lower his monthly payments, but those efforts were rejected.39 The 
account does not appear in his July 2014 credit report40 or in any of his December 2014 
credit reports.41  
 
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): There is another credit card account from the same credit card 
company used for both personal charges and for the automobile repair shop with a 
past-due balance of $6,096 that was placed for collection and charged off in March 
2008.42 Applicant contends he made several efforts to lower his monthly payments, but 
those efforts were rejected.43 The account does not appear in his July 2014 credit 
report44 or in any of his December 2014 credit reports.45

 Applicant has steadfastly stated that the loan was for approximately $19,000, but his March 2013 credit

 (SOR ¶ 1.h.): There is an unspecified account with an account processing 
company with an unpaid balance of $187 that was placed for collection in March 2009.46 
During his April 2013 interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM), Applicant claimed to have no knowledge of the account, but 
indicated he would contact the creditor immediately to determine what the account was 
about and satisfy it.47 He subsequently disputed the account.48 The account does not 
appear in his July 2014 credit report49 or in any of his December 2014 credit reports.50 
 
On July 10, 2015, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement (PFS) that 
reflected a net monthly income of $6,516 and total monthly expenses of $5,382.95. That 
left him with an estimated monthly surplus of $1,133.05 available for discretionary 
savings or spending.51 However, as he pointed out, he chose not to include his wife’s 
monthly net income in his PFS as she handles her own “set of bills” including family 
groceries.52 Applicant’s wife’s approximate gross annual salary is $33,000.53 Applicant’s 
PFS also indicated that he has $3,500 in savings, and $65,000 in a 401(k).54  
 
Applicant has repeatedly professed to the OPM investigator in April 2013, in his 
Answer to the SOR in January 2015, and during the hearing in June 2015, that he was 
willing to settle his accounts no matter how long it takes. Yet, despite a substantial 
monthly remainder available for discretionary spending, since about 2008, he has 
essentially made no payments on his SOR-related delinquent “business” accounts. He 
repeatedly referred to his intentions and purported actual efforts to resolve his 
delinquent accounts and creditor demands for large payments, but he failed to submit 
any documentation either from himself or from creditors or collection agents to support 
his contentions. He admitted that no such efforts took place following his OPM 
interview.55 During the hearing, Applicant stated he is still willing to pay his debts off 
because he has a moral responsibility to do so.56  
 
In 1997 or 1998, Applicant engaged the professional services of a financial 
counseling service to assist him in consolidating his bills to lower his monthly

Other than consolidation guidance, there is no evidence of financial counseling related 
to the handling of delinquent accounts, debt resolution, budgeting, etc. 
 
Character References 
 
 A retired director of the company for which Applicant works hired Applicant. He 
claimed he worked Applicant and his other subordinates hard for the benefit of the 
company, leaving them little time for their spiritual, financial, or personal needs. 
Applicant’s technical expertise was extraordinary and matched by only one other 
individual in the Army. He characterized Applicant in highly favorable terms: very 
trustworthy, and super honest.58 The director of the military network (and an Army 
Colonel who has known Applicant for over 12 years) for which Applicant works, noted 
that Applicant is a highly qualified, well-suited, self-starter, who is highly deserving of 
the continued opportunity to be a tremendous asset.59 The chief technology officer in an 
office of an assistant secretary of the Army has worked on several projects with 
Applicant, and he has characterized Applicant as loyal, responsible, trustworthy, and 
ethical. He noted that Applicant had explained to him “the actions [Applicant] has taken 
to remedy these credit issues.”  He urges that Applicant be “permitted to resolve his 
credit issues over time and that he retain his clearance.”60 Other coworkers and friends 
are equally supportive of Applicant’s application, and they, too, have only sterling 
recommendations for him.61 
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”62 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”63

When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”64 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.65  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”66 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no

in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Commencing in 2007, various accounts were placed for collection or 
charged off, and today – eight years later – they remain unpaid. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) 
apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”68 In addition, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply if “the individual has a reasonable 
                                                          
68
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
 
11 
                                      
 
basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem 
and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. AG ¶ 20(d) minimally applies. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), 
and 20(e) do not apply. Applicant’s financial problems started in 2007 when his flea 
market merchandise was initially stolen in mid-2007, and again in August 2007, when 
an estimated $60,000 worth of merchandise was confiscated, but never returned. 
Things got worse when he was forced to close his automobile repair shop in 2008. 
Applicant made a strategic decision regarding his accounts: he prioritized his bills, 
addressing his personal bills, then his business bills with his regular wages, and paid an 
employee’s salary from his savings. That process continued until he had no money left. 
As a result, while his personal accounts remained current, his business accounts 
became delinquent. Applicant contended that he contacted his creditors in an effort to 
resolve the debts and establish repayment arrangements. Some of his creditors or 
collection agents purportedly demanded an initial large lump-sum payment or the entire 
balance immediately rather than agreeing to repayment plans. Applicant simply did not 
have the capital to comply with his creditors’ demands. As noted above, Applicant failed 
to submit any documentation to support either his efforts or his creditors’ demands. 
Applicant acknowledged that he made no efforts to resolve his delinquent 
“business” accounts after his OPM interview in 2013. Instead, Applicant disputed the 
accounts with the credit reporting agencies. Applicant’s relatively successful efforts in 
disputing the delinquent accounts do not support his contentions that they were either 
not his accounts or that they were erroneous balances. Considering the age of the 
delinquent accounts, and the period of Applicant’s inaction or refusal to make any 
repayments since those accounts were generally charged off in 2007, 2008, or 2009, it 
appears that the accounts fell off Applicant’s credit reports because of the age of the 
debts, the statute of limitations had simply run out for most of them, or a combination of 
both. Delaying the resolution of delinquent debts and allowing them to become 
uncollectible under the state statute of limitations, does not reflect a good-faith 
resolution of those debts. 
Applicant acknowledged that in 1997 or 1998 he had received some debt 
consolidation counseling to lower his monthly payments. There was no indication that 
any accounts were delinquent at that time. Other than that consolidation guidance, there 
is no evidence of financial counseling related to the handling of delinquent accounts, 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

debt resolution, or budgeting. While all of Applicant’s newer accounts appear to be 
current, he has done little if anything to resolve the “business” accounts alleged in the 
SOR. Applicant clearly has $1,133 available each month, in addition to whatever his 
wife may have available, for discretionary savings or spending, in addition to some 
savings and 401(k) monies available. Yet, rather than addressing his delinquent debts 
in a responsible manner, over the years, he simply ignored them, and continues to do 
so, despite his repeated promises to take positive action.69 Applicant’s actions under the 
circumstances continue to cast substantial doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment.70 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He apparently 
is a gifted, highly valued, hard worker. He is also a retired, decorated combat warrior 
with three deployments. His superiors and coworkers characterized him as loyal, 
responsible, trustworthy, and ethical. Despite some bad business experiences, Applicant 
managed to keep his personal accounts current. In the very beginning of his financial 
difficulties, Applicant addressed some of his business responsibilities by paying salaries 
out of his personal accounts.

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

13 
                                      
 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial 
than the mitigating evidence. While, in the beginning of his financial problems, Applicant 
addressed some of his business responsibilities by paying salaries out of his personal 
accounts, at some point in 2008 he simply stopped doing so, claiming he ran out of 
funds to continue making any “business” payments. Whether they were personal 
accounts or business accounts in this instance is irrelevant for the accounts were 
personal accounts used for business purposes or they were mingled accounts used for 
both purposes. Applicant claimed he made repeated offers to resolve the delinquent 
accounts, but he failed to submit any documentation to support his contentions. He 
claimed he disputed the accounts with the credit reporting agencies and that the 
accounts were removed from his credit reports. Once again, he failed to submit any 
documentation to support his contentions as to why the accounts dropped off his credit 
reports.  
One of Applicant’s character references noted that Applicant had explained to 
him the actions Applicant had taken to remedy his credit issues, and he urged that 
Applicant be permitted to resolve those issues over time. It is unclear what Applicant’s 
explanations to his colleague might have been. One thing is clear, however, and that is 
that Applicant has had approximately seven years to start resolving his delinquent 
“business” debts, and he has done essentially nothing to do so, even with one of those 
debts.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:71 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.

14 
                                      
 
Applicant has demonstrated an essentially negative track record of voluntary 
debt reduction and elimination efforts, generally ignoring his delinquent debts until the 
statute of limitations lapsed on them. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with 
substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security 
clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security 
concerns arising from his financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 
2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   For APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Withdrawn 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    Withdrawn 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.h:    Against Applicant 
      
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
