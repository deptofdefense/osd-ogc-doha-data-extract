HEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Department of Defense’s (DoD) intent to deny his eligibility 
for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. Applicant owed more than 
$25,000 in federal taxes, had a foreclosure on his home, a vehicle repossessed, and 
had nine additional charged-off, collection, or delinquent accounts, which totaled more 
than $14,000. The mortgage obligation is no longer owed and he is paying his tax 
obligation. He has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Clearance is 
granted. 
 
History of the Case 
 
 Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,1 on September 2, 
2014, the DoD issued a Statement of Reason (SOR) detailing financial considerations 
                                                          
1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD 
on September 1, 2006.

security concerns. DoD adjudicators could not find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s security clearance. On September 18, 
2014, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On January 16, 2015, I 
was assigned the case. On January 28, 2015, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing for a hearing to be convened on February 
10, 2015. On February 3, 2015, that hearing was cancelled due to a lack of timely 
notification.  
 
On April 29, 2015, a Notice of Hearing was issued for a hearing convened on 
May 7, 2015. At the hearing, Government’s Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 7 and Applicant’s 
Exhibit A were admitted without objection. Applicant testified at the hearing. The record 
was held open to allow Applicant to submit additional information. Additional material 
(Ex. B) was submitted and admitted into the record without objection. On May 15, 2015, 
DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.). 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he admitted his home was in foreclosure, that 
he owed Federal income taxes, which were filed in 2009 for Chapter 13 bankruptcy 
protection, and that two accounts had been charged off. He denies the remaining SOR 
allegations. His admissions are incorporated as facts. After a thorough review of the 
pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
 Applicant is a 56-year-old aircraft painter who has worked for a defense 
contractor since September 2008, and seeks to obtain a security clearance. His gross 
pay is approximately $3,000 every two weeks. (Ex. 2) From August 1977 through 
August 1980, he served in the U.S. Marine Corps, honorably separating as a corporal 
(E-4). From August 1987 through August 1994, he served in the U.S. Army, honorably 
separating as a staff sergeant (E-6). (Ex. 2, Tr. 57) 
 
 Before obtaining his current job, Applicant was an independent contractor. (Tr. 
27) Three individuals he hired provided him with false social security numbers. This 
resulted in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) claiming the three individuals were 
employees and not independent contractors. Additional taxes were assessed against 
Applicant for tax years 2005 through 2008, and also tax year 2011. (Ex. A, Ex. 2, Tr. 25) 
All tax years except for 2006 are now paid.  
 
 In October 2013, Applicant contacted the IRS concerning his Federal income tax 
debt. (Ex. 2) In June 2014, he paid the IRS $150. (Ex. B) In July 2014, he established a 
repayment plan and started paying the IRS $550 every two months. (Tr. 25) He made 
payments in: July 2014, September 2014, November 2014, and January 2015. (Ex. B) 
He was entitled to a tax refund for tax year 2013. (Ex. A) That refund was intercepted 
and $1,148 was applied to his 2011 tax liability, which paid all arrearage he owed for 
that tax year. (Ex. A) The additional $68 of the refund was applied to his 2006 taxes, 
leaving a balance owed of $8,771. As of April 2015, a 2014 refund of $862 was applied 
to his 2006 tax liability, reducing the balance to $7,919. (Ex. A) 
 
3 
 
  
 In August 2009, Applicant sought Chapter 13, Wage Earner’s Plan bankruptcy 
protection. (Ex. 2) At the time of filing, his average monthly income was $5,000, his 
wife’s average monthly income was $1,263, and their average monthly expenses were 
$3,833. (Ex. 6, Tr. 36) The net income was approximately $2,400. (Ex. 6) Applicant’s 
assets were approximately $137,600, of which $124,000 represented his house and his 
2007 pickup. His liabilities were $154,500, with the house and pickup accounting for 
approximately $127,000 of the liability. Excluding the house and the truck, he had 
approximately $13,600 in assets and $27,000 in liabilities. (Ex. 6) 
 
 Applicant was required to attend financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy. 
(Tr. 43) From August 2009 through May 2012,2 the monthly amount paid to the 
bankruptcy trustee was automatically withheld from his pay. (Ex. 2) In May 2012, he 
could no longer afford the monthly amounts and stopped making payments. The 
bankruptcy was then dismissed.  
 
 During Applicant’s 30 months of payments, he paid approximately $75,000 to the 
bankruptcy trustee. (Ex. 7, Tr. 38) During the Chapter 13, his mortgage company3 
received approximately $50,000. (Ex. 2, Ex. 7) Approximately $11,000 was paid on his 
pickup during the bankruptcy and approximately $1,685 was paid to other secured 
creditors.4 (Ex. 7) 
  
 In March 2007, Applicant purchased a $28,304 pickup truck and made the $675 
monthly payments. (Ex. 3) In 2011, directly after the dismissal of his bankruptcy, he 
voluntarily surrendered possession of the pickup. (Ex. 2, Tr. 43) A $7,332 (SOR 1.j) 
debt was incurred following the surrender of the vehicle. He indicated he received a 
letter from the creditor informing him that after the truck was sold he owed $3,500. (Tr. 
42, 44) He has not paid the debt because he was working on addressing the home 
foreclosure and was making tax payments first. (Ex. 2) 
 On Applicant’s February 2013 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations 
Processing (e-QIP), he listed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed in August 2009, that he 
owed $1,800 in Federal income tax, and that he had defaulted on a home loan and on a 
truck loan. He also indicated a medical debt had been turned over to a collection firm. 
(Ex. 1) 
                                                          
2 The bankruptcy documents indicate Applicant’s case was dismissed in November 2011 and not May 
2012 as claimed by Applicant. (Ex. 7) The amount paid during the bankruptcy is not in dispute. 
 
3 The record fails to indicate the date Applicant purchased his home, however his February 2013 credit 
report indicates he had a $61,600 mortgage opened in March 2006. (Ex. 5) From the record it is unclear if 
this was the initial mortgage company or the mortgage debt had been transferred from a different 
mortgage company. 
  
4 The trustee paid $1,865 to secured creditors of which there were four. The two secured furniture 
accounts (SOR 1.f and SOR 1.g) totaled $1,665. Applicant’s bankruptcy filing shows the county tax 
assessor submitted a $3,200 secured claim and a department store submitted a $1,000 secured claim. 
There is no indication which of the four secured claims was paid by the $1,685 payment made by the 
bankruptcy trustee. (Ex. 6) 
 
4 
 
 In March and April 2013, Applicant was interviewed about his finances and 
completed a Personal Subject Interview (PSI). (Ex. 2) He was asked about the $339 
(SOR 1.a) and $862 (SOR 1.b) medical collection accounts, which he had 
acknowledged on his e-QIP. He had listed the $694 delinquent medical account (SOR 
1.c). (Ex. 1) He stated the $375 collection account (SOR 1.e) was his wife’s car note 
and that he was never on the note. (Ex.2) The four remaining SOR debts were not 
discussed during the interviews. Those debts were: a $936 medical collection account 
(SOR 1.d), a $1,845 cable bill collection account (SOR 1.i), and a $473 television 
service provider collection account (SOR 1.m). (Ex. 2, Ex. 4, Tr. 33) 
 
 During the interview, Applicant discussed the two furniture charged-off accounts 
(SOR 1.f, $397 and SOR 1.g, $1,268). (Ex. 2) He indicated he contacted the furniture 
company and due to a reorganization of the company following the company’s 
bankruptcy, the creditor did not know where Applicant should send payment. (Ex. 2) As 
previously stated, the two furniture accounts had been listed as secured claims in his 
bankruptcy. (Tr. 35) 
 
In April 2014, Applicant answered written financial interrogatories. (Tr. 2) At that 
time, he asserted he had returned the cable company’s equipment (SOR 1.i, $1,845) 
and no longer owed anything. (Ex. 2) In September 2014, he asserted he had returned 
the equipment to the television service provider (SOR 1.m, $473). (SOR Answer) He 
was unsure about other delinquent accounts, that they might be medical accounts, and 
stated he would be contacting the creditors. (Ex. 2) Applicant and his daughter were in 
an automobile accident caused by another individual. (Tr. 33) He has and had medical 
insurance through his current employer, but for some reason the four medical bills were 
never paid. (Tr. 34) 
 In July 2014, Applicant’s Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure was approved and the 
$97,200 lien on the property held by the mortgage company (SOR 1.h) was released. 
(SOR Answer) 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
5 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 Adjudicative Guideline (AG) ¶ 18 articulates the security concerns relating to 
financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
Additionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
safeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect 
of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  
 
6 
 
A person’s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is 
uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed 
upon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an 
applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk 
that is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be 
debt free, but is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant has a history of financial problems. In 2009, he had to resort to 
bankruptcy protection. He had a home foreclosure, a vehicle repossessed, and unpaid 
taxes, all of which totaled more than $135,000. Disqualifying Conditions AG ¶ 19(a), 
“inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting 
financial obligations,” apply.  
 
 Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20 are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant was a self-employed contractor in the building trade. In August 2009, 
his income in the construction industry had dropped to the point where he sought 
bankruptcy protection. His monthly net income was approximately $2,400. Excluding his 
home and pickup truck, he had approximately $13,600 in assets and $27,000 in 
liabilities. The plan lasted for 30 months before he could no longer afford to make the 
required monthly payments. During his bankruptcy, he paid approximately $75,000 to 
the trustee.  
 
7 
 
 During the course of the bankruptcy, Applicant’s mortgage company received 
approximately $50,000. In July 2014, a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure was approved and 
the $97,200 lien on the property held by the mortgage company was released. He owes 
no money on this debt. I find for him on this debt.  
 
 In March 2007, Applicant purchased a $28,304 pickup truck and made the $675 
monthly payments through November 2011. In the 29 months from the purchase, in 
March 2007, until the start of the bankruptcy, in August 2009, he paid more than 
$19,000. During his bankruptcy, approximately $11,000 more was paid on his pickup. 
Following the repossession, the creditor told him he owes $3,500. That debt remains 
unpaid. He has not paid the debt because he was addressing the home foreclosure and 
was making tax payments first. I find for him on this debt. 
 
 During the bankruptcy, the trustee paid $1,865 to secured creditors of which 
there were four. The two secured furniture accounts totaled $1,665. It is uncertain how 
much was paid on these furniture accounts. When Applicant contacted the company, 
the creditor did not know where he should sent payment on these two accounts due to a 
company reorganization following the company’s bankruptcy. I find for him on these two 
debts. 
 
When Applicant was a self-employed contractor, he hired three individuals he 
treated as independent contractors. When the social security numbers they provided 
were determined to be fraudulent the IRS assessed additional federal income tax. He 
has been making regular payments on the tax debt. As of April 2015, he has reduced 
his tax obligation to $7,919 and is continuing to make payments on the debt. I find for 
him on his tax liability.  
 
 Applicant and his daughter were involved in a vehicle accident that was not his 
fault. Even though he had medical insurance at the time, and still does, four of the 
medical debts have not been paid. He returned the equipment to the cable company 
and to the television service provider. 
 
Under AG ¶ 20(a), Applicant=s financial problems were contributed to by the IRS 
disallowing his claim that his of workers were independent contractors and not 
employees. Paying $75,000 over the 30 months of his bankruptcy shows good faith. AG 
¶ 20(a) and AG & 20(b) apply. 
 
Under AG & 20(c) and & 20(d), Applicant is paying his tax liability, and is no 
longer liable on the mortgage. He received financial counseling, appears to be living 
within his means, and meeting his current financial obligations. AG & 20(c) and & 20(d) 
apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
 
8 
 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred were not the 
type that indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules 
and regulations. Money was not spent frivolously. The SOR debts were not incurred on 
luxuries, but were for medical treatment, taxes, a home, and a truck.  
. 
The largest obligation was a mortgage that Applicant no longer owes. The next 
largest debt was for taxes, which he is paying and has reduced to approximately 
$8,000. The third largest debt followed the repossession of his truck, which is not a very 
large obligation. He had paid more than $19,000 before his truck was repossessed. He 
asserts the creditor says he owes $3,500 on the debt.  
 
Applicant paid the bankruptcy trustee more than $75,000 over a thirty-month 
period. Paying for this period of time gives me confidence he will continue making his 
tax payments in a timely manner. It also gives me confidence he will address his other 
delinquent debts when he is able to do so. He first concentrated on the home 
foreclosure and his tax debt.  
 
The issue is not simply whether all his debts are paid—it is whether his financial 
circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & 
2(a)(1).) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

 Paragraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.m:  For Applicant 
 
 Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
