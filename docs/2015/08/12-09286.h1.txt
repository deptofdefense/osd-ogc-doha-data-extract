DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). Clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 15, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing 
security concerns under Guideline F. This action was taken under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
continue Applicant’s security clearance. On February 3, 2015, Applicant answered the 
SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on March 30, 2015. The 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on April 
27, 2015, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on May 14, 2015.

At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 
through 6. Applicant testified and offered Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through D. The 
record of the proceeding was left open until June 15, 2015, to provide Applicant the 
opportunity to submit additional matters. He submitted additional documents that were 
marked as AE E through L. All exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. 
DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 21, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has been working 
for that contractor since April 2012. He graduated from high school in 1988. He served 
on active duty in the Navy from 1989 to 2009, attained the grade of petty officer first 
class (E-6), and retired with an honorable discharge. He married in 1994 and divorced 
in 2009. He has two children, ages 3 and 21. He held a security clearance in the Navy 
for about 20 years.1 
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant had 26 delinquent debts, totaling about $73,065 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.z). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted seven allegations (SOR 
¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.p, 1.r, 1.s, and 1.w), totaling about $9,946. His admissions are 
incorporated as findings of fact.2  
 
Applicant attributed his financial problems to his divorce and his ex-wife’s 
financial irresponsibility. Because he spent a significant amount of time at sea while in 
the Navy, he gave his then wife a power of attorney and she handled their finances. She 
opened a number of accounts in his name without his knowledge, but he acknowledged 
that he was responsible for those accounts. During his Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM) interview in June 2012, Appellant indicated that he was not aware of most of the 
delinquent debts when he completed his security clearance application and only 
became aware of them when he later applied for a car loan. In about 2012, he started 
disputing many of the debts on his credit report because he had no knowledge of them. 
He was also unemployed for about a year after he retired from the Navy.3 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a – charged-off account in the amount of $6,367. This was a vehicle 
loan that was opened in May 2012 and had a date of last activity of October 2012. 
Applicant cosigned this loan for a friend who soon thereafter defaulted. In May 2015, 
Applicant settled this debt for $900 and entered into a repayment plan with the creditor. 
Under that plan, he agreed to pay $79 every other week until the settlement amount is

paid. He authorized the creditor to debit his bank account automatically for the 
scheduled payments. He made two payments before the hearing.4  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b – collection account in the amount of $900. This account was opened 
in January 2014 and had a date of last activity of January 2013. Applicant testified that 
he thought he had paid this debt and disputed it through the credit reporting bureaus. 
This debt no longer appears on his most recent credit reports.5 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c – charged-off account in the amount of $504. This account was 
opened in January 2008 and had a date of last activity of March 2008. Applicant 
testified that the creditor agreed to remove this account from his credit reports. This 
debt no longer appears on his most recent credit reports.6 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d – collection account in the amount of $249. This utility account had a 
date of last activity of March 2009. Applicant testified that he discussed this debt with 
the creditor the week before the hearing, acknowledged he owed this debt, and 
indicated he would pay it. In his post-hearing submission, he provided a receipt showing 
it was paid.7 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.o – state tax liens totaling $26,443. These 11 tax liens are 
from State A where Applicant resided while serving in the military. The tax liens were 
filed in 2009 and 2011. He disputes the tax liens because he was a legal resident of 
State B while in the military and was exempt from paying income taxes to State A under 
the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. He provided a sample of his military leave and 
earning statements from 2000 to 2008 that confirmed he was paying income taxes to 
State B. He also testified that he did not own land in State A. His ex-wife worked in 
State A, but they filed separate state income tax returns. He indicated that he gave a 
copy of his DD 214 to the tax authorities in State A to establish that he was not a 
resident of that state. At the time of the hearing, he believed State A was still 
investigating his claim that he was exempt from its state income taxes. Two credit 
reporting agencies have removed the tax liens from his most recent credit reports.8

he did own land in State A from 2003 to 2006. It is very unlikely that property taxes for those three years 
could account for the 11 alleged tax liens. Applicant stopped living in State A about two years after he 
retired from the military, but he was unemployed for most of that period.

SOR ¶ 1.p – judgment in the amount of $737. This judgment was filed against 
Applicant in June 2008. Applicant testified that he contacted the creditor to arrange a 
repayment plan, but had not yet made any payments under that plan.9 
 
SOR ¶ 1.q – collection account in the amount of $499. This television service 
account had a date of last activity of January 2009. Applicant claimed he never had an 
account with this television service provider. He disputed this debt, and it no longer 
appears on his most recent credit reports.10 
 
SOR ¶ 1.r – charged-off account in the amount of $512. This account was 
opened in January 2008 and had a date of last activity of March 2008. He testified that 
he paid this debt in 2012. He did not provide documents confirming that payment. This 
debt no longer appears on his most recent credit reports.11 
 
SOR ¶ 1.s – charged-off account in the amount of $628. This account was 
opened in June 2007 and had a date of last activity of July 2007. Applicant testified the 
he believed this debt was paid and disputed it with the credit reporting agencies. This 
debt no longer appears on his most recent credit reports.12 
  
SOR ¶¶ 1.t and 1.u – collection accounts in the amounts of $135 and $27. These 
are medical accounts that had dates of last activity of January 2009 and January 2010. 
He and his oldest daughter are covered by the military medical system. He had no 
knowledge of these debts and disputed them. They no longer appear on his most recent 
credit reports.13 
 
SOR ¶ 1.v – collection account in the amount of $628. This account was opened 
in February 2009 and had a date of last activity of February 2011. Applicant had no 
knowledge of this debt and disputed it. This debt no longer appears on his most recent 
credit reports.14 
 
SOR ¶ 1.w – charged-off account in the amount of $553. This account was 
opened in February 2006 and had a date of last activity of July 2006. Applicant testified 
that he paid this debt and disputed it through the credit reporting bureaus. This debt no 
longer appears on his most recent credit reports.15

SOR ¶ 1.x – charged-off account in the amount of $165. This account was 
opened in October 2006 and had a date of last activity of March 2012. Applicant 
testified that this was an administrative fee he incurred when he dropped an online 
college course. He stated that he paid this debt in 2012 and disputed it. This debt no 
longer appears on his most recent credit reports.16 
 
SOR ¶ 1.y – charged-off account in the amount of $34,666. This account was 
opened in October 2006 and had a date of last activity of March 2003. This debt was a 
bank loan for a vehicle that his ex-wife purchased without his knowledge. He disputed 
this debt, and it was removed from his most recent credit reports. He testified that he 
currently had an account with that bank that was in good standing.17 
 
SOR ¶ 1.z – collection account in the amount of $52. This account was assigned 
for collection in April 2012. Applicant testified that he had no knowledge of this account 
and disputed it. This debt no longer appears on his most credit reports.18 
 
In about 2008, Applicant hired a debt-management company to assist him in 
resolving his delinquent debts. He paid that company about $100 a month. After a year 
with the company, he was disappointed with the progress it was making in resolving the 
debts. He terminated his relationship with that company and began resolving the debts 
himself.19 
 
Applicant’s annual salary is $82,000. He testified that he receives about $1,300 
per month in retirement pay and $863 in disability pay. In his post-hearing submission, 
he provided a budget that reflected his total net monthly income was $6,621 and his 
total monthly expenses were $4,640, which left him a net monthly remainder of $1,981. 
He testified that he recently made a $17,000 payment to pay off one of his vehicles.20 
 
In the Navy, Applicant was awarded four Navy Achievement Medals and six 
Good Conduct Medals. His work performance evaluations reflect that he received high 
grades in each performance category over the past several years. His supervisor wrote 
that Applicant was an asset to the company, and the company was lucky to have him 
working on their team.21

Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information Within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, in reaching a decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
 
7 
 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  
 
 Applicant accumulated delinquent debts that he was unable to pay for an 
extended period. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. 
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
 
8 
 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Starting in 2009, Applicant was unemployed for about one year after retiring from 
the Navy. In 2009, he also went through a divorce. His ex-wife was financially 
irresponsible. She opened a number of accounts in his name without his knowledge and 
then defaulted. He only became aware of delinquent accounts when he later applied for a 
vehicle loan. These were conditions beyond his control that contributed to his financial 
problems. Upon learning of the delinquent debts, he hired a debt-management company 
to assist him in resolving these problems. He later became dissatisfied with the debt- 
management company and began resolving the debts himself. Since then, he has 
successfully disputed many of the debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.c and 1.q-1.z). He also appears to 
have a legitimate basis for his pending dispute of the state tax liens (SOR ¶¶ 1.e-1.o). He 
paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d and entered into a repayment plan for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a. 
He has yet to finalize arrangements to resolve the $737 judgment in SOR ¶ 1.p. He has 
acted responsibly in methodically resolving his delinquent debts. AG ¶ 20(b) fully applies. 
AG ¶ 20(e) applies to the disputed debts. 
 
 Applicant’s financial situation is stable. His delinquent debts are being resolved. 
They were the result of unusual circumstances that are unlikely to recur and no longer 
cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
and 20(c) apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
 
9 
 
 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       
My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in this whole-person analysis. 
Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some 
warrant additional comment.  
Applicant served honorably in the Navy for 20 years He is a valued employee of 
his current company. He has held a security clearance for many years without incident. 
His delinquent debts arose from his ex-wife’s financial irresponsibility. Although 
Applicant has some debts that remain unresolved, he has shown that his is committed 
to resolving them. He is financially stable and is meeting his current financial 
commitments.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as 
to his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant mitigated the security 
concerns under the financial considerations guideline.  
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive 
are:          
 
   Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  For Applicant  
 
   Subparagraphs 1.a-1.z:  For Applicant  
 
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Clearance is granted.
