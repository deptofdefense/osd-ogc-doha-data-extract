GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 30, 2014, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP).1  On December 5, 2014, 
the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel 
Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended and modified (Regulation); DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines 
for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the DOD 
on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under 
the Directive. The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators could not make an

 Item 2 (e-QIP, dated April 30, 2014).

affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for occupying a public trust 
position to support a contract with the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. In a written statement, notarized on December 22, 2014, Applicant responded to the 
SOR allegations and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a 
hearing.2 A complete copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was 
provided to Applicant on May 20, 2015, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a 
period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in 
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished 
a copy of the Directive, as well as the Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant 
received the FORM on June 5, 2015. The response was due on July 5, 2015. Applicant 
submitted information in response to the FORM, to which Department Counsel did not 
object, and they have been marked as Applicant Items (AI) A through AI D.3 The case 
was assigned to me on August 12, 2015. 
  
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.h.) of the SOR. Applicant’s 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to 
retain his eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract with the 
DOD. He has never served in the U.S. military.4 He is a 1999 high school graduate with 
substantial attendance at a university, but no degree.5 Applicant underwent a security 
clearance investigation but was apparently denied eligibility in August 2013 for reasons 
that were never disclosed to him.6 It is unclear when Applicant joined his current 
employer in an unspecified position, but he apparently did so between May 2014 and 
June 2015. Applicant was married in June 2010 and separated in January 2013.7 He 
has no biological children.

Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about May 2004 
when he was forced to withdraw from his university due to an inability to pay his living 
expenses.8 Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to his youth and fiscal 
irresponsibility, as well as to his periods of unemployment.9 He was voluntarily 
unemployed from September 2005 until September 2008, residing in another country 
while supported by his fiancé and caring for his stepdaughter; involuntarily unemployed 
from March 2010 until February 2013, supported by his savings and his parents and 
playing video games, watching television, and practicing the guitar; and involuntarily 
unemployed from November 2013 until December 2013, supported by his savings and 
playing video games, watching television, and practicing the guitar.10 As a result of 
those issues, Applicant asserts that he had insufficient money to maintain his monthly 
student loan payments. As a result, various accounts became delinquent and were 
placed for collection. Applicant reported his student loan delinquencies in his e-QIP.11 
The SOR identified eight delinquent debts that had been placed for collection, as 
reflected by a May 2014 credit report.12 Those eight debts total approximately $31,072. 
Those allegations and their respective current status, according to the credit report, 
other evidence submitted by the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments 
regarding same, are described below. 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): This is a cable television account with an outstanding and past-due 
balance of $361 that was placed for collection in 2011.13 During his interview with an 
investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in May 2014, 
Applicant claimed he was unaware of the account. He stated that he would find out 
about it and if it is valid, he would make arrangements to pay it.14 The record is silent as 
to what Applicant may have done regarding the account since his interview. The 
account has not been resolved. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b. through 1.g.): These are six student loan accounts with the U.S. 
Department of Education that went into a default status and were placed for collection. 
As of May 2014, the outstanding balances for the student loans were as follows: $5,618 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.), $3,339 (SOR ¶ 1.c.), $4,449 (SOR ¶ 1.d.), $6,768 (SOR ¶ 1.e.), $3,520

(SOR ¶ 1.f.), and $3,483 (SOR ¶ 1.g.).15 Applicant contacted the creditor in February 
2014, and on February 12, 2014, he made a payment of $995. He is now apparently on 
a repayment plan, and has been routinely making monthly payments of $275 since May 
19, 2014 – at least six months before the SOR was issued.16 Applicant’s earlier 
payments were applied to interest, but effective with his November 2014 payment, the 
majority of his payments are applied to principal.17 As of May 20, 2015, the total balance 
due for his student loans was reduced to $24,298.74.18 The accounts are in the process 
of being resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.h.): This is a loan from the university in the approximate amount of 
$1,000 that was to be used for living expenses in 2002 while Applicant attended the 
university. When Applicant withdrew from the university in May 2004, he was aware that 
he should have repaid the loan, but he did not have sufficient funds to do so. The 
account was placed for collection, but it was not reflected in his May 2014 credit 
report.19 By March 2014, the outstanding balance had increased to $3,533.50. In early 
2014, Applicant and the collection agent entered into a repayment arrangement under 
which pre-arranged monthly payments of $147.95 were authorized. A final payment was 
made on April 10, 2015, and the account now has a zero balance.20 The account has 
been resolved. 
Applicant’s May 2014 credit report reflects no other delinquent debts. He has 
committed himself to remaining current on all of his accounts and intends to continue 
paying off his student loans.21 Applicant’s financial problems appear to be under control. 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”22 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. Positions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as “sensitive

positions.”23 “The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is 
that, based on all available information, the person’s loyalty, reliability, and 
trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security.”24 Department of Defense contractor 
personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any 
final unfavorable access determination may be made.25  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a public trust 
position. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”26 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.27  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the

possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  
Furthermore, security clearance determinations, and by inference, public trust 
determinations, should err, if they must, on the side of denials.28 In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems initially arose in 2004 and continued 
for several years thereafter. Accounts became delinquent and were placed for 
collection. Student loans went into a default status. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows

“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”29  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) minimally apply.  Applicant’s 
initial financial problems were attributed to his youth and fiscal irresponsibility, and were 
subsequently exacerbated by periods of voluntary and involuntary unemployment. He 
withdrew from the university without attending to his outstanding university loan or his 
student loans. He avoided his financial responsibilities for three years by remaining 
voluntarily unemployed while residing in a foreign country, supported by his fiancé and 
caring for his stepdaughter. He eventually returned to the workforce, and while he 
apparently maintained his other accounts, his student loans and university loan 
languished unattended. His actions during subsequent periods of involuntary 
unemployment were not spent constructively. Instead, he played video games, watched 
television, and practiced his guitar.30  
 
However, during those periods of irresponsible activity, Applicant seemed to 
morph into a mature, more responsible, adult. In February 2014, Applicant embraced 
the paradigm of fiscal responsibility. He contacted the U.S. Department of Education in 
order to rehabilitate his student loans from a default status, and made his initial 
repayment. At least six months before the SOR was issued, Applicant started his 
routine monthly payments, and those payments continue to this day. In March 2014, he 
turned his attention to his university loan and entered into a repayment arrangement. 
That account has now been fully paid off. Of Appellant’s eight SOR-related accounts, 
one has been resolved, six are in the process of being resolved, and only one minor 
account for $361 remains. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial 
problems are under control. His actions do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.31 
 
                                                          
29
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public 
trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.32   
     
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He 
acknowledged his youth and fiscal irresponsibility led to his financial problems. He 
withdrew from his university and avoided his financial responsibilities by remaining 
voluntarily unemployed while residing in a foreign country. His student loans and 
university loan languished unattended for a number of years even though he had 
eventually gained other employment. During subsequent periods of involuntary 
unemployment, Applicant acted irresponsibly by playing video games, watching 
television, and practicing his guitar, rather than looking for employment or addressing 
his delinquent accounts. 
 
 The mitigating evidence is more substantial and compelling. There is no 
evidence of misuse of information technology systems, mishandling protected 
information, substance abuse, or criminal conduct. In February 2014, Applicant 
apparently matured and finally embraced the paradigm of fiscal responsibility. Of 
Appellant’s eight SOR-related accounts, one has been resolved, six are in the process 
of being resolved, and only one minor account for $361 remains. There are clear 
indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:33 
                                                          
32
 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of ‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.’ However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has ‘. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.’ The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (‘Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.’) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has finally demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction 
and elimination efforts over the last two years, starting to do so months before the SOR 
was issued. This decision should serve as a warning that Applicant’s failure to continue 
his debt resolution efforts pertaining to his delinquent student loans or the actual accrual 
of new delinquent debts will adversely affect his future eligibility for a public trust 
position.34 Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for such a position. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   For APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant

 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant as security officials may continue to monitor his 
finances, this decision, including the warning, should not be interpreted as a conditional eligibility to occupy a public 
trust position to support a contract with DOD. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority 
to attach limiting conditions to an applicant’s public trust position. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 
2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006); ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 
(App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-17410 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0109 at 2 (App. 
Bd. Mar. 1, 2000).

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility to 
occupy a public trust position to support a contract with DOD.  Eligibility is granted.
