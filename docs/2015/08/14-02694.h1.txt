HEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Department of Defense’s (DoD) intent to deny his eligibility 
for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. He owes the IRS $46,000 for 
tax years 2008 through 2013 and has ten collection accounts totaling approximately 
$14,000. He has arranged a payment plan to repay his tax obligation. The financial 
considerations security concerns have been resolved. Clearance is granted.  
 
History of the Case 
 
 Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,1 on October 2, 
2014, the DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing financial considerations 
                                                          
1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD 
on September 1, 2006.

security concerns. DoD adjudicators could not find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s security clearance. On November 5, 
2014, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On January 28, 2015, I 
was assigned the case. On January 28, 2015, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing for the hearing convened on February 11, 
2015. 
 
At the hearing, Government’s Exhibits (Ex) 1, 2, 4 and 52 and Applicant’s Exhibits 
A through C were admitted without objection. Applicant testified at the hearing as did 
three additional character witnesses.3 The record was held open to allow Applicant to 
submit additional information. Additional material (Ex. D through H) was submitted and 
admitted into the record without objection. On February 20, 2015, DOHA received the 
hearing transcript (Tr.). 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he denied having any unpaid federal tax 
returns (SOR 1.c), denies having a cell phone bill (SOR 1.m, $79), and denies a $45 
collection account (SOR 1.n) He admitted the remaining allegations. I incorporate 
Applicant’s admissions as facts. After a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 35-year-old lead aviation mechanic who has worked for a defense 
contractor since February 2010, and seeks to obtain a security clearance. From July 
1998 through December 2003, he honorably served in the U.S. Marine Corps, 
separating as a sergeant (E-5). (Ex. 3, Tr. 20)  
 
Applicant’s co-workers, supervisors, and friends state: Applicant is a hard worker, 
an excellent mechanic, is intelligent, dependable, dedicated, compassionate, honest, 
trustworthy, and has excellent work ethics. Applicant places the value of his employer 
and work assignment at the same level as his personal wants and needs. (Ex. A-1, A-2) 
He has received commendation awards for his superior duty performance both in the 
Marine Corps and in his civilian job. (Ex. A-3, A-4, A-5, A-6, Tr. 57 - 72) 
 
After leaving the Marine Corps, Applicant was unemployed for two months in 
January and February 2004. From April 2004 through May 2007, he was a full-time 
structural mechanic. From May 2007 through August 2007, he was a full-time flight line 
mechanic with a different company. From August 2007 through January 2010, Applicant 
changed companies and was again a full-time flight line mechanic. In January and 
February 2010, he was unemployed and moved from the east coast to the southern 
Midwest. (Ex. 2) In February 2010, he obtained a job with his current employer. (Ex. 1) 
                                                          
2 No Ex. 3 was offered. 
 
3 It is noted that the three witnesses, who included the depot manager, made an hour and a half trip each 
way to attend the hearing and support Applicant’s request to obtain a security clearance.  
 
3 
 
 From 2008 through 2013, Applicant failed to pay federal income tax as required. 
(Tr. 2) In 2008, when he returned from his overseas contractor job, he was unable to 
pay his taxes. In 2008, he entered into an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) whereby he was paying $75 monthly on his delinquent tax bill. (Ex. 2) He asserted 
he also paid an additionally $2,000 annually on four occasions. (Ex. 2)  
 
In July 2013, Applicant and his wife separated, with his wife and children leaving 
the state to accept a job offer and move closer to her parents. (Ex. 2) He provides $700 
monthly child support and medical insurance for his family and is current on his support 
obligations. (Ex. 2, Ex. B-1) He and his wife remain separated. He incurred a loan (SOR 
1.k, $869) to help pay for the move. (Tr. 35) The loan remains unpaid and he has not 
had recent contact with the lender. (Tr. 35) 
 
In November 2013, when Applicant completed his Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Process (e-QIP), he indicated that starting in 2008, when he returned as 
a contractor from overseas, he had fallen behind on his federal income tax.4 At that 
time, he estimated he owed federal tax of approximately $16,000. (Ex. 1) He also 
indicated he had a $5,735 collection account (SOR 1.f, $8,380), a $1,548 (SOR 1.i) cell 
phone collection debt, a $304 (SOR 1.h) collection debt on a different cell phone 
account, and a $684 (SOR 1.j, $869) charged-off automobile debt. (Ex. 1)

2014 (Ex. E) $69,000 $63,000 $10,600 $12,000  $1,369 
 
In April 2012, Applicant started making $75 bi-weekly payments on the amount 
owed. (Ex. 2) The IRS documents show Applicant’s payment history. As of August 
2014, he was current on his monthly payments. As of August 2014, approximately 
$5,000 was yet owed for tax year 2008. While working overseas, his annual salary was 
$160,000 of which $85,000 was exempt from federal tax due to the foreign earned 
income exclusion. For tax year 2009 Applicant was entitled to a refund, which was 
applied to his 2007 tax debt. (Ex. 2)  
 
                                                          
4 Applicant lives in a state that does not collect state income tax.

A copy of Applicant’s 2012 federal tax return is not part of the record. However, a 
letter from the IRS indicates there was an $8,817 cancellation of debt occurred during 
2012, which increased his federal tax by $2,200. (Ex. D) Applicant did not indicate 
which debt had been cancelled. For tax year 2014, Applicant was due a refund of 
$1,369, which was applied to his tax debt. (Ex. E) 
The amount of tax owed as shown on Applicant’s tax returns was approximately  
$25,000 for tax years 2008 through 2013. This figure does not include additional 
amounts assessed by the IRS for penalties and interest. As of September 2014, 
Applicant’s federal tax liability was $39,421 for tax years 2008 through 2013. He had 
entered into a repayment arrangement with the IRS whereby he paid $150 every two 
weeks. (SOR Answer) In February 2015, he entered into a new repayment plan with the 
IRS whereby he would pay $275 every two weeks. As of February 2015, his federal tax 
liability for tax years 2008 through 2013 was $46,267. (Ex. C-2) 
 
In January 2014 and February 2014, Applicant was asked about his delinquent 
accounts during a Personal Subject Interview (PSI). (Ex. 2) At that time, he indicated 
that in 2013, when he and his wife separated and she left the state, he moved in with a 
friend and owed a $500 utility bill and $600 cable bill. He stated a credit card account 
(SOR 1.f, $8,380) became delinquent when he was maintaining two households after 
separating from his wife. (Ex. 2) At that time, he said he was going to contact the 
creditor to establish a repayment arrangement to satisfy this debt. In August 2014, the 
creditor offered to settle the matter for $4,189, which was half of the amount owed. (Ex. 
2) There is no documentation that the offer was accepted or that payment has been 
made in accord with the offer. 
 
During Applicant PSI, he was questioned about a $1,548 (SOR 1.i) wireless 
telephone account that had become delinquent in 2008, a second wireless telephone 
account (SOR 1.h, $304) in collection, a $684 (SOR 1.j) charged-off debt related to an 
automobile loan account, a $205 (SOR 1.e) medical collection account, a $79 (SOR 
1.m) telephone service collection account, and a $45 (SOR 1.n) medical collection 
account. He asserted he was going to attempt to set up a repayment plans on these 
debts. (Ex. 2) He has attempted to contact the medical provider of the $45 account, but 
has been unsuccessful. (Tr. 36) 
 
In August 2014, Applicant responded to written financial interrogatories. At that 
time, he disputed the amounts owed on SOR 1.i and SOR 1.f. Six months after 
discussing the debts in his PSI, he no longer recognized nor knew anything about the 
debts in SOR 1.e ($250), SOR 1.m ($79), and SOR 1.n ($45). (Ex. 2) He asserted he 
intended to obtain a loan from his 401(k) retirement plan and pay the valid SOR debts. 
(Ex. 2) As of August 2014, when he completed a Personal Financial Statement (PFS), 
his net monthly remainder (monthly income less monthly expenses and monthly debt 
payment) was $635. (Ex. 2)  
 
In April 2015, the $304 account (SOR 1.h) was settled and paid. (Ex. G) The 
creditor of the $684 (SOR 1.j) charged-off account offered to settle the debt for $450, 
 
5 
 
which Applicant accepted and paid. (Ex. F) The debt originated when his wife moved to 
a new location and missed three car payments. (Tr. 35) With the payment on the 
settlement offer, the car loan has been paid. (Tr. 49) He paid the $266 collection debt 
(SOR 1.g) and the $79 collection debt (SOR1.m). (Ex. C-5, C-6, Tr. 33, 36) 
 
Applicant contacted the creditor of the $250 medical debt listed in SOR 1.e. As of 
the hearing, the creditor had yet to respond. (Tr. 31) The creditor of the $8,380 account 
had offered in August 2014 to settle for half the balance. At the hearing, he indicated 
that now that he has paid off two other debts he is in a position to start making 
payments on this debt. (Tr. 32) He was going to contact the creditor to see if the offer is 
still valid and, if so, to set up a repayment plan. (Tr. 32) 
 
Applicant contacted the creditor of the $1,548 (SOR 1.i) account and is waiting 
for a response. (Tr. 34) He disputes the amount of the debt. He had cell phone service 
when his service was switched without notice to him from one company to another. His 
plan with his original provider offered free data. The second provider charged for data 
resulting in the debt. He had no information about the $1,325 debt (SOR 1.l) and would 
have to look into it. (Tr. 36) 
 
Applicant recently obtained a $2,500 loan from his 401(k) retirement plan to pay 
for repairs to his car. (Tr. 40) He has $6,000 in his retirement plan. (Tr. 41) He has not 
had any credit counseling. (Tr. 42) He is concentrating on paying his small debts. (Tr. 
48) He currently lives with a friend paying $150 monthly for rent and $210 for utilities. 
(Tr. 52) 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the interests of security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 
2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
 
6 
 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in 
terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty 
of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 Adjudicative Guideline (AG) ¶ 18 articulates the security concerns relating to 
financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
Additionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
safeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect 
of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  
 
A person’s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is 
uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent 
 
7 
 
substantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a 
history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is 
inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt 
free, but is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant has a history of financial problems. Applicant owes the IRS $46,000 for 
tax years 2008 through 2013. He also had ten collection accounts totaling 
approximately $14,000. Disqualifying Conditions AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness 
to satisfy debts,” AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations,” and AG ¶ 
19(g), “failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the 
fraudulent filing of the same,” apply.  
 
 Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant’s federal income tax problems started in 2008 when he returned from 
working overseas. Between 2007 and 2014, he was entitled to a tax refund on two 
occasions, for tax years 2009 and 2014. For all other years he was under withheld. In 
April 2010, he started repaying his delinquent obligation at a rate of $75 every two 
weeks. He asserts he had a repayment arrangement with the IRS in 2008, but failed to 
show any documentation for that agreement or payment in accord with the agreement. 
In September 2014, he raised his bi-weekly payments to $150 every two weeks. He 
owed approximately $39,400. In February 2015, he raised the payment rate to $275 
every two weeks. The amount owed had increased to $46,267 due in part to additional 
 
8 
 
interest and the notification in 2014, that a cancellation of debt in 2012 had increased 
his tax obligation by $2,200. Although his returns were not timely filed, all returns have 
now been filed as required. 
 
 Applicant had ten collection accounts. He has paid four of the accounts and a 
fifth creditor offered to settle an $8,380 debt for $4,189. He has not received a response 
or had contact with the other five collection accounts that total approximately $4,000. 
 
Because Applicant has multiple delinquent debts and his financial problems are 
continuing in nature, he receives minimal application of the mitigating conditions listed in 
AG ¶ 20(a). Under AG & 20(b), Applicant is separated from his wife and experienced 
the financial burden associated therewith. He incurred expenses to move his wife to a 
new location. He is current on his child support obligations. AG & 20(b) has limited 
applicability. 
 
Under AG & 20 (c) and &20 (d), Applicant has paid four of the ten collection 
accounts and has an offer reducing an additional debt to $4,100. The other five debts 
total another $4,000. He has an agreement repaying the IRS $275 every two weeks on 
his income tax obligation. The tax obligation is large, but he has consistently made 
payments to the IRS since at least 2010. I believe he will continue to honor his 
repayment agreement with the IRS until the entire obligation has been met. He has had 
no financial counseling, but his financial problems appear to be under control. AG & 
20(c) and & 20(d) apply. 
 
Applicant has challenged the amount owed on some of his accounts. The 
mitigating condition listed in AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply because Applicant has not 
provided documented proof to substantiate the basis of any disputed accounts.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
  The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
 
9 
 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. He 
honorably service in the U.S. Marine Corps. The debts incurred were not the type that 
indicates poor self-control. Money was not spent frivolously. The debts set forth in the 
SOR were not incurred on luxuries. His financial problems resulted from the under 
withholding of taxes from his salary.  
 
The issue is not simply whether all his debts are paid—it is whether his financial 
circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & 
2(a)(1).) Applicant has acted in good faith to address his delinquent financial 
obligations. Good faith requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows 
reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. Since 2010, 
Applicant has made regular payments to the IRS.  
 
Applicant has established a track record of making timely payments on his debt 
to the IRS. The concept of “meaningful track record” includes evidence of actual debt 
reduction through payment of debts. An applicant is not required to establish that he has 
paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is for him to 
demonstrate he has established a plan to resolve his delinquent debt and has taken 
significant action to implement that plan. I must reasonably consider the entirety of 
Applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that plan 
is credible and realistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all 
outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan may provide for payment 
on such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts 
actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant is paying his past-due tax obligation.  He is attempting to address his 
smaller delinquent accounts before attempting to pay the larger obligations. If the offer 
is accepted on the one debt the entirety of his delinquent accounts, excluding his tax 
obligation, is approximately $8,000. This is an amount within Applicant’s means to 
address. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.n:  For Applicant 
 
 
10 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
