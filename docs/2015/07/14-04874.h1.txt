GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 23, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On October 28, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, 
pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective

September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial 
Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF 
was unable to make an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The 
SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.2  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the initial version of the SOR as there is no 
receipt in the case file. In an undated statement, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations. On December 4, 2014, she elected to have her case decided on the written 
record in lieu of a hearing. On December 31, 2014, by e-mail, Applicant reaffirmed her 
earlier responses to the allegations in the initial SOR. A complete copy of the 
Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant on April 22, 
2015, and she was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of 
the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. 
In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the 
Guidelines applicable to her case. Applicant received the FORM on May 15, 2015. A 
response was due by June 14, 2015. On June 2, 2015, Applicant submitted information 
and documentation which addressed the allegations. The case was assigned to me on 
June 19, 2015.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations and personal conduct in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a. through 
1.q., and 2.a.). Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After 
a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been 
serving as a logistics management analyst with her current employer since October 
2011.3 She has also served in the U.S. Army Reserve since March 2009.4 Applicant 
was born in the Philippines, and she was raised and educated there until she 
immigrated to the United States in November 2008.5 A 1986 high school graduate, with 
a bachelor’s degree in an unspecified discipline in 1993, Applicant also earned graduate 
credits at a U.S. university towards her master’s degree, but has not earned such a 
degree.6  Applicant’s marital status is somewhat unclear. While Applicant reported in

 There was apparently some issue regarding a garbled initial version of the SOR that was issued wherein 
the lettered subparagraphs were either not sequential, missing, or duplicates.  Upon being notified of the issues, 
another corrected version of the SOR was issued to Applicant on December 20, 2014. The subsequent version of the 
SOR still contains an error with ¶ 2.a. referring to ¶ 1.p. instead of ¶ 1.q. See Item 1 (e-mail, dated December 20, 
2014). The initial version of the SOR, along with Applicant’s initial Responses to that version, are in the case file.

her e-QIP that she has never been married, 7 during her January 2014 interview with an 
investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), she claimed her 
status was that of a “housewife” at least during a portion of 2006.8 She has been 
residing with a cohabitant since March 2013.9 Applicant has two sons (born in 1992 and 
2004).10 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant was unemployed from the time she entered the United States as a 
resident alien awaiting her permanent resident “Green Card” in 2008 until March 2009. 
She was briefly unemployed again from July 2009 until August 2009 while awaiting 
induction into the U.S. military.11 During the period November 2008 until August 2010, 
she and her two sons resided with Applicant’s sister.12 When she and her sons moved 
to her own residence in August 2010, her unemployed mother also moved with them.13 
During her periods of unemployment, Applicant received unemployment compensation 
and supplemental benefits.14 It is unclear when Applicant first experienced financial 
difficulties, but she attributed them as follows:  
 
My 2 kids plus my unemployed mom were under my care. Juggling rent 
payments, insurances, every day expenses, school, etc., took its toll and 
living in [an expensive geographical area] did not make it any better. Even 
with my income at that time, it was not enough. I ended up making debt to 
pay for debt.15 
 
The SOR identified 16 purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, totaling 
approximately $39,324, which had been placed for collection or charged off. Those 
debts and their respective current status, according to an Equifax credit report,16 
Applicant’s comments to the OPM investigator, and her Answer to the SOR, are 
described as follows:

SOR ¶ 1.a. – There was an overpayment of unemployment and supplemental 
benefits in the approximate amount of $7,700 that occurred when Applicant failed to 
report increased income. She made no effort to resolve the debt. A state income tax 
refund was intercepted, and on March 10, 2015, $534 was applied to the outstanding 
balance.17 On March 11, 2015, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) applied $383.59 
from Applicant’s 2014 income tax refund to the outstanding balance.18 On an 
unspecified date, Applicant apparently entered into a repayment arrangement with the 
state, and she commenced making payments of $51.15, including a $1.15 convenience 
fee, on May 14, 2015. She has made two additional identical payments that same 
month.19 There is limited progress towards debt resolution. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b. – There is a delinquent federal income tax balance for the tax year 
2012 in the amount of approximately $2,000. She made no effort to resolve the debt. On 
March 23, 2015, the IRS applied $2,387.08 from Applicant’s 2014 income tax refund to 
pay off the tax owed for 2012.20 The account has been resolved. 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.e., 1.q., and 2.a. – There was a corporate credit card used for 
business expenses with an unpaid balance of approximately $4,123 that Applicant was 
unable to pay off after she was reimbursed for her travel. Applicant made two payments 
towards the debt, but both payments were returned for insufficient funds. She agreed to 
settle the debt and made another payment, but that payment was also returned for 
insufficient funds in August 2013. The account was charged off.21 She made no 
subsequent timely effort to resolve the debt. On April 6, 2015, Applicant agreed to a 
payroll deduction authorization agreement for the repayment of charges to the company 
credit card. She authorized that $500 be automatically deducted from her wages each 
pay period until the balance due was fully repaid. While there is no documentation to 
indicate that any payments have actually been made, it appears that there is limited 
progress towards debt resolution. 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d., 1.f., and 1.g. – There are two credit card accounts and a personal 
loan account with the same credit union with unpaid balances of $4,957, $2,964, and 
$2,820 that were charged off.22 She made no effort to resolve the debts. On May 2, 
2015, Applicant was offered several settlement offers by the creditor, and she agreed to 
repay the balances with monthly minimum payments.23 On June 12, 2015, she made

 IRS Notice, dated March 23, 2015, attached to Applicant’s Response to the FORM. Although it was not 
alleged in the SOR, Applicant apparently also had a delinquent federal income tax balance for the tax year 2013 in 
the amount of $2,387.08. The IRS applied that amount from the 2014 refund to pay off the tax owed for 2013.

her first agreed-upon payments of $29.31, $28.02, and $49.52.24 There is limited 
progress towards debt resolution. 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c., and 1.h. through 1.p. – There are a number of other accounts 
consisting of student loans ($8,527 and $310), credit cards ($1,918; $1,082; $380; 
$1,015; and $126), charge accounts ($513), and utility accounts ($761; and $128) in 
varying amounts that were placed for collection, charged off, transferred, or sold to 
other collection agents.25 Applicant offered no evidence to indicate that she made any 
efforts to contact her creditors or resolve those delinquent accounts. The accounts have 
not been resolved. 
 
Applicant claimed to be utilizing, or seeking assistance from, a credit counseling 
service or other similar resource to assist her in resolving her financial difficulties.26 That 
company purportedly furnished her the names of debt consolidation companies.27 She 
did not furnish any documentation to support her contention that she has received 
financial counseling or that she commenced any efforts regarding debt consolidation. 
 
During her OPM interview in January 2014, Applicant presented a verbal 
personal financial statement. Her net monthly income was $2,300; her monthly 
household expenses totaled $2,150; and her monthly debt expenses were $950, leaving 
her with a monthly deficit of minus $800.28  She explained that she was not living within 
her means because she was borrowing money from creditors to pay her previous 
debts.29 She hoped to reduce her spending, and intended to resolve her delinquent 
debts by the end of 2015. Nevertheless, as recently as her response to the FORM, 
Applicant offered little evidence to indicate that her financial problems are now under 
control. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”30 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his

designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”31   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”32 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.33  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”34

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”35 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant has had a long-standing problem with her finances which 
started as early as 2008 when she entered the United States as a resident alien. 
Although she obtained her present position in October 2011, she was not living within 
her means. She found herself juggling her financial resources to try to cover everyday 
life expenses, but ended up borrowing money from creditors to pay other creditors. 
Even with the overpayment of unemployment and supplemental benefits by the state; 
her failure to reimburse her employer for the use of her company credit card; and her 
initial failure to pay her federal income taxes, she had insufficient funds to continue 
making her routine monthly payments. Various accounts became delinquent, and were 
placed for collection and charged off.  AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
    
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
 
35
 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
 
 
8 
                                      
 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”36  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply. AG ¶ 20(b) minimally applies. The 
nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties since about 
2008 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” 
Applicant attributed her financial problems to a general juggling of her financial 
resources to try to cover everyday life expenses, which was not successful. Other than 
her comments about supporting her mother and two sons, she offered no specifics as to 
why she was spending more than what she was earning. There is no evidence that 
Applicant took any steps to contact most of her creditors in an effort to resolve her 
debts. Instead, it appears that her creditors initiated the first steps to resolve the 
accounts. The state and the IRS intercepted income tax refunds to apply to her 
overpayment of unemployment and supplemental benefits and unpaid income tax. After 
Applicant made three payments in 2013 regarding her corporate credit card, all of which 
were returned due to insufficient funds, in 2015 her employer obtained a payroll 
deduction authorization agreement from her. In June 2015 – nearly eight months after 
the SOR was issued – Applicant finally made her first agreed-upon payments of $29.31, 
$28.02, and $49.52 to her credit union for three delinquent accounts with a combined 
balance of $10,741. Applicant has offered no documentary evidence of a good-faith 
effort to resolve any of her other delinquent debts. She essentially ignored them, and 
seemingly continues to do so.  
 
Other than her own unsubstantiated written comments, there is no evidence to 
indicate that Applicant ever received financial counseling. Based on what she told the 
OPM investigator in January 2014, Applicant has monthly deficit of minus $800. The 
overwhelming evidence is that Applicant’s financial problems are not under control. 
Applicant has not acted responsibly by failing to address her delinquent accounts and 
                                                          
36
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

by making limited efforts of working with her creditors.37 Applicant’s actions under the 
circumstances confronting her cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and 
good judgment.38 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern under the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in AG ¶ 
15:  
      
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
The guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns. Under AG ¶ 
16(c), it is potentially disqualifying if there is   
 
credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not 
sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, 
but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person 
assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, 
lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other 
characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard 
protected information. 
 
Applicant left her corporate credit card with an unpaid balance of approximately 
$4,123 after she was reimbursed for her travel. Her three payments in 2013, each of 
which was returned for insufficient funds, resulted in the balance being charged off. She 
made no subsequent timely effort to resolve the debt until 2015 when she agreed to a 
payroll deduction authorization agreement. Because of her actions, AG ¶ 16(c) has 
been established.39  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from personal conduct, but none of them apply.

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

 The issue of adequate notice to Applicant has been raised because of the garbled versions of the SOR. 
The initial version had ¶ 2.a. refer to the information about the corporate credit card in ¶ 1.p., but with the “corrected” 
version, old ¶ 1.p. was changed to ¶ 1.q., but new ¶ 2.a. remained unchanged.  Applicant acknowledged that she had 
the same response for all items on the SOR regardless of the lettering on the paper copy. Accordingly, while there is 
some confusion created by the two versions of the SOR, I conclude that Applicant did, in fact, have adequate notice.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.40   
     
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. She has been 
with the same employer since October 2011 and with the U.S. Army Reserve since 
March 2009. She is apparently a loving and caring daughter and mother. She has 
declared her intentions of bringing her accounts current and repaying them.  
 
The disqualifying evidence is more substantial. Applicant obtained more 
unemployment and supplemental benefits than she was entitled to receive when she 
failed to report increased income; she failed to pay her federal income tax for the tax 
year 2012 until the IRS intercepted her refunds; she failed to reimburse her employer 
after she used the corporate credit card and was in turn reimbursed; she made three 
payments which were returned for insufficient funds; she ignored her delinquent credit 
union accounts, with a combined balance of $10,741, until June 2015 when she made 
three minimal payments for a combined total of $106.85; she has continued to ignore 
her remaining accounts; and she has a monthly budget deficit of minus $800. Applicant 
offered no evidence as to her reputation for reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment. Applicant’s long-standing failure, at least until June 2015, to voluntarily repay 
her creditors, even in the smallest amounts, or to arrange payment plans, reflects traits 
which raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. There are clear 
indications that Applicant’s financial problems are not under control. Applicant’s actions 
under the circumstances cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment. Considering the absence of confirmed debt resolution and elimination efforts, 
Applicant’s financial and personal conduct issues are likely to remain.

The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:41 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of ‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.’ However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has ‘. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.’ The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (‘Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.’) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated an essentially negative track record of voluntary 
debt reduction and elimination efforts, generally ignoring her delinquent debts until her 
creditors are able to take individual involuntary action, like the IRS attaching her income 
tax refunds to apply to income tax debts. Overall, the evidence leaves me with 
substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security 
clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the 
security concerns arising from her financial considerations and personal conduct 
concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).
