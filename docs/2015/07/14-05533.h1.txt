HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 13 delinquent, charged-off, or 
collection accounts totaling $41,693. He failed to provide sufficient documentation of his 
progress resolving his financial problems. Financial considerations concerns are not 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 7, 2014, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security clearance application (SF 86). 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On February 7, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated 
February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006.  
   
The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended

referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be 
granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) 
 
On February 28, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and he 
requested a hearing. (GE 3) On May 4, 2015, Department Counsel was ready to 
proceed. On May 7, 2015, the case was assigned to me. On June 10, 2015, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting 
Applicant’s hearing for June 25, 2015. (HE 1) Applicant said he received 15 days of 
notice of the date, time, and location of his hearing. (Transcript Tr. 15-16) Applicant’s 
hearing was held as scheduled. Department Counsel offered four exhibits into evidence, 
and Applicant provided seven exhibits. (Tr. 18-21; GE 1-4; AE A-G) All exhibits were 
admitted without objection. (Tr. 18, 21; GE 1-4; AG A-G) On July 6, 2015, DOHA 
received the transcript of Applicant’s hearing.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted SOR debts ¶¶ 1.a through 1.m.2 He 
also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are 
accepted as findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 40-year-old technician, who has worked for a defense contractor 
since January 2014.3 (Tr. 22-23, 29) In 1993, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 6) 
From 1994 to 1998, he served in the Air Force; he was a senior airman (E-4) when he 
left active duty; and he received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 7; AE G) In 1995, he 
married, and in 2010, he divorced. (Tr. 8) His child from his first marriage is 16, and his 
monthly child support is currently $920. (Tr. 8) In December 2015, his monthly child 
support payment will revert to $798 because his $756 arrearage will be paid. (Tr. 8, 33-
34) The child support payments are being garnished from Applicant’s pay. (Tr. 66) In 
2010, he married his current spouse. (Tr. 8) He has three children, who are ages 1, 3, 
and 4, and two step-children, who are 10 and 13, in his current household. (Tr. 8-9) His 
spouse does not work outside their home. (Tr. 9)      
 
Applicant first received a security clearance in the 1990s when he served in the 
Air Force. (Tr. 25) He held a security clearance when he worked for a defense 
contractor from January 2000 to July 2001 and from August 2001 to September 2013, 
when he worked for the Air Force as a civilian technician, (Tr. 26-28) He earned about 
$48,000 annually when he left his Air Force civilian technician employment in 2013. (Tr. 
27-28) In 2013, he moved to a different state to gain increased support from his family. 
(Tr. 28) Applicant was unemployed between October 2013 and November 2013. In

3Unless stated otherwise, Applicant’s April 7, 2014 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations 
Processing (e-QIP) version of security clearance application (SF 86) is the source for the facts in this 
paragraph and the next paragraph. (GE 1)

December 2013, he obtained employment in a call center, where he earned $10 an 
hour. (Tr. 28-29)  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
In 2010, Applicant withdrew $10,000 from his Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), and he 
was unaware that he had to pay taxes on the early withdrawal. (Tr. 35) The Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) issued a tax lien for $2,498. (Tr. 36) Applicant’s tax refunds for 
2011 and 2012 were intercepted and applied to his 2010 tax debt. (Tr. 36) He started 
making $43 monthly payments in October 2012 in compliance with the IRS payment 
plan, and the lien is now paid. (Tr. 36-37; AE C) Applicant filed his state taxes; however, 
he owes about $600 to a state for income taxes for tax year 2012 and $780 for tax year 
2013. (Tr. 38-39; GE 1) He is considering starting a payment plan to address his state 
income tax debts when his child support is reduced to $756 in December 2015. (Tr. 39-
40; AE A-B)   
 
Applicant’s financial problems were worse in 2012. (Tr. 30) The family’s 
bathroom flooded; car and washer repairs were necessary; sewage backed up into their 
home; and no child support was received for Applicant’s stepchildren. (Tr. 30) In 2013, 
Applicant lost 10 days of pay due to the furlough or about $2,000 in income. (Tr. 61-63) 
In August or September 2014, Applicant’s spouse began receiving $710 monthly in child 
support. (Tr. 57)  
 
Applicant’s annual income is $40,000. (Tr. 23) From March to July 2014, 
Applicant had a second job, earned $8.10 an hour, and worked 20 to 30 hours weekly. 
(Tr. 23) Applicant’s employment has been his family’s sole means of financial support. 
(Tr. 23, 30)  
 
In February 2014, Applicant began employment with his current employer, and 
that same month, his court-ordered child support was finalized resulting in an arrearage 
determination that he owed his former spouse $4,612. (Tr. 33; AE A-B) In 2014, 
Applicant’s federal income tax refund was intercepted and applied to his child-support 
arrearage. (Tr. 34)  
 
In 2011, Applicant borrowed about $103,000 to purchase his residence, and his 
mortgage was partially guaranteed by the Department of Veteran’s Affairs (VA). (Tr. 64) 
His home sustained considerable damage from electrical and sewage problems; the 
roof leaked; and a pipe broke. (Tr. 64-65) During the defense furlough, Applicant was 
three months behind on his mortgage. (GE 1) Applicant decided to move to a different 
state. Around October 2013, he left his home and “let it go” back to the mortgage 
company. (Tr. 42) On December 3, 2013, Applicant’s house was sold at auction; 
however, Applicant was unaware of the auction sale price and whether there was a 
deficiency. (Tr. 43; GE 1)4   
                                            
4The Department of Veteran’s Affairs home loan guarantee is $36,000, and veterans “usually 
have no liability to the government following a foreclosure, except in cases involving fraud, 
misrepresentation, or bad faith, such as allowing an unapproved assumption” of responsibility to repay

Applicant’s credit reports and SOR allege 13 delinquent, charged-off, or 
collection accounts totaling $41,693. (GE 2-4) Applicant’s budget shows a monthly 
remainder of $151. (Tr. 40; AE D)  
 
Applicant said he believed the two debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a (judgment for $10,199) 
and 1.b (charged-off debt for $8,999) are the same debt, as both debts originated from 
the same creditor; they are approximately the same magnitude; and Applicant only had 
one credit-card account with this creditor. (Tr. 45-46) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c for $6,759 
resulted from a credit-card account used to pay living expenses. (Tr. 46) The debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.d (charged-off debt for $5,805) resulted from a repossessed vehicle, which 
was sold at auction.     
 
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e for $3,598, 1.f for $2,283, and 1.g for $1,393 resulted 
from use of two bank credit cards and one bank loan. (Tr. 48-50; GE 4) The debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.h for $639, 1.i for $596, and 1.j for $352 resulted from two 
telecommunications accounts and one utility account. (Tr. 51-53; GE 4) The debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.k for $188, 1.l for $120, and 1.m for $42 resulted from copays that medical 
insurance did not cover.  (Tr. 53-56; GE 2, 4) 
 
In May 2014, Applicant withdrew the remaining funds in his TSP account, which 
totaled about $14,000 or $15,000. (Tr. 56, 68) He used the funds for living expenses. 
(Tr. 58-59) 
 
In 2014, Applicant considered filing for bankruptcy; however, he did not have the 
funds to pay a bankruptcy attorney at that time. (Tr. 41; GE 1) Starting in December 
2015, he intends to use the extra $122 available after his child support arrearage is paid 
to start paying his delinquent SOR debts. He is also considering bankruptcy to resolve 
his debts. (Tr. 42, 61) 
 
Applicant did not contact any of the SOR creditors after receiving the SOR. (Tr. 
47) He has not received financial counseling. (Tr. 47) He has not made any payments to 
any of the SOR creditors.       
 
Character Evidence 
 
Applicant received the following awards, citations, and ribbons: Air Force 
Achievement Medal with one device; Air Force Training Ribbon; National Defense 
Service Medal; Air Force Outstanding Unit Ribbon; Air Force Good Conduct Medal; and 
Air Force Longevity Service Award. (AE G)  
 
Applicant provided three letters from co-workers and friends. (AE E) They 
describe him as a committed and diligent worker, responsible, trustworthy, family-
                                                                                                                                            
the loan. In this situation, Applicant’s debt to the creditor could theoretically be $77,000 ($103,000 minus 
$36,000 which would be paid by the VA). Applicant would be entitled to a credit for the amount received 
based on the sale of the property. He may also owe state property taxes on this house and legal fees 
relating to the property’s sale and unpaid interest.

oriented, conscientious, loyal, and honorable. (AE E) His 2014 employer’s evaluation 
indicated he met or exceeded expectations in all categories. (AE F)  
   
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).

Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports and SOR response. Applicant’s SOR alleges 13 delinquent, charged-off, 
or collection accounts totaling $41,693. The Government established the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible 
applicability of mitigating conditions.5 
                                            
5Applicant’s SOR does not allege that he defaulted on his mortgage and failed to pay his state 
income taxes in full for two years. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal 
Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.

Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;6 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
                                                                                                                                            
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). Applicant’s default on his mortgage and state tax debts will not be considered for any 
purpose, except in the whole-person discussion.   
 
6The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
 Applicant’s conduct in resolving his delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all of his SOR debts. He did not provide 
sufficient information about his finances to establish his inability to make greater 
progress paying his SOR creditors. Underemployment, unemployment, maintenance 
problems with his vehicle and home, the defense furlough, substantial child support 
responsibilities, his spouse’s inability to receive child support, and federal income tax 
debt resulting from TSP early withdrawals are circumstances partially or largely beyond 
his control; however, he did not provide proof that he act responsibly under the 
circumstances.   
 
 Applicant is credited with resolving the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b. The two debts in SOR 
¶¶ 1.a (judgment for $10,199) and 1.b (charged-off debt for $8,999) are the same debt. 
He also paid his delinquent federal income taxes from 2010 and will bring his child 
support debt to current status in December 2015.    
 
 Applicant presented insufficient evidence about what he has done since 
becoming employed with his current employer to pay or resolve his SOR debts or his 
other debts. Except for the positive information in the previous paragraph, he did not 
provide any of the following documentation relating to the SOR creditors: (1) proof of 
payments, such as checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or a letter 
from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the creditor; (2) 
correspondence to or from any creditors to establish maintenance of contact with 
creditors;7 (3) a credible debt dispute indicating he did not believe he was responsible 
for the debt and why he held such a belief; (4) attempts to negotiate payment plans, 
such as settlement offers or agreements to show that he was attempting to resolve 
these SOR debts; (5) evidence of financial counseling; or (6) other evidence of progress 
or resolution of his SOR debts. 
 
                                            
7“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

 Applicant’s failure to prove that he has made more substantial steps to resolve 
his debts shows a lack of judgment and responsibility that weighs against approval of 
his security clearance. There is insufficient evidence that he was unable to make 
greater progress resolving his delinquent debts, or that his financial problems are being 
resolved, are under control, and will not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, 
he failed to establish that financial consideration concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance. Applicant 
is a 40-year-old technician, who has worked for a defense contractor since January 
2014. From 1994 to 1998, he served in the Air Force; he was a senior airman when he 
left active duty; and he received an honorable discharge. Applicant received the 
following awards, citations, and ribbons: Air Force Achievement Medal with one device; 
Air Force Training Ribbon; National Defense Service Medal; Air Force Outstanding Unit 
Ribbon; Air Force Good Conduct Medal; and Air Force Longevity Service Award. Three 
co-workers and friends lauded his diligence, responsibility, trustworthiness, family-
orientation, loyalty, honor, and conscientious attention to his work. His 2014 employer’s 
evaluation indicated he met or exceeded expectations in all categories.  
 
Applicant’s child from the first marriage is 16, and his monthly child support is 
currently $920. In December 2015, his child support will revert to $798 because his 
$756 arrearage will be paid. He paid his delinquent federal income tax debt from 2010. 
In 2010, he married his current spouse, and he has five minor children in his household. 
His spouse does not work outside their home.

Underemployment, unemployment, maintenance problems with his vehicle and 
home, the defense furlough, substantial child support responsibilities, his spouse’s 
inability to receive child support, and federal income tax debt resulting from TSP early 
withdrawals are circumstances partially or largely beyond his control, which contributed 
to his financial problems. Applicant has a security clearance for about 20 years, and 
there is no evidence of security violations, abuse of alcohol, or use of illegal drugs. 
Applicant disclosed his delinquent debts and state and federal income tax problems on 
his April 7, 2014 SF 86.  
The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more 
substantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial problems. His SOR alleges 
13 delinquent, charged-off, or collection accounts totaling $41,693. The debt in SOR ¶ 
1.b (charged-off debt for $8,999) is mitigated, reducing the SOR debt total to 12 debts 
for $32,694. His two state tax debts have been delinquent for more than one year with 
no payments made to the state income tax authority. He failed to provide sufficient 
documentation of progress to resolve his financial problems. His failure to provide more 
corroborating documentation shows lack of financial responsibility and judgment and 
raises unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18. More information about inability to pay 
debts or documented financial progress is necessary to mitigate security concerns. 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to 
Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a 
determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary to 
justify the award of a security clearance in the future. With more effort towards 
documented resolution of his past-due debts, and a track record of behavior consistent 
with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his 
security clearance worthiness. Based on the facts before me and the adjudicative 
guidelines that I am required to apply, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility at this time. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial considerations concerns are 
not mitigated.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.c through 1.m: Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to reinstate Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
