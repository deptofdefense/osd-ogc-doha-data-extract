LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke a security
clearance to work in the defense industry. He provided sufficient evidence to explain
and mitigate the financial considerations security concern. In addition, he was involved
in two incidents of family violence in 2008 and 2012, both of which resulted in
misdemeanor criminal convictions in 2008 and 2013, respectively. He is serving a
sentence to probation until July 2015. Applicant’s two criminal convictions for family
violence offenses in a period of about five years is simply too much to overlook or
explain away. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (Standard Form 86) on September 18, 2013.  After reviewing the application1
and information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,2
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.    
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate3
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia.

(DOD), on October 9, 2014, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it
was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him
eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint.  It2 3
detailed the reasons for the action under the security guidelines known as Guideline F
for financial considerations and Guideline J for criminal conduct. He answered the SOR
on November 7, 2014, and requested a hearing.  
The case was assigned to me on February 25, 2015. The hearing was held as
scheduled on March 24, 2015. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1–7, and they were
admitted. Applicant offered Exhibits A and B, and they were admitted. The hearing
transcript (Tr.) was received on March 31, 2015.
The record was kept open until April 7, 2015, to provide Applicant an opportunity
to submit additional documentation. Those matters were timely submitted and they are
admitted, without objections, as Exhibits C and D.  
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 37-year-old supervisor/aircraft electrician for a federal contractor.
He is seeking to retain a security clearance previously granted to him in 2011. He has
worked for his current employer since 2008. His first marriage ended in divorce, and he
married for the second time in 2007. He and his wife have two children under the age of
nine. He has a 15-year-old child from his first marriage. In addition, he has a 12-year-old
child from another relationship. He pays child support for both of those children.
This case is Applicant’s second appearance before me. I heard his first case in
2011, when I granted him a security clearance. That matter was raised as a potential
issue at the start of the 2015 hearing, and neither Department Counsel nor Applicant
requested that I recuse or disqualify myself based on participation in Applicant’s 2011
case.  The findings of fact from my 2011 decision are incorporated herein by reference.4 5
In that decision, I found that Applicant had paid or settled 12 of 21 delinquent debts, had
otherwise resolved 2 debts, had 2 debts in the process of repayment, had 4 unresolved

3
debts, and 1 debt was a duplicate. Based on those circumstances, I concluded that he
had presented sufficient evidence to establish a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve the debts. In addition, I concluded that he did not provide
deliberately false answers in response to two questions about his financial record on his
then security clearance application.
Applicant’s employment history includes military service in the U.S. Marine Corps
during 1995–2002. While on active duty, he was trained and worked as an engineer
equipment operator. He was honorably discharged as a sergeant (pay grade E-5).
Since leaving military service, Applicant obtained further education and
successfully completed a transition to the aviation industry. He attended a college of
aeronautics and technology during 2006–2008, was awarded a degree or certificate as
an aviation electrician in March 2008, and shortly thereafter began working for his
current employer as an aircraft electrician. He continued his education during
2008–2012, and was awarded a bachelor’s degree in May 2012. And he will soon
complete a master’s degree in the field of management, which was a company-paid
benefit in exchange for a two-year commitment. He anticipates a possible promotion to
a managerial position in 2016, which would result in a substantial increase in pay.  6
The SOR alleged two delinquent accounts, both of which stemmed from
deficiency balances after repossessions. The first delinquent account is a $4,470
charged-off account, which was one of the unresolved debts in my 2011 decision.7
Applicant initiated contact with the creditor in 2014 and established a repayment
agreement. As of March 2015, he had made six monthly payments of $50 monthly,
thereby reducing the balance to $4,171.  The second delinquent account is a $6,9748
collection account. Applicant had on-again, off-again contact with the creditor, he was
unable to establish any regular payments, and he understands the creditor eventually
cancelled or forgave the debt in 2014.  He submitted a page from an October 20149
credit report, which describes the account as a paid collection with a $0 balance.  I find10
that the account was not paid or settled, but it is otherwise resolved. 
Overall, Applicant’s financial situation is relatively stable as shown by a current
personal financial statement.  It shows a total net monthly income of $5,700, total11
monthly expenses of $2,700, total monthly debt payments of $885, and a positive net

remainder of $2,115. He estimated his 2015 annual salary at $70,000 to $80,000 plus
overtime resulting in a gross income of about $100,000.  Applicant’s wife is not12
employed outside the home, but she receives $800 monthly in disability compensation
from the Social Security Administration due to an assault by a former boyfriend.  In13
addition, Applicant recently qualified for a mortgage loan and bought a home in which
he and his family are now living.  14
The SOR also alleged two incidents of family violence between Applicant and his
wife, the first in 2008 and the second in 2012. Both incidents ended in misdemeanor
criminal convictions.  Both incidents stemmed from arguments that escalated to the15
point of violence.  
The April 2008 incident took place during the first year of marriage when
Applicant and his wife were arguing about having another child.  Their argument16
escalated to the point where Applicant head butted his wife resulting in a bruise to her
forehead. Applicant pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor offense resulting in a $750 fine,
court costs of $305, and probation for one year. He was also required to attend anger-
management and conflict-resolution counseling. 
The November 2012 incident took place after a series of events that occurred
over time that escalated into a major dispute between Applicant and his wife.  The17
events included money issues, discovery that his wife had a boyfriend, and
accountability and honesty issues. On the day of the incident, they had a lengthy
argument over his wife hiding his truck keys thereby preventing him from leaving.
Applicant described the fight as follows:
She came at me, not really like to attack me, but she kind of ran towards
me, while I pushed her back away from me. She then kicked me, and then
she punched me, and then she also - - she has fake fingernails, so she
grabbed a hold of me and scratched me, so I had scratch marks down my
right - - down my left check and right here on my throat, from where she
had grabbed a hold of me.
So now we are rolling around of the floor, still yelling at each other. Our
two children ran outside to the neighbor’s house to get them, and she

finally said, I will tell you where your truck keys are if you let me go. So I
did. Well, she jumped up and ran out the door, too, went to the neighbor’s
house, who is now calling 911.   18
Applicant followed his wife outside, threw two cell phones to the ground and
broke them, and went back inside the home and waited for the police to arrive and
arrest him, which they did. He was charged with a felony-level family assault offense
because it was a second offense involving a family member, and he was charged with
interfering with an emergency call by throwing and breaking the cell phones. 
Applicant self-reported the incident to his security manager within two days of his
arrest.  He and his wife immediately separated and lived apart for several months until19
July 2013, when they reconciled. That same month he then pleaded guilty to the
misdemeanor interference offense and was placed on deferred adjudication community
supervision for 12 months. One year later, the state court discharged Applicant from
deferred adjudication community supervision and the proceedings were dismissed.20
Concerning the felony-level family assault offense, Applicant pleaded guilty to a
lesser included misdemeanor family assault offense after his wife came forward and
explained her role in the incident. The state court sentenced Applicant to pay a $500
fine, court costs of $209, and $150 in fees, and to serve probation for two years, which
is scheduled to end in July 2015. Applicant explained that he has complied with all the
terms of probation and was waiting for the term to expire.   
Applicant has complied with all court-ordered counseling, but he and his wife
have not participated in any marriage or other type of counseling because she refuses
to attend.  He also explained that he and his wife are doing several things to avoid a21
recurrence and using techniques to de-escalate disagreements.22
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As23
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the

side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt24
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An25
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  26
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting27
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An28
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate29
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  30
In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a
preponderance of the evidence.  The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s31
reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence
standard.32
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. The
Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those
persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a

person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it33
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant34
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 35
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  36
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly compromise
classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It encompasses
concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important qualities. A
person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or
negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. Taken together, the evidence indicates inability or unwillingness
to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning37 38
of Guideline F. 
 In mitigation, I have considered six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and39
I have especially considered the following as most pertinent: 
 AG ¶ 30. 40
 AG ¶¶ 32(a)–(e).41
8
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
To start, Applicant’s history of financial problems or difficulties goes back several
years, as established in my 2011 decision, and he has been making slow but steady
progress in resolving them. The two delinquent debts in the 2014 SOR were incurred
years ago. The charged-off account is now being resolved by a monthly repayment
agreement, and he has made six monthly payments thereby reducing the balance
owed. The collection account was otherwise resolved when the creditor cancelled or
forgave it, and a 2014 credit report shows it was paid. Taken together, combined with
Applicant’s overall financial situation, he provided sufficient evidence to explain and
mitigate the financial considerations security concern.   
Concerning the criminal conduct under Guideline J, there is substantial evidence
of Applicant’s involvement in criminal activity that creates doubt about his judgment,
reliability, trustworthiness, and ability or willingness to be a law-abiding person.  The40
available evidence requires application of the following disqualifying conditions:
AG ¶ 31(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;
AG ¶ 31(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of
whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or
convicted; and
AG ¶ 31(d) [the person] is currently on parole or probation.
Applicant stands twice convicted in a period of about five years of family violence
offenses against his wife. The second incident was serious, as shown by Applicant’s
own description, quoted above, and the felony-level charge that was initially brought
against him. When the record closed in this case (April 2015), he was currently on
probation, although it should have recently concluded. In addition, I have real concerns
and doubts whether Applicant’s history of marital strife is safely in the past and will not
recur. On that point, it is telling that Applicant has not engaged in any counseling other
than what was required by the court. The fact that his wife refuses to participate with
Applicant in counseling is telling as well. Taken together, those circumstances militate
against a favorable decision.
In reaching this conclusion, I have considered all the mitigating conditions under
Guideline J,  and none, individually or in combination, is sufficient to mitigate the41
security concern raised by Applicant’s history of criminal activity. At bottom, Applicant’s
two criminal convictions for family violence offenses in a period of about five years is
simply too much to overlook or explain away. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).42

evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the
unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person
concept.  I am convinced that Applicant accepts responsibility for his actions,  but I am42 43
not convinced that the risk of recurrence is acceptably low. Accordingly, I conclude that
he did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.b: For Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline J: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 2.a–2.b: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility is
denied.
