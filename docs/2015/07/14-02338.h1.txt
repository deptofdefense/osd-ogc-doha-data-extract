MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
After she was discharged from legal repayment liability for debts covered by a 2006 
bankruptcy, Applicant incurred delinquent debt in excess of $31,628. She had periods of 
unemployment that likely contributed to her financial problems. As of December 2014, 
Applicant had resolved two of the debts in the SOR. It is too soon to conclude that her 
financial difficulties are behind her, given she still owes more than $30,000 in delinquent 
debt. Position of trust is denied. 
 
 Statement of the Case  
 
On July 23, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the 
trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, as to why it could 
not grant her eligibility for a public trust position. The DOD CAF took action under 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense 
Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (January 1987) as amended; and the 
 
 
 2 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 
2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR allegations on September 2, 2014. She indicated at 
that time that she wanted a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
administrative judge to issue a decision in her case. In response to a DOD request for 
clarification about whether she wanted the judge to issue a decision after a hearing or on 
the written record, Applicant indicated on September 22, 2014, that she did not want a 
hearing. 
 
On December 9, 2014, the Government submitted a File of Relevant Material 
(FORM) consisting of eight documents (Items 1-8). On December 15, 2014, DOHA 
forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed her to respond within 30 days of 
receipt. Applicant received the FORM on January 8, 2015. She did not submit a response 
by the February 7, 2015 due date. On March 10, 2015, the case was assigned to me to 
consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a public trust 
position for Applicant. 
 
Summary of SOR Allegations 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that as of July 23, 2014, Applicant owed 
delinquent debt totaling $31,628 on 11 accounts (SOR 1.a-1.k) following a February 2006 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge (SOR 1.l). (Item 1.) When Applicant answered the SOR, 
she admitted the bankruptcy discharge and the past-due debts in SOR 1.a-1.f and 1.h-1.i. 
Applicant denied the debts in SOR 1.g, 1.j, and 1.k because she had paid them. Applicant 
added that she had paid seven debts in all, including a student loan. She expressed intent 
to pay the rest of her debts in the following priority:  1.d, 1.e, 1.j, 1.h, 1.f, 1.c, 1.b, and then 
1.a. (Item 3.) 
 
Findings of Fact 
  
  After considering the FORM, which includes some payment records from Applicant 
(Item 5), I make the following findings of fact:  
  
Applicant is a 51-year-old high school graduate with two associate degrees awarded 
in May 1993. In January 2004, she earned a certificate from a technical institute in 
information technology. Since March 2013, Applicant has been employed as an intake 
agent for a healthcare company under a DOD contract. She also works as a tutor part time. 
(Item 6.) 
 
Applicant was married from November 1984 to January 1999. She has two adult 
children: a son age 32 and a daughter age 30. As of January 2015, Applicant was living 
with her son in military housing. (Item 6; FORM receipt.) 
 
Applicant lived in her hometown until April 2005 when she moved to her present 
area. She was unemployed until July 2005, when she began working as a certified nurse 
 
 3 
assistant in the home setting for a private homecare company. She had previous 
experience as a home health aide for the two years immediately preceding her relocation. 
(Item 6.) On October 15, 2005, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. The record 
before me for review contains no information about the nature or extent of her debts 
covered by the bankruptcy. Available credit records show that she was granted a discharge 
of her legal liability to repay the covered debts on February 16, 2006. (Items 7, 8.) 
 
In April 2008, Applicant’s job ended. After a couple of months being unemployed, 
she worked for the state as a program service evaluator from June 2008 to January 2009, 
when she was laid off. From February 2009 to October 2010, Applicant worked part time 
from her locale as a customer service representative for a staffing agency located in her 
home state. The company ceased business operations, and Applicant was without work 
from October 2010 to March 2011. From March 2011 to September 2011 she held 
seasonal, part-time employment as a sales and reservation representative for a moving 
truck rental company. Apart from self-employed income as a tutor, she had no work from 
September 2011 to March 2013, when she began her current job. (Item 6.) The evidentiary 
record before me for review is silent about Applicant’s income for any of her jobs. Likewise, 
it is unclear whether she collected unemployment at any time. 
 
On March 7, 2013, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of the 
information provided on an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). 
Applicant responded affirmatively on her e-QIP to the financial record inquiries concerning 
any possessions or property repossessed in the past seven years; any loan defaults in the 
past seven years; any bills or debts turned over for collection in the past seven years; and 
any debts currently over 120 days delinquent. She disclosed two auto loan debts of $9,300 
and $6,000. She explained that the $6,000 debt was for a car for her daughter. The vehicle 
had been stolen, and her daughter could not afford the payments after she lost her job. 
Applicant added that once she had steady employment, she would make arrangement to 
pay the loan balances. (Item 6.) 
 
A check of Applicant’s credit on March 15, 2013, revealed several additional 
delinquencies on her credit record. (Item 7.) There is no evidence that Applicant was ever 
interviewed about her past-due debts, but she provided DOHA with evidence of some 
payments before the FORM was prepared. (Item 5.) Her delinquent accounts and any 
payments to resolve them are set forth in the following table.

 On July 23, 2014, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant, alleging $31,628 in 
delinquent debt. Information in the FORM shows that in 2013, Applicant had paid off the 
debts in SOR 1.g and 1.k, and four other accounts not alleged in the SOR.
1
 (Item 5.) 
Applicant indicated in response to the SOR in September 2014 that she had paid seven 
debts on her credit record, including a student loan (not alleged) and the debts in SOR 1.g, 
1.j, and 1.k. However, about the $288 debt in SOR 1.j, she discrepantly expressed intent to 
pay the debt after she resolved the debts in SOR 1.d and 1.e, which she reportedly had 
“faxed to negotiate amount and make payment arrangements.” She planned to pay off her 
smaller debts first. (Item 3.) 
 
 Applicant was advised in the FORM of the Government’s concerns about her 
holding a public trust position or being granted access to sensitive information because of 
her unresolved delinquent debts. She was provided an opportunity to supplement the 
record with evidence of additional debt payments, and she filed no response. 
 
Policies 
 
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.” 
(See Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) The standard that must be met for 
assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s 
loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the person to sensitive duties 
is clearly consistent with national security. (See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.) The Deputy Under 
Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated November 
19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by 
the Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel Management. Department of 
Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the 
Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.  
  
When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the 
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on 
the evidence contained in the record.

In addition to the delinquent wireless phone and retail debts included in the table, Applicant indicated that she 
paid off a retail account and a student loan account. The retailer had initiated a credit inquiry in September 
2011, but the account does not appear on Applicant’s credit record. Information about the balance and its 
status (i.e., whether current or delinquent) is not in evidence. Applicant’s credit report shows that a $5,500 
student loan, opened in August 1999, was reported as a zero balance but also with a history of delinquency of 
90 days. The account was rated as current with the following notation:  “customer says account paid/being 
paid by insurance.” (Item 7.) 
 
 6 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The Applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision.  
  
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. See Executive Order 12968, 
Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The trustworthiness concerns about financial considerations are set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 The evidence establishes the financial considerations concerns. Applicant had paid 
two of the alleged debts before the SOR was issued. Even so, as of July 2014, she owed 
approximately $30,617 in past-due debt incurred after she had been afforded a financial 
fresh start in bankruptcy. Disqualifying conditions AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations,” apply 
because of Applicant’s record of financial delinquency. 
 
 Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(e), “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the 
legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue,” is satisfied as to the alleged debts in SOR 1.g and 1.k because they 
were paid before the SOR was issued. AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply to the delinquencies that 
are still unpaid (SOR 1.a-1.f and 1.h-1.j).  
 
 Several of Applicant’s debts have been delinquent for some time with no effort to 
address them. Applicant defaulted on her student loan in SOR 1.a in 2007. She stopped 
 
 7 
paying on her auto loan (SOR 1.b) in November 2008. The apartment debt in SOR 1.f has 
been in collection since September 2008. The retail charge card debt in SOR 1.d and the 
cash loan debt in SOR 1.h have been owed since 2008. AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior 
happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment,” cannot reasonably apply. 
 
 In the three years preceding her bankruptcy filing, Applicant either worked in home 
health care or was unemployed. After her job in private duty homecare ended in April 2008, 
Applicant had full-time employment only from June 2008 to January 2009, when she 
worked for the state. She held part-time jobs or was unemployed until March 2013, when 
she began her current employment with a DOD contractor. AG ¶ 20(b) is implicated when 
debts are incurred largely because of unemployment or low income due to factors beyond 
the person’s control: 
 
 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
 
 However, Applicant has not presented sufficient information about her finances, 
including information about her income and debt expenses, to enable me to conclude that 
she has acted reasonably with regard to managing her personal finances. Available 
information suggests that she may have taken on more debt than she could afford. She 
took on two auto loans in October 2006 with car payments of $314 and $307 per month. 
She was granted credit despite her relatively recent bankruptcy discharge in February 
2006, probably because she had a full-time job as certified nursing assistant since July 
2005. The second car loan (SOR 1.c) was for her daughter’s vehicle, and her daughter 
apparently paid on the loan through April 2010. However, Applicant was legally liable on 
the loan, so she assumed the financial risk. Little is known about the $2,544 apartment 
debt (SOR 1.f) apart from it being in collection as of September 2008. According to the e-
QIP, Applicant had been unemployed between April 2008 and June 2008, and she moved 
in June 2008 to a new address. Assuming that the debt in SOR 1.f covers missed rent from 
when she was unemployed, she worked full time from June 2008 to January 2009 as a 
state employee, and there is no evidence that she tried to arrange for repayment of the 
debt. Likewise, Applicant’s student loan in SOR 1.a has been in collection for years without 
any effort on her part to address it. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” 
and AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts,” have some applicability in that Applicant paid the debts in SOR 
1.g and 1.k in July 2013 and April 2013, respectively. She also resolved some debts not 
alleged in the SOR. Applicant’s satisfaction of these debts before the issuance of the SOR 
is certainly evidence of good faith on her part. However, even considering the debts not 
alleged in the SOR, she still owes more than $30,000 in delinquent debt. Furthermore, she 
 
 8 
has not adequately explained the absence of any payments in 2014 toward her past-due 
debts. It is too soon to conclude that her financial problems are behind her and not likely to 
recur. The financial considerations concerns are not sufficiently mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).
2
 
 
Applicant chose the legal remedy of bankruptcy to alleviate an unknown debt 
burden. It is unclear whether financial mismanagement or other factors, such as low 
income and the cost of raising her two children after her divorce, led to the bankruptcy 
filing. Considerable doubts are raised about Applicant’s financial judgment after the 
bankruptcy in the absence of evidence that could reasonably excuse or mitigate her failure 
to maintain her debt payments. In making the whole-person assessment required under the 
Directive, the DOHA Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required, as a matter of 
law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only 
establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the 
plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Nor is she required to 
pay the debts in the SOR before other debts. Applicant indicated in response to the SOR 
that she had paid seven debts, although there is no proof of her claimed satisfaction of the 
debt in SOR 1.j. She admitted no progress toward resolving her sizeable student loan and 
car loan debts. Applicant indicated in response to the SOR that she would be satisfying her 
remaining debts, starting with the lowest. She had an opportunity in response to the FORM 
to show that she has established repayment arrangements in accord with her stated intent. 
She elected to file no response. There are inadequate assurances that she can be counted 
on to follow through on her stated intent to resolve her debts, given the absence of any 
documented progress in 2014 toward resolving her more than $30,000 in remaining 
delinquent debt. After considering all the facts and circumstances, I conclude that it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant access to sensitive information at 
this time. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
                                                 
2 
The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust 
position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.
