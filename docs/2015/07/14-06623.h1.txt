HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 17 delinquent, charged-off, or 
collection accounts totaling $34,955. She failed to provide sufficient documentation of 
her progress resolving her financial problems. Financial considerations concerns are not 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 12, 2014, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security clearance application (SF 86). 
(Item 3) On March 14, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006.    
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked. (Item 1) 
 
On April 9, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and waived her 
right to a hearing. (Item 2) A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), 
dated June 15, 2015, was provided to her on June 29, 2015.1 On July 14, 2015, 
Applicant responded to the FORM. Department Counsel did not object to Applicant’s 
submission. The case was assigned to me on July 23, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted SOR debts ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e, 1.g 
through 1.o, and she denied the remaining SOR debts.3 She also provided extenuating 
and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 31-year-old bilingual call center operator, who has worked for a 
defense contractor since April 2014.4 From November 2013 to April 2014,5 and from 
November 2012 to July 2013, she was unemployed. From July 2013 to October 2013, 
she worked for a temporary staffing agency. From May 2011 to November 2012, she 
was a scheduler at a medical office. From March 2010 to May 2011, she was a collector 
for the Department of Education. From July 2009 to March 2010, she worked in bilingual 
customer service. From January 2008 to July 2009, she worked as a financial 
counselor. From May 2005 to January 2008, she worked in customer service. From 
September 2003 to May 2005, she was a stay-at-home mother. She received some 
unemployment compensation and support from her mother, when she was unemployed. 
She has never served in the military.   
 
From 2007 to 2009, and from 2012 to 2013, she attended college. She did not 
receive a degree. In May 2010, she was married, and in May 2011, she was separated 
from her spouse. Her children were born in 2003, 2008, and 2013.  
                                            
1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated June 17, 2015, 
and Applicant’s receipt is dated June 29, 2015. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that she 
had 30 days after her receipt to submit information.  
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.  
 
3The source for the information in this paragraph is Applicant’s SOR response. (Item 2)   
 
4Unless stated otherwise, Applicant’s April 12, 2014 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations 
Processing (e-QIP) version of security clearance application (SF 86) is the source for the facts in this 
paragraph and the next paragraph. (Item 3) 
 
5In Applicant’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), she 
disclosed unemployment from November 2013 to April 2014, September 2010 to May 2011, May 2007 to 
July 2007, November 2012 to July 2013, and September 2003 to May 2005. (Item 4) I have credited her 
with the unemployment described in her April 12, 2014 SF 86 and OPM PSI. (Items 3, 4)   
 
3 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
On her April 12, 2014 SF 86, Applicant disclosed the voluntary repossession of 
two vehicles resulting in estimated delinquent debts of $7,500 in 2008 and $18,000 in 
2010. She did not disclose her other delinquent debts. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s credit reports and SOR allege 17 delinquent, charged-off, or 
collection accounts totaling $34,955. (Items 1, 5, 6; AE A) Applicant did not explain why 
she had delinquent debts in her SOR response; however, she did provide a detailed 
explanation to an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator on June 24, 
2014. She explained that being a single parent of three minor children, the purchase of 
two defective vehicles that were subsequently repossessed, and multiple periods of 
unemployment were the causes of her financial plight. She admitted responsibility for 
most of the debts on her credit report, intended to investigate her debts, and planned to 
seek discharge of her unsecured nonpriority debts under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy 
Code. (Item 4)   
 
Applicant’s SOR response indicated she used a credit-repair company and was 
successful in disputing the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.h. in one credit report. She 
successfully disputed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g for $6,820 from two credit reports.  
 
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c for $3,992 and 1.h for $2,589 are duplications of each 
other. She denied responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f for $164, 1.p for $384, and 
1.q for $152, and they have been removed from all of her credit reports. There is no 
evidence of security violations, abuse of alcohol, or use of illegal drugs.   
  
Applicant’s FORM repeated the admonition about the absence of corroborating 
documentation and other mitigating information and explained that Applicant had 30 
days from the receipt of the FORM “in which to submit a documentary response setting 
forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as appropriate. If you 
do not file any objections or submit any additional information . . . your case will be 
assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination based solely” on the evidence 
set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 3) Applicant submitted three credit reports in response 
to the FORM. Those credit reports noted her credit score was “very poor.”               
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her 
credit reports and SOR response. Applicant’s SOR alleges 17 delinquent, charged-off, 
or collection accounts totaling $34,955. The Government established the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible 
applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;6 and 
                                            
6The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
 Applicant’s conduct in resolving her delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all of her SOR debts. She did not provide 
sufficient information about her finances to establish her inability to make greater 
progress paying her creditors. Underemployment, unemployment, purchase of two 
defective vehicles, and being a single parent of three minor children damaged her family 
finances and are circumstances largely beyond her control; however, she did not 
provide proof that she act responsibly under the circumstances.   
 
 Applicant is credited with resolving the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.h, 1.p, and 1.q.  
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.h for $2,589 is mitigated because it was deleted from one credit 
report, and she said it was a duplication of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c for $3,992. She denied 
responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f for $164, 1.p for $384, and 1.q for $152; she 
utilized a credit repair company to dispute them; and they were removed from all of her 
credit reports.    
 
                                                                                                                                            
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 Applicant did not provide documentation showing her income and expenses, and 
she did not provide a budget. She presented insufficient evidence about what she has 
done since becoming employed with her current employer to pay her SOR debts or her 
other debts. Except as indicated in the previous paragraph, she did not provide any of 
the following documentation relating to the SOR creditors: (1) proof of payments, such 
as checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or a letter from the creditor 
proving that she paid or made any payments to the creditor; (2) correspondence to or 
from any creditors to establish maintenance of contact with creditors;7 (3) a credible 
debt dispute indicating she did not believe she was responsible for the debt and why 
she held such a belief; (4) attempts to negotiate payment plans, such as settlement 
offers or agreements to show that she was attempting to resolve these SOR debts; (5) 
evidence of financial counseling; or (6) other evidence of progress or resolution of her 
SOR debts. 
  
 Applicant’s failure to prove that she has made more substantial steps to resolve 
her debts shows a lack of judgment and responsibility that weighs against approval of 
her security clearance. There is insufficient evidence that she was unable to make 
greater progress resolving her delinquent debts, or that her financial problems are being 
resolved, are under control, and will not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, 
she failed to establish that financial consideration concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
                                            
7“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance. Applicant 
is a 31-year-old bilingual call center operator, who worked for a defense contractor 
since April 2014. Applicant was unemployed from November 2013 to April 2014, 
November 2012 to July 2013, September 2010 to May 2011, May 2007 to July 2007, 
November 2012 to July 2013, and September 2003 to May 2005. See note 5, supra, 
and accompanying text. She was also underemployed during portions of the previous 
ten years. She is separated from her spouse. She is a single parent of three minor 
children. These circumstances beyond her control contributed to her financial problems. 
She has attended college to improve her skills and employment. The debts in SOR ¶ 
1.h for $2,589, ¶ 1.f for $164, ¶ 1.p for $384, and ¶ 1.q for $152 are mitigated. There is 
no evidence of security violations, abuse of alcohol, or use of illegal drugs. She 
disclosed two delinquent debts on her April 12, 2014 SF 86. 
The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more 
substantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial problems. Her SOR alleges 
17 delinquent, charged-off, or collection accounts totaling $34,955. Although she 
mitigated 4 of the 17 SOR debts, she failed to provide sufficient documentation of 
progress to resolve her financial problems. She did not provide any evidence of 
payments to SOR creditors, payment plans, or her communications to SOR creditors, 
showing her attempts to resolve her SOR debts. Her failure to provide more 
corroborating documentation shows lack of financial responsibility and judgment and 
raises unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18. More information about inability to pay 
debts or documented financial progress is necessary to mitigate security concerns. 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to 
Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a 
determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary to 
justify the award of a security clearance in the future. With more effort towards 
documented resolution of her past-due debts, and a track record of behavior consistent 
with her obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her 
security clearance worthiness. Based on the facts before me and the adjudicative 
guidelines that I am required to apply, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility at this time. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial considerations concerns are 
not mitigated.

Subparagraph 1.g:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.h:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.i through 1.o:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.p and 1.q:  For Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
