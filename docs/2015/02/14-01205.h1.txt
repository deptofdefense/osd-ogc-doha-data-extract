HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 26 delinquent, collection, or 
charged-off accounts, totaling $29,287. She did not make sufficient progress resolving 
her financial problems to mitigate financial considerations concerns. Personal conduct 
concerns are mitigated because she did not intend to deceive the Government when 
she failed to list all of her financial problems on her Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of an application for a public trust position (SF 
86). Her eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 21, 2013, Applicant submitted an SF 86. (GE 1) On May 9, 2014, 
the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an 
SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended; DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 
1987, as amended (Regulation); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) as revised by the 
Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence on August 30, 2006, which became 
effective on September 1, 2006.

The SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines F (financial 
considerations) and E (personal conduct). (HE 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD 
was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue 
Applicant’s eligibility to occupy a public trust position, which entails access to sensitive 
information. (HE 2) The DOD CAF recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether such access to sensitive information should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked. 
 
Applicant provided an undated response to the SOR and requested a hearing. 
(HE 3) On December 15, 2014, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to 
proceed on Applicant’s case. On December 18, 2014, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) assigned Applicant’s case to me. On January 9, 2015, DOHA 
issued a hearing notice, setting Applicant’s hearing for January 13, 2015. (HE 1) 
Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled using video teleconference. Applicant 
waived her right to 15 days of notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing. (Tr. 17-
18) Department Counsel offered three exhibits, and Applicant offered four exhibits. (Tr. 
21-23; GE 1-3; AE A-D) All exhibits were admitted without objection. (Tr. 21, 23) The 
transcript was received on January 22, 2015.    
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.b-1.f, 
1.h-1.i, 1.p-1.s, and 1.v-1.w. She also provided mitigating information. Her admissions 
are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 48-year-old customer service representative employed by a 
defense contractor for about one year. (Tr. 6-7, 24) She has worked for the same 
company for three years. (Tr. 8) She has been working full time for the last four years. 
(Tr. 8) She received her graduate equivalency diploma in 1986. (Tr. 6) She has about 
four college credits. (Tr. 7) She has not served in the military. (Tr. 7) In 1992, she 
married, and in 1999, she was divorced. (Tr. 8-9) In 2002, she married, and in October 
2013, she was divorced. (Tr. 9) Her three children are ages 22, 24, and 25. (Tr. 9) One 
of her children resides with her. (Tr. 9) There is no evidence of security violations or 
drug or alcohol abuse.  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s credit reports reflected and SOR alleges 17 delinquent non-medical 
debts, totaling $26,857 as follows: vehicle collection debts in 1.a ($5,497), 1.b ($4,181), 
1.c ($3,916), and 1.f ($15); student loan collection debts in 1.d ($2,802) and 1.e 
($1,761); landlord collection debts in 1.g ($2,432), 1.h ($2,114), and 1.i ($1,132); 
telecommunications collection debts in 1.j ($1,031), 1.m ($683), 1.p ($212), and 1.t 
($114); collection debts of unspecified origin in 1.n ($637) and 1.u ($113); utility 
collection debt in 1.s ($128); and moving collection debts in 1.u ($113) and 1.v ($89).

Applicant’s credit reports and SOR include nine medical debts, totaling $2,430 as 
follows: 1.k ($934); 1.l ($846); 1.o ($229); 1.q ($137); 1.r ($131); 1.w ($50); 1.x ($42); 
1.y ($32); and 1.z ($29).   
 
In April 2011, Applicant was in a car accident. (Tr. 38) She lost her $14 an hour 
employment, and she was unable to earn as much overtime. (Tr. 38-40, 54) Her income 
was reduced by more than 50%. (Tr. 54) In September 2011, she went to work for $10 
an hour. (Tr. 38-40) She received $5,000 in a personal injury settlement. (Tr. 40) She 
purchased a used car and paid some other debts; however, the car was repossessed 
because she could not keep up with the payments, resulting in the SOR ¶ 1.b collection 
debt for $4,181. (Tr. 40-42) She has a blood disorder, which has resulted in medical 
debts. (Tr. 51) 
 
In 2014, Applicant’s gross pay was $18,567; her net pay after taxes was 
$15,773; and her pay after deductions for various allotments was $9,940. (AE D at 2) 
She paid a state tax levy for $280 in 2014. (AE D at 1) There is some variation in the 
amounts garnished on a monthly basis from her pay for her student loans. In December 
2014, she was garnished $78 every two weeks by automatic payment to address her 
student loans, and in 2014, she paid $2,036 to address her student loans. (AE D at 1) 
She said she has a $100 student loan garnishment every two weeks for the debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d for $2,802 (now reduced to $1,956) and 1.e for $1,761 (now reduced to 
$1,202). (Tr. 32-33, 44-45; GE 3) 
 
Applicant accepted responsibility for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a for $5,497. (Tr. 42) 
and for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c for $3,915, which involved a repossessed vehicle. (Tr. 43) 
She has a non-SOR debt for $3,314 for repossession of another used vehicle in 2014. 
(Tr. 52) Applicant tried to pay the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f for $15; however, the creditor 
refused to accept the money because the creditor said the debt was $3,000 for another 
repossessed vehicle that her son was using. (Tr. 43-44)  
 
Applicant signed a lease with her daughter, and her daughter broke the lease 
resulting in the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.g for $2,432 and 1.h for $2,114, that are duplications 
of each other. (Tr. 29-30, 45) Her daughter broke the lease because another tenant was 
violating the rules, and her daughter moved out. (Tr. 29-30)  
 
Applicant had another broken lease, which resulted in the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i for 
$1,132. (Tr. 46) She has not resolved the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i to 1.z. (Tr. 46-48) She 
explained that she had not made any non-garnishment payments to any SOR creditors. 
She described her difficulty making payments to her SOR creditors as follows: “They 
want $25 a month. I barely make it now. I can’t even afford to live on my own.” (Tr. 48) 
She completed credit counseling on line and learned she is “900 dollars in the hole 
every month.” (Tr. 48) She met with a bankruptcy attorney in October 2014, and she 
intends to file for bankruptcy. (Tr. 50-51, 57-58) She conceded, “My credit is terrible. I 
can’t make any excuses for it.” (Tr. 53) She made her first payment into her legal plan 
for the bankruptcy in January 2015. (Tr. 63) Applicant has not filed her federal and state 
tax returns for 2013. (Tr. 35-36) She did not believe she would owe any taxes when she 
filed. (Tr. 36) She received financial counseling for her bankruptcy. (Tr. 48)

Personal Conduct 
 
 When Applicant completed her November 21, 2013 SF 86, she disclosed that 
she had the following financial problems: she had medical bills (resolved in October and 
November 2013) that became delinquent in 2005 for $1,346 and $1,394, resulting in 
garnishment of her pay; her pay was being garnished for education loans; the debts 
resulting from three repossessed vehicle debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.f; and the debt 
resulting from breach of an apartment lease. (GE 1)  
 
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges Applicant failed to disclose more of her delinquent debts, as 
described in the previous section.  Applicant explained that her employer made her rush 
to complete her SF 86 so that she could return to answering calls at the call center. (Tr. 
60-61) She expressed her remorse about providing incomplete financial information on 
her SF 86. (Tr. 61)   
 
Applicant’s pastor, supervisor, coworker, and friend provided character 
references. (AE A-C) They described her as being devoted to her church, dedicated, 
intelligent, honest, compassionate, loyal, a good example and leader, diligent, 
trustworthy, professional, and a person who strives for improvement. (AE A-C) She 
makes contributions to her employer and DOD. (AE B-C) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Government’s authority to restrict access to 
classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified 
information. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access 
to information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. See Id. at 527.  
 
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”  
Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. “The standard that must be met for . . . 
assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s 
loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to 
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” Regulation ¶ 
C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the 
procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination 
may be made. See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, an 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of 
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the 
whole person. An administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
sensitive information.   
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security and trustworthiness suitability. See 
ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance [or access to sensitive information].” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity 
clearance [or trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
The protection of the national security and sensitive records is of paramount 
consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national 
security.” Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in 
terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty 
of the applicant concerned.” 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern relating to financial problems: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a trustworthiness 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s SOR and 
credit reports allege 26 delinquent, collection, or charged-off accounts, totaling $29,287. 
 
  In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board 
explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. (internal 
citation omitted).  
 
The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.  
  
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and 
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving her delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all of her SOR debts; however, she provided 
some mitigating information. In April 2011, Applicant was in a car accident. She lost her 
$14 an hour employment, and she was unable to earn as much overtime. Her income 
was reduced by more than 50%. In September 2011, she went to work for $10 an hour. 
She has a blood disorder, which has resulted in medical debts. She was divorced in 
2013. These are circumstances largely beyond her control. 
 
Applicant receives some credit for the funds paid to her creditors through 
garnishment in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e. SOR ¶¶ 1.g for $2,432 and 1.h for $2,114 are 
duplications of each other, and Applicant is credited with mitigating the debt in SOR ¶ 
1.h as a duplication. 
 
Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances. She received ample 
notice of her delinquent debts raising trustworthiness concerns. Applicant did not 
                                                                                                                                            
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
provide sufficient information about her finances to establish her inability to voluntarily 
pay her SOR creditors anything. She received financial counseling. She said her 
expenses exceeded her income by $900 monthly. She did not explain how she was 
either going to increase her income or decrease her expenses to balance her budget.    
 
In sum, Applicant conceded that she did not make any payments to any of her 
SOR creditors, except for her wages that are being garnished.3 There is no financial 
documentation relating to any of her SOR creditors showing maintenance of contact 
with creditors4 or other evidence of progress or resolution of her SOR debts. There is 
insufficient evidence that her financial problems are being resolved, are under control, 
and will not occur in the future. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the trustworthiness concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
One personal conduct disqualifying condition under AG ¶ 16 is potentially 
applicable. AG ¶ 16(a) provides, “(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of 
relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct 
investigations, . . . [to] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . . .”5 
                                            
3Of course, Applicant loses some mitigating credit because some debt payments were made 
through garnishment of her salary even though her opportunity to establish a payment plan was limited 
because of her limited income and other financial commitments. Payment of a debt “though garnishment 
rather than a voluntary effort diminishes its mitigating force.” Compare ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 4 
(App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2010) with ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (payment of two 
of four debts through garnishment did not bar mitigation of financial considerations concerns). 
  
4“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
5The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the

Applicant’s November 21, 2013 SF 86 asked about her finances, and she 
disclosed that she had medical and education debts as well as debts from three 
repossessed vehicles and a debt resulting from breach of an apartment lease. SOR ¶ 
2.a alleges Applicant failed to disclose more of her delinquent debts. Applicant 
explained that her employer made her rush to complete her SF 86 so that she could 
return to answering calls at the call center.    
 
Applicant’s failure to disclose full information about her delinquent debts was 
erroneous; however, it was not a deliberate decision made with intent to conceal 
adverse information about her worthiness to receive access to sensitive information. 
Her mistaken failure to provide complete information was not made with intent to 
deceive; she put the Government on notice that she had financial problems; she refuted 
the allegation of intentional concealment of financial information; and personal conduct 
concerns are mitigated. See also AG ¶ 17(f) (mitigating condition stating “the 
information was unsubstantiated . . .”). 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
Applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors 
in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional 
comment. 
 
                                                                                                                                            
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the 
burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the 
omission.  
 
ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 
2004)).

There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance. Applicant 
is a 48-year-old customer service representative employed by a defense contractor for 
about one year. She has worked for the same company for three years. She has been 
working full time for the last four years. There is no evidence of security violations, or 
drug or alcohol abuse. Some circumstances beyond her control adversely affected her 
finances, including medical problems, reduction in income, and divorce. Applicant’s 
pastor, supervisor, coworker, and friend described her as being devoted to her church, 
dedicated, intelligent, honest, compassionate, loyal, a good example and leader, 
diligent, trustworthy, professional, and a person who strives for improvement. She 
contributes to her company and the Department of Defense.  
 
The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more 
substantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial problems. Applicant’s credit 
reports and SOR allege 26 delinquent, collection, or charged-off accounts, totaling 
$29,287. Her monthly expenses substantially exceed her income. Even after crediting 
her with mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, and 1.h, she still has 23 delinquent 
SOR debts totaling $22,610. Her failure to show greater progress by at least paying 
some of her SOR debts that were less than $100 indicates lack of financial 
responsibility and judgment and raises unmitigated questions about Applicant’s 
reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect sensitive information. See AG ¶ 18. 
More financial progress and time without criminal offenses is necessary to mitigate 
trustworthiness concerns. 
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s eligibility for 
a public trust position, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
public trust position. Unmitigated financial considerations concerns lead me to conclude 
that reinstatement of a public trust position to Applicant is not warranted at this time. 
This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will 
not attain the state of reform necessary to justify the award of a public trust position in 
the future. With more effort towards resolving her past-due debts, and a track record of 
behavior consistent with her obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate 
persuasive evidence of her worthiness for a security clearance.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated; however, financial considerations 
concerns are not mitigated. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible 
for access to classified information at this time.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.c:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e:  For Applicant  
Subparagraphs 1.f and 1.g:  Against Applicant   
Subparagraph 1.h:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.i to 1.z:   Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 2.a:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust 
position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.
