DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns arising under Guidelines F, financial 
considerations. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing 
(e-QIP) on July 3, 2013, seeking a security clearance. On June 13, 2014, the 
Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) 
detailing security concerns under Guideline F. This action was taken under Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 
1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant a security clearance. On September 25, 2014, Applicant answered the SOR.

On October 27, 2014, he indicated that he elected to have his case decided on the 
written record in lieu of a hearing. On November 12, 2014, Department Counsel 
prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) that contained documents marked as 
Items 1 through 8. On November 13, 2014, a copy of the FORM was mailed to 
Applicant, giving him 30 days from its receipt to submit objections or supply additional 
information. He did not submit a response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me 
on February 4, 2015.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 
February 2012, which was dismissed in March 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.a); that he was indebted 
to the bankruptcy court for an unpaid filing fee of $206 (SOR ¶ 1.b); that he failed to file 
his federal income tax returns for 2009, 2010, and 2011 as required (SOR ¶ 1.c); that 
he had an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax lien entered against him for $10,369 in 
June 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.d); that he had a state tax lien entered against him for $3,956 in 
January 2009 (SOR 1.e); and that he had nine delinquent debts totaling about $119,589 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.f-1.n). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each allegation. His 
admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.1 
 
 Applicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
working for that contractor since September 2011. He served in the U.S. Army Reserve 
(inactive) from 1983 to 1995 and was honorably discharged. He took college and 
technical training courses in 2008 and 2009, but has not apparently earned a degree or 
certification. He is married and has four children, ages, 12, 28, 32, and 34. He is 
seeking a security clearance for the first time.2 
 
 Applicant was unemployed from November 2010 to September 2011, after 
leaving a job because he was informed his performance was unsatisfactory. He was 
also unemployed from December 2008 to August 2009, after being laid off from that job. 
No other explanation was provided for his financial problems.3 
 
 Applicant filed a pro se Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in February 2012. The 
petition indicated that Applicant estimated that he had between 1-49 creditors, 
$100,000-$500,000 in estimated assets, and $100,000-$500,000 in estimated liabilities. 
The bankruptcy records contained a notice of filing deficiencies advising Applicant of his 
failure to file a creditor matrix as well as the following documents: 
 
 Statement of Financial Affairs (Form 7); 
 Schedules A thru J; 
                                                          
1 Items 1, 4, 6, and 7. 
 
2 Item 5.  
 
3 Item 5. 
 
 
3 
 
 
 Summary of Schedules, Page 1 (Form 6 – Summary); 
 Statistical Summary (Form 6 – Summary); 
 Declaration Concerning Debtor’s Schedules (Form 6); 
 Statement of Current Monthly Income (Form 22C); 
 Chapter 13 Plan, complete with signatures; 
 Certificate of Credit Counseling; and 
 Pay Advices: Copies of Pay Stubs. 
 
Applicant was given 14 days to correct the noted deficiencies. On February 28, 2012, 
his Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed for failing to file the creditor matrix within the 
period allotted. The bankruptcy records also reflected he owed a filing fee balance of 
$206. No proof was provided to show the delinquent filing fee has been resolved.4 
 
 In his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that he failed to file his federal income tax 
returns for 2009, 2010, and 2011 because he did not funds available to pay the income 
taxes. He did not specifically state that he filed those tax returns, but did indicate that he 
entered into an agreement with the IRS in March 2013 to make biweekly payments of 
$100 via a payroll deduction. No proof of the agreement or the periodic payments was 
provided. In the e-QIP, he also indicated that he is working on a payment plan for a 
delinquent student loan and provided no proof of those efforts.5 
 
 A credit report dated July 31, 2013, contained entries reflecting the alleged tax 
liens and debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.n. A credit report dated October 27, 2014, reflected the 
following:  
 
 a. The mortgage loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f was modified under a Federal 
Government plan and the alleged past-due amount had been reduced from $53,652 to 
$11,129.  
 
 b. The charged-off student loan for $844 in SOR ¶ 1.k was paid.  
 
 c. The balances of the delinquent debts in SOR ¶ 1.g, 1.i, and 1.j had increased. 
 
 d. The federal and state tax liens remained unchanged. 
 
 e. The balance of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.n remained unchanged. 
 
                                                          
4 Item 8.  
5 Item 5.

The latest credit report did not reflect the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.l, and 1.m, and it is 
unknown what, if any, action was taken regards those debts.6 
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, in reaching a decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
                                                          
6 Items 6 and 7. Applicant’s credit report of July 31, 2013, reflected a higher balance ($28,217) for a 
charged-off student loan than that was alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g ($26,499).

“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(g) failure to file annual Federal . . . income tax returns as required . . . . 
 
 In February 2012, Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which was dismissed 
shortly after being filed. He failed to file his federal income tax returns for 2009, 2010, 
and 2011 as required. He accumulated two tax liens and nine delinquent debts that he 
was unable or unwilling to satisfy for an extended period. The evidence is sufficient to 
raise the above disqualifying conditions. 
 
  Four financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
6 
 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 In 2008 and 2009, Applicant was unemployed for about nine months after being 
laid off from a job. In 2010 and 2011, he was unemployed for about 11 months after 
leaving a job for performance issues. His first period of unemployment and possibly the 
second period resulted from conditions beyond his control that contributed to his 
financial problems. The evidence shows that he was able to modify his mortgage loan 
and reduce the past-due amount owed on that loan. He also paid off a small student 
debt for $884. Other than those actions, little is known about what steps, if any, 
Applicant has taken to resolve the remaining debts. He stated that he entered in an 
agreement with the IRS and was making payments on his past-due federal income 
taxes, but he provided no proof of the agreement or payments. Likewise, he provided no 
proof of a purported repayment agreement on a student loan. He did not provide a 
sufficient explanation for failing to file his federal income tax returns as required. His 
delinquent debts are ongoing and significant. From the evidence presented, I am unable 
to find that his financial problems are under control, are unlikely to recur, and do not 
cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I am also 
unable to find that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG ¶¶ 20(b) and 
20(d) partially apply. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(c) do not apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
In the adjudication process, an administrative judge must carefully weigh a 
number of variables known as the whole-person concept. Available information about 
the applicant as well as the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a) should be considered in reaching 
a determination.7 In this case, I gave due consideration to the information about 
                                                          
7 The administrative judge should consider the adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
7 
 
 
Applicant in the record and concluded the favorable information, including the mitigating 
evidence, does not outweigh the security concerns at issue. Applicant failed to meet his 
burden of persuasion. His handling of his financial problems leaves me with doubts as 
to his current eligibility for access to classified information. Following the Egan decision 
and the “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard, doubts about granting 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance must be resolved in favor of national 
security.  
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive 
are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    Against Applicant 
 
 Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.e:  Against Applicant 
 Subparagraph 1.f:    For Applicant 
 Subparagraphs 1.g – 1.j:   Against Applicant 
 Subparagraph 1.k:    For Applicant 
 Subparagraphs 1.l – 1.n:   Against Applicant 
 
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Clearance is denied.
