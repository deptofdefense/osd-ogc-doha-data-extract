Applicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 29, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns 
under Guideline F. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD CAF could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Applicant answered the SOR on August

26, 2014, and requested a hearing on October 10, 2014. This case was assigned to me 
on November 19, 2014. On November 24, 2014, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling the hearing for December 10, 
2014. The hearing was held as scheduled.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 and 6, 
while Applicant testified and offered Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A and B. The record of the 
hearing was held open until January 7, 2015, to provide the Applicant the opportunity to 
submit additional documents. He timely submitted documents that were marked as AE 
C though G. Applicant’s objection to GE 3 (Chapter 11 bankruptcy records) was 
overruled. All of the other proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without 
objection. Department Counsel’s memorandum forwarding Applicant’s post-hearing 
submission was marked as Hearing Exhibit 1. The transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was 
received on December 22, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 67-year-old manager who works part time for a federal contractor. 
He also owns and operates a building services business. He graduated from high 
school in 1965, served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1966-1968, including combat duty 
in Vietnam, and was honorably discharged. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1974. He 
married in 1969 and was widowed in 2005. He remarried in 2009. He has two children, 
ages 36 and 42. In the past, he held a security clearance without incident.1 
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant’s business filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 
October 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.a), that Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in December 
2008 (SOR ¶ 1.b), that he owed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $217,231 in unpaid 
payroll taxes (SOR ¶ 1.c), that he owed the IRS $15,287 for a trust fund penalty (SOR ¶ 
1.d); and that he had five state tax liens totaling $41,420 (SOR ¶¶ 1.e–1.i). In his 
Answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a–1.g, denied the 
allegation in SOR ¶ 1.h, and neither admitted or denied the allegation in SOR ¶¶ 1.i. His 
admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.2 
 
After completing college, Applicant worked in a variety of jobs. He eventually was 
employed by a company that provided building services. The partners who ran that 
company were elderly, and he eventually purchased the company from them. His 
company was incorporated in 1986, had about 15 employees, and was certified as a 
Small Business Administration (SBA) entity. Under the SBA program, his company was 
awarded building service contracts at military bases and other federal facilities. Over the 
years, his business expanded to other states and included at least one overseas

contract. His business grew to about 800 employees and, at some point, became 
ineligible for SBA contracts, but bid on other competitive federal contracts.3 
 
Applicant noted that his business did not qualify for federal contracts under the 
Javits-Wagner-O’Day Act of 1971, which provides that federal agencies must purchase 
specified supplies and services from nonprofit agencies employing persons who are 
blind or have other significant disabilities. Implementation of that Act began to impact 
his business in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Due to the Act, he lost a number of his 
federal contracts to qualifying nonprofit agencies. Nevertheless, he stated, prior to the 
economic downtown of 2006 and 2008, he always paid his bills on time, did not incur 
any delinquent debts, and had an excellent credit rating. The economic downturn, 
however, had a significant impact on his business. During the downturn, major 
companies cut back on their service contracts with his company. Some of his contracts 
were reduced by as much as 35-40%. This economic downturn had a substantial 
negative impact on his business and resulted in his company not being able to meet its 
financial obligations.4  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a – Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. To survive the economic downturn, 
Applicant’s company reorganized under a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. He noted that, in 
filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2008, he chose to work with his creditors so that 
they would get paid as opposed to shutting down the business and walking away from 
the debts. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy listed that his company had $513,463 in assets 
and $991,962 in liabilities. A reorganization plan was proposed to the creditors and 
confirmed by the bankruptcy court in August 2009. One of the liabilities was a $650,065 
secured claim on his company’s building. As part of the bankruptcy proceeding, the 
building was surrendered to the creditor. His company moved to another building that it 
currently rents with an option to buy. His payments under the Chapter 11 reorganization 
plan are discussed under the debts addressed in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.e-1.h, below. He 
testified that suppliers are again extending credit to his company.5 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b – Chapter 13 Bankuptcy. In December 2012, Applicant filed Chapter 
13 bankruptcy because business creditors were proceeding against him personally after 
his business filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. His Chapter 13 bankruptcy listed $284,830 in 
assets and $1,016,257 in liabilities. One of the liabilities was an IRS trust fund penalty 
(SOR ¶ 1.d) for $15,287, which apparently arose from his company’s failure to pay IRS 
payroll taxes as required (discussed below). His Chapter 13 Plan provided that he 
would initially pay $1,500 monthly, with those payments increasing to $1,600 in 
November 2009. The payments were to be made for 60 months. Additionally, the plan 
provided that Applicant would pay the IRS only $12,139 for the trust fund penalty 
because that was the amount approved by the bankruptcy trustee. On September 15,

2014, this bankruptcy was discharged. The trustee’s final report reflected that the IRS 
trust fund penalty was paid; $105,877 was disbursed to creditors; and $724,652 in 
unsecured claims was discharged without payment.6 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c – IRS debt of $217,231 for Unpaid Payroll Taxes. This debt was 
listed in Applicant’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but not in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy. The 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition reflected this debt was disputed. An IRS Proof of Claim 
reflected that this debt consisted of secured claims totaling $150,314 and unsecured 
claims totaling $66,917. The Chapter 11 reorganization plan provided that Applicant’s 
company would pay $2,800 per month to the IRS for not more than five years for the 
secured claims totaling $105,314 and pay $1,700 per month for not more than five 
years for unsecured claims totaling $102,000 from federal, state, and local taxing 
authorities. The monthly payments of $2,800 to the IRS on the secured claims were at 
some point reduced to $2,000. Applicant provided proof that he made periodic 
payments to the IRS from January 2010 to December 2014 that totaled $185,600 
toward the secured claims. At the time of the hearing, he was still making the monthly 
payments to the IRS.7 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.e-1.g – State Tax Liens for $18,447, $15,215, and $5,648, 
respectively. These tax liens were from the state in which Applicant resides and where 
his company’s main office is located. The underlying tax debts for these liens were 
apparently grouped together in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy as part of the unsecured tax 
claims from federal, state, and local taxing authorities. In his Answer to the SOR, 
Applicant provided a document signed by state tax auditor showing that the taxes owed 
under his Department of Labor employer account have been paid in full as of August 26, 
2014. In his post-hearing submission, he provided documents from the state taxing 
authority showing that tax liens for $18,447, $15,215, $5,648, $21,278, and $5,630 were 
satisfied.8 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h – State Tax Lien for $784. This lien was for property taxes that 
Applicant owed on two parcels of land. This debt was paid in July 2012.9 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i – State Tax Lien for $1,326. This tax lien is from a state in which 
Applicant does not reside. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy listed that taxes were owed to

7 Tr. 44, 52-59; AE E, F, G; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. Applicant was not questioned about 
the unsecured portion of the IRS claim and did not provide documentation showing proof of payments 
toward the unsecured portion. However, his payments toward the unsecured state tax liens in SOR ¶¶ 
1.e-1.h supports a finding that he was making the $1,700 monthly payments under Chapter 11 for the 
unsecured federal, state, and local tax liability. The reorganization plan noted the IRS secured claims 
accrued interest at a rate of 4%.

this state. Applicant testified that, when he contacted the state official about these taxes, 
he was informed that nothing could be done because of the “stay” on collection while his 
bankruptcy was pending. The officials informed him that they would not discuss this 
matter until six months after his bankruptcy was completed. He indicated this debt was 
not resolved, but would be resolved. Of note, it is likely this debt will be resolved as part 
of his Chapter 11 bankruptcy.10 
 
Applicant received financial counseling when he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy. In 
2013, his company’s revenue was about $1.4 million. He testified that his company then 
had about 85-95 employees, with most of them working on a part-time basis. He has not 
recently taken a salary or any income from his company while it is undergoing the 
Chapter 11 reorganization. He stated everyone else has to be paid before he is paid. He 
lives on a military retirement, Social Security payments, and income from rental 
properties.11 
 
In Vietnam, Applicant was assigned to a unit that was awarded two Presidential 
Unit Citations. He was wounded twice in combat and received two Purple Heart Medals. 
He was apparently medically retired from the military due to his wounds.12 
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, to reach his decision.

11 Tr. 31, 33, 69-74; AE A. 
12 Tr. 36-37.

The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
 
7 
 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant incurred delinquent debts that he was unable to pay for an extended 
period. He filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2008. His company filed Chapter 11 
bankruptcy in 2008. This evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying 
conditions. 
 
  Four mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.  
 
 An economic downturn negatively impacted Applicant’s company in 2006 and 
2007. This economic downturn was a condition beyond his control that caused his 
financial problems. To survive the downturn, Applicant’s company filed Chapter 11 
bankruptcy. He also filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy to preclude his company’s creditors 
from proceeding against him personally on the company’s debts. He obtained financial 
counseling when he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy. He is complying with the requirements 
of the bankruptcies. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy is discharged, while the Chapter 11 
bankruptcy is ongoing. As part of the bankruptcy proceedings, Applicant has resolved 
the IRS trust fund penalty in SOR ¶ 1.c and the state tax liens in SOR ¶ 1.d-1.h. He is 
making regular payments on the past-due payroll taxes in SOR ¶ 1.c and the amount of 
those payroll taxes has been significantly reduced. A state taxing authority advised 
Applicant that nothing could be done regarding the tax lien in SOR ¶ 1.i while his 
bankruptcy was pending. Of note, a tax liability owed to the state identified in SOR ¶ 1.i 
was listed in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and the tax lien in that allegation may be 
resolved as part of that bankruptcy proceeding. Applicant has acted responsibly under 
 
8 
 
 
the circumstances. His financial problems are under control, are being resolved and are 
unlikely to recur. AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies.    
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).  
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
While in the Marine Corps, Applicant engaged in combat duty in Vietnam. He 
was awarded two Purple Heart Medals and was medically retired. He is a hard-working 
individual who has been operating his own company for a number of years. His 
company encountered financial problems during a recession in 2006 and 2007. He has 
been working hard to recover from those financial setbacks. At present, his Chapter 13 
bankruptcy is discharged, his financial situation is stable, and his company’s Chapter 11 
bankruptcy should be completed in the near future. He has acted reasonably and 
responsibly in addressing his financial problems. He is well on the road to financial 
recovery. His financial problems appear to be behind him. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude that Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.    
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   For Applicant 
 
   Subparagraphs 1.a-1.i:  For Applicant 
    
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is granted.
