GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations and 
personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information 
is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 11, 2012, Applicant applied for a non-sensitive position and 
submitted a Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions (SF 85).1 On February 6, 2014, 
Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security Clearance Application.2 On July 
28, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility – 
Division A (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel

Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified 
(Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to 
Classified Information (effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all 
adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged 
security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal 
Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators could not make an 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. In a sworn statement, dated August 18, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On November 13, 
2014, Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The 
case was assigned to me on November 17, 2014. A Notice of Hearing was issued on 
December 2, 2014. I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on December 18, 2014. 
 
 During the hearing, seven Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 7) and five 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE E) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on January 6, 2015. I 
kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of 
that opportunity. He submitted additional documents which were marked as AE F 
through AE J and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on 
December 30, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted five of the factual allegations in the 
SOR under financial considerations (¶¶ 1.d., 1.e., 1.j., 1.l., and 1.m.). He initially failed to 
address one of the allegations but subsequently denied it. Applicant’s admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as a maintenance mechanic since November 2011.3 He was laid off in May 
2011 and remained unemployed until November 2011.4 A May 1992 high school 
graduate,5 Applicant attended a college for some time, but did not earn a degree.6 He

was granted a secret security clearance in 1995,7 but the current status of that security 
clearance is not known. He does, however, have a public trust access. Applicant served 
in an enlisted capacity with the U.S. Marine Corps from June 1992 until November 
1999, and he received an honorable discharge.8 He also was a member of the U.S. Air 
Force Inactive Reserve from March 2009 until November 2011.9  
 
During his period of military service, Applicant was awarded the Meritorious Unit 
Commendation (with one star), the Good Conduct Medal (with one star), the National 
Defense Service Medal, the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, the Sea Service Deployment 
Ribbon (with one star), and the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. He also received a 
Meritorious Mast.10 Applicant was married three times: he was married in February 
1993, and divorced in August 1997; married in June 1996, and divorced in November 
2003; and married in December 2007.11 He has two children: a daughter born in 1994 
and a son born in 2006.12 
 
Financial Considerations 
It is unclear as to when Applicant started experiencing financial difficulties as he 
never furnished any explanation regarding the earliest years of such difficulties except 
to refer to money being tight because his wife was not working, his son had some 
medical issues, and they had relocated. There are, however, several delinquent 
accounts as early as 2007 and 2008 that appear in his October 2012 credit report.13 
Applicant’s supervisor until January 2008 reported in November 2012 that for the past 
four years he had been dealing with collections and debt recovery calls pertaining to 
Applicant.14  
The SOR initially identified 13 purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected 
by credit reports from October 2012,15 February 2014,16 and October 2014,17 totaling

approximately $12,036. At the commencement of the hearing Department Counsel 
moved to amend the SOR by withdrawing two of the allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.e. and 1.f.). 
There being no objection, the motion was granted and the two allegations were 
withdrawn.18 Those remaining debts listed in the SOR and their respective current 
status, according to the credit reports, other evidence in the case file, and Applicant’s 
admissions regarding the same, are described below. 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): There was a medical account for Applicant’s son in the amount of 
$1,243 that went to judgment in December 2010.19 Applicant was unable to pay the bill 
in 2008 when his son dislocated his shoulder because he did not have medical 
insurance.20  He claimed he was unaware of the judgment; had not received any bills or 
notices other than a few telephone calls; and only became aware of the judgment in 
2011 when he was in the process of purchasing a new residence.21 Commencing in 
February 2014 – five months before the SOR was issued - Applicant made three 
monthly $100 payments to the collection agent.22 In March 2014, Applicant was 
interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), 
and he indicated he was making the monthly payments on the account, and he 
estimated he would satisfy the account by June 2014.23 On July 22, 2014, after 
Applicant had repaid the entire remaining balance, the collection agent filed a 
satisfaction of judgment with the court.24 The account has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): There is a utility and fuel account with a high credit and past-due 
balance of $436 that was delinquent during the last three months of 2007, placed for 
collection, and charged off in January 2008.25 When Applicant’s wife learned about the 
account, Applicant contacted the utility company to validate the account contending he 
had never received service from that particular utility as he resided outside of their 
service area.26 He requested documentation indicating that he had signed up for the 
service, but the utility refused to furnish any documentation, claiming Applicant’s social 
security number was on the account.27 It is Applicant’s opinion that his ex-wife (not 
other-wise identified) was responsible for using his name for the account following their

divorce.28 The matter is at a standstill with the creditor’s refusal to furnish Applicant 
written validation of the account and Applicant’s refusal to accept responsibility for the 
account in the absence of validation. Nevertheless, without some documentation to 
support Applicant’s contentions such as written communications between the parties, or 
a printed map of the utility service areas and the locations of Applicant’s residences 
within or without of those service areas, this issue has not been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): There is a cable account with a high credit and past-due balance of 
$566 that was placed for collection in 2008.29 Applicant contended the charge was for a 
cable box that was not returned when he moved, but that once he unpacked following 
the move, he eventually returned the cable box to the cable company and received a 
receipt for it.30 Unfortunately, the collection agent and the original creditor apparently 
differed on the status of the account, and Applicant filed a dispute through a credit 
repair firm.31 On November 13, 2014, the account was removed from his TransUnion 
Credit Report.32 It no longer appears in his October 2014 Equifax Credit Report.33 
Applicant is awaiting the results of the dispute with the remaining credit reporting 
service.34 The account has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): There is a medical account for Applicant’s son with a high credit 
and past-due balance of $271 that was placed for collection in 2012.35 This was one of 
several medical accounts that Applicant was unable to pay because he did not have 
medical insurance.  Applicant initially claimed he had paid off the account, but he was 
confused as he had paid another medical account with the same collection agent (SOR 
¶ 1.e.).36 During the hearing he contended he also paid this account, and that he is 
awaiting receipt of documentation to reflect that fact.37 He subsequently disputed the 
account with Equifax, and while Equifax acknowledged the dispute, no decision had yet 
been made as of October 31, 2014.38 While Applicant has not submitted any 
documentation to support his contention that the account has been paid, it, 
nevertheless, appears that the account is in the process of being resolved.

(SOR ¶ 1.g.): There is an automobile lease/purchase account that was opened in 
2005 in the approximate amount of $13,000. Applicant made some monthly payments 
before he returned the vehicle. At that point, since he relinquished the vehicle, under the 
terms of the agreement, the agreement was cancelled and Applicant owed no further 
money. In November 2008, the vehicle was stolen from the dealer’s lot. During the 
ensuing police investigation, Applicant was interviewed and he explained that he had 
turned the vehicle in about one year earlier. The dealer filed an insurance claim for the 
loss and, in January 2013, filed a collection claim against Applicant reflecting a high 
credit of $6,007 and a past-due balance of $6,787.39 Applicant explained the situation to 
the collection attorney in May 2014, and because he has not received any further 
communication from that attorney, he assumed the matter was resolved.40 The account 
no longer appears in his October 2014 Equifax Credit Report.41 The account has been 
resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.h.): There is a bank checking account with a high credit and past-due 
balance of $151 that was placed for collection and eventually sold to a “factoring 
company.”42 Applicant filed a dispute through his credit repair firm,43 and on November 
13, 2014, the account was removed from his TransUnion Credit Report.44 It no longer 
appears in his October 2014 Equifax Credit Report.45 Applicant was initially unaware of 
the collection agent, but once it was revealed that the account was related to his 
checking account that was purportedly closed in good standing, he accepted 
responsibility for it.46 Despite the current status of the account and because he is tired of 
dealing with his delinquent accounts, Applicant intends to pay this account “so [he] can 
proceed on with [his] life.”47  The account has not been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): There is a satellite television account with a high credit and unpaid 
balance of $448 that was placed for collection and eventually sold to a debt purchaser.48 
Applicant denied that he had ever had a satellite television account and contended he 
always had cable service.49 Applicant filed a dispute through his credit repair firm,50 and

it no longer appears in his October 2014 Equifax Credit Report.51 The account has been 
resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.j.): There is a trash collection service account with an unpaid balance 
of $152 that was placed for collection in 2013.52 Applicant was unaware that there was 
still a balance until he first learned that fact during his OPM interview. He initially 
thought his wife had taken care of the account, but it had apparently “slipped through 
the cracks.”53 He paid the bill in cash in April 2014, but is not sure where the location of 
the receipt might be.54 The account no longer appears in his October 2014 Equifax 
Credit Report.55 The account has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.k.): There is an automobile insurance account with an unpaid balance 
of $226 that was placed for collection in January 2014.56 Applicant was unable to make 
the final payment in December 2013 because of Christmas expenses, so he made it 
online the following month, in January 2014.57 While he has no documentation to 
confirm his payment, the account no longer appears in his October 2014 Equifax Credit 
Report.58 The account has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.l. and 1.m.): There are two returned checks in the amounts of $65 and 
$23 that were placed for collection.59 There is some inconsistency regarding the facts 
on these two checks. The payees of the checks were never identified and Applicant did 
not explain the circumstances surrounding their issuance.  During his March 2014 OPM 
interview, Applicant claimed to be unaware of the accounts.60 In his Answer to the SOR, 
he stated that the accounts would be paid by November 1, 2014.61 They were not. 
During the December 2014 hearing, Applicant revised his memory and stated that he 
was aware of the checks in 2011, but had forgotten about them because of their 
respective low amounts.62 Applicant’s credit repair firm verified the accounts, and

Applicant stated he intended to pay both accounts the week following the hearing.63  
Applicant has not submitted any documentation to confirm that either account has been 
paid. The accounts have not been resolved. 
  
In December 2014, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement that 
reflected a combined gross monthly income of $5,200 and total monthly expenses of 
$4,227. That left him with an estimated monthly surplus of $973 available for 
discretionary savings or spending.64 It is unclear if the numbers are accurate, for 
Applicant’s wife pays monthly child support of $450, and that payment is not specifically 
listed as such.65 Applicant’s annual salary has increased since he started working for his 
current employer, and he now earns about $55,000 per year.66 Applicant and his wife try 
to budget as much as possible, but both of them have bad credit ratings because of 
their divorces, and their respective low credit scores cause higher interest rates and 
higher payments. They have reduced expenses, paid off student loans, satisfied liens, 
and paid off all their other delinquent accounts.67  
 
As noted above, in late April or early May 2014, Applicant engaged the 
professional services of a law firm serving as a credit repair firm to assist him in 
reviewing his delinquent accounts, analyzing his responsibilities, seeking validation of 
the accounts, disputing certain accounts, and resolving errors in the credit reports. He 
pays them $119 per month.68 The firm also provided Applicant with valuable guidance 
as he continues to manage his credit.69  
 
Personal Conduct 
 
 (SOR ¶ 2.a.): On February 6, 2014, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he 
responded to questions pertaining to his financial record. Two of those questions in 
Section 26 – Financial Record (Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts) – asked if, in 
the last seven years, he had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; and if he 
had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as 
agreed. Applicant answered “no” to those questions. He certified that the response was 
“true, complete, and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief,70 but the response

to those questions was, in fact, false for at that time Applicant had several accounts that 
were either placed for collection, charged off, or cancelled. He subsequently explained 
that when he completed the e-QIP he was doing so from his memory and had not given 
serious thought to the questions. In addition, he thought a lot of the accounts that might 
have been listed actually fell outside the seven–year window of the questions and that 
they had already been dropped from his credit report.71 To his credit, Applicant did 
identify a delinquent student loan. He denied having “malicious intent” to falsify his 
responses.72 
 
Character References 
 
 One of Applicant’s co-workers, who is also a good friend, has characterized 
Applicant in very favorable terms. Applicant is “completely honest,” a loving husband, 
outstanding father, and a “huge asset to [the] shop.”73 
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”74 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”75   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider

all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”76 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.77  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”78 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”79 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Various accounts were placed for collection or charged off, and a 
judgment against him was obtained by one of his creditors. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) 
apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”80 In addition, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply if “the individual has a reasonable 
                                                          
80
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem 
and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) all partially apply. Applicant’s financial 
problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend 
beyond his means. Instead, as noted above, Applicant’s initial significant financial 
problems started some time in 2007 or 2008 because money was tight due to his wife 
not working, his son had some medical issues, and they had relocated. While those 
issues may have had some negative impact on Applicant’s finances, it remains unclear 
as what degree they may have been beyond Applicant’s control. His six-month period of 
unemployment in 2011 certainly did not help him. It is apparent, however, that Applicant 
took a variety of steps to prioritize his accounts to enable him to pay some of them and 
delay paying others.  
My impression of Applicant is that he is substantially naive about financial 
matters, although he seems to be gaining increasing knowledge from his experiences 
with his creditors and his credit repair firm. Applicant’s knowledge of his accounts is 
relatively poor. He was easily confused if there were more than one account with a 
creditor or collection agent. This confusion is somewhat understandable since 
Applicant’s wife handled some of the accounts and Applicant handled others. Once all 
of his delinquent accounts were specified and the original creditors identified, 
Applicant’s resolution efforts increased. Some accounts were paid well before 
Applicant’s SOR was issued. Other accounts were disputed for a variety of reasons, 
and several of them were removed from his credit reports. With the assistance of his 
credit repair firm, as well as independently, he is currently addressing those accounts 
that have not yet been resolved. 
Applicant has received some financial counseling from his credit repair firm. 
Nevertheless, all of Applicant’s newer accounts appear to be current. He has resolved 
many of the accounts alleged in the SOR as well as some accounts that were not in the 
SOR. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are finally under 
control. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting him, do not cast doubt 
on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.81 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG & 15:       
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful

and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
 The guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns. Under AG ¶ 
16(a), it is potentially disqualifying if there is a 
deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
 As noted above, on February 6, 2014, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he 
responded to certain questions pertaining to his financial record. The questions in 
Section 26 – Financial Record asked if, in the past seven years, he had bills or debts 
turned over to a collection agency; and if he had any account or credit card suspended, 
charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed. Applicant answered “no” to those 
questions. He certified that the responses were “true, complete, and correct” to the best 
of his knowledge and belief, but the responses to those questions were, in fact, false.  
 
 Applicant’s responses provide sufficient evidence to examine if his submissions 
were deliberate falsifications, as alleged in the SOR, or merely the result of 
misunderstanding of the true facts on his part. Applicant subsequently denied intending 
to falsify his responses and explained that when he completed the e-QIP he was doing 
so from his memory and had not given serious thought to the questions. In addition, he 
thought a lot of the accounts that might have been listed actually fell outside the seven–
year window of the questions and that they had already been dropped from his credit 
report. He did identify one delinquent student loan. Applicant denied having “malicious 
intent” to falsify his responses. 
 
 I have considered Applicant’s background, professional career, including his 
military service, and his seemingly superficial understanding of financial matters, in 
analyzing his actions. His confusion and resultant actions are understandable and his 
position is reasonable. As it pertains to the alleged deliberate falsifications, Applicant’s 
credible explanation has refuted AG ¶ 16(a).82 In this instance, I conclude that 
Applicant’s actions do not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.  
Whole-Person Concept 
                                                          
82
 The Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving 
falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant’s 
intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record 
evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the 
applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  
 
ISCR Case No. 03-10390 at 8 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). 
 
 
 
14 
                                      
 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He allowed 
several accounts to become delinquent, placed for collection or charged off, and had 
one delinquent account go to judgment against him. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial than 
the disqualifying evidence. Well before the SOR was issued, Applicant resolved some of 
his delinquent accounts and then, with the assistance of a credit repair firm, started 
addressing the remaining accounts. While it is well-settled that adverse information from 
a credit report can normally meet the substantial evidence standard and the 
government’s obligations under Directive ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations, and the 
burden shifts to an applicant to establish either that he or she is not responsible for the 
debts in question, or that matters in mitigation apply,83 in this instance, Applicant has 
successfully disputed some of the adverse listings appearing in his credit reports that 
also appear as allegations in the SOR. There are clear indications that Applicant’s 
financial problems are under control.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:84 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
                                                          
83

resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Nevertheless, this decision should serve as a warning that his failure 
to continue his debt-resolution efforts or the actual accrual of new delinquent debts will 
adversely affect his future eligibility for a security clearance.85 Overall, the record 
evidence leaves me without substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility 
and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations and personal 
conduct. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   For APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant

85
 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant, the decision, including the warning, should not 
be interpreted as being contingent on future monitoring of Applicant’s financial condition. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach conditions to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 
2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd.

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
