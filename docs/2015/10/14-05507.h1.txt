HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges two mortgage debts totaling 
$246,290, and both debts were secured by the same residence in state A. Applicant 
was unable to afford the payments on the property because of a circumstance beyond 
his control, and the property went into foreclosure. The creditor provided an Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1099-A indicating the first mortgage debt for $211,308 
was resolved. The creditor for the second mortgage debt provided an IRS Form 1099-C 
discharging or cancelling the remainder owed of $26,691. Aside from these two debts, 
Applicant has an excellent track record of paying his debts. He provided sufficient 
evidence of his financial responsibility. Financial considerations concerns are mitigated. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 16, 2013, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security clearance application (SF 86). 
(GE 1) On May 20, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006.  
   
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(HE 2) The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to find that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s access to classified 
information and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether 
Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2)  
 
On June 16, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing. (HE 3) On July 27, 2015, Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On 
July 30, 2015, the case was assigned to me. On August 7, 2015, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a hearing notice setting the hearing for 
September 15, 2015. The hearing was held as scheduled. Department Counsel offered 
three exhibits into evidence, and Applicant offered 13 exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 14-20; 
Government Exhibit (GE) 1-3; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-M) All exhibits were admitted 
into evidence without objection. (Tr. 15, 20) On September 23, 2015, DOHA received 
the transcript of the hearing. On October 14, 2015, three post-hearing documents were 
received, which were admitted without objection. (AE N-P) On October 14, 2015, the 
record closed.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. He 
also provided extenuating and mitigating information as part of his SOR response. 
Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 37-year-old computer engineer, who has worked for the same 
employer for eight years. (Tr. 6-7; GE 1) In 1997, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 6) 
In 2002, he received a bachelor of science degree with a major in computer science and 
engineering. (Tr. 6, 48) He has started classes for a master’s degree in computer 
forensics. (Tr. 7) He has never served in the military (Tr. 6) In 2005, he married, and he 
has three children, who are ages one, four, and six. (Tr. 52, 57; GE 1) There is no 
evidence of security violations, disciplinary problems with his employer, illegal drug use, 
criminal offenses, or alcohol abuse.  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
After graduating from college, he accepted employment from another 
government agency at an annual salary of $45,000. (Tr. 48) When Applicant returned 
from overseas in late 2007, his annual government salary was about $70,000. (Tr. 56) 
In late 2007, Applicant obtained employment from a government contractor at an annual 
salary of $115,000. (Tr. 56)  
 
                                            
1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his SF 86, credit reports, 
SOR response, hearing transcript, and exhibits. The record establishes two mortgage 
debts totaling $246,290 from the same residence in state A, which became delinquent 
in late 2009 or early 2010. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b)  
 
In 2004, Applicant purchased a residence in state A, where he intended to 
establish his residence. (Tr. 50) He did not intend to immediately occupy the residence 
because he planned to be deployed overseas working for another government 
department for most of his career. (Tr. 32) He hoped to return to state A in between 
overseas assignments, or at least after his first overseas assignment. (Tr. 50, 52) In 
2004, he made a down payment and provided a deposit for a home to be built. (Tr. 32-
33) The home was financed with a 10 percent down payment, a 10 percent second 
mortgage, and an 80 percent first mortgage. (Tr. 41) He believed the residence in state 
A was a good investment, and it would be prudent to get into the housing market before 
prices became even higher. (Tr. 50-52)  
 
Applicant was assigned overseas in January 2005, and he returned to the United 
States at the end of 2007. (Tr. 53) The house in state A was completed in 2006. (Tr. 33-
34, 49) He did not have a precise understanding of the housing market and prices in 
state A while he was deployed overseas. (Tr. 54-55) In 2006, he listed the property with 
a real estate agent, and he tried to sell it. (Tr. 35) He had a contract; however, the 
contract fell through. In 2006, home prices began to fall in state A. (Tr. 35) In 2008, he 
again listed the home in state A for sale, and in 2009, Applicant listed the home for a 
short sale. (Tr. 37, 60; AE F) The monthly payment on his home in state A, including 
both mortgages, taxes, insurance, and home owners’ association fees, was about 
$3,088. (Tr. 63-64; AE O at 3) The house was vacant and not being rented. 
 
In 2007, Applicant purchased a town house in state B for $535,000. (Tr. 35; AE O 
at 3) In 2007, Applicant and his spouse were both employed, and they had sufficient 
income to pay the mortgages on the properties in states A and B. (Tr. 36) In 2008, 
home prices in state B began to decline, and Applicant was underwater on both homes. 
(Tr. 36) In 2008, the fair market value of his town house in state B declined by about 
$100,000 below his purchase price. (AE O at 3)        
 
In 2010, Applicant and his spouse learned their infant daughter had medical 
issues, which required significant care, including physical therapy. (Tr. 37, 61-62; AE D; 
AE E) Continued daycare was not possible. (Tr. 61-62; AE D; AE E) Applicant’s spouse 
quit her employment in September 2010 so that she could care for their daughter. (Tr. 
37) The family income declined from about $200,000 to about $115,000. (Tr. 38)  
 
Applicant consulted counsel and an accountant, and he elected to stop making 
payments on the mortgages on the residence in state A, which became delinquent in 
early 2010. (Tr. 38, 41, 60; AE O at 2) He continued to hope for a short sale; however, 
no such sale occurred. The statute of limitations bars a deficiency judgment for the first 
and second mortgages. (Tr. 39, 41)

The creditor for the first mortgage account in SOR ¶ 1.a provided Applicant an 
IRS Form 1099-A indicating the debt for $211,308 was resolved. The lender acquired 
the property in September 2010 for $77,200 at a public sale, and the fair market value 
of the property equaled the amount of the debt. (AE H; AE O at 16) In 2013, the creditor 
for the second mortgage account in SOR ¶ 1.b provided Applicant an IRS Form 1099-C 
discharging or cancelling the remainder owed to the creditor of $26,691. (AE O at 12) 
When Applicant filed his taxes for 2013, he included $26,691 as income on line 13 of his 
IRS Form 1040, and he paid taxes for the “gain” he received from being released from 
responsibility to repay the second mortgage on his home in state A. (Tr. 41; AE O at 10) 
 
Applicant’s W2 for 2010 showed wages of $128,000, and Medicare wages of 
$144,900. (AE O at 13) Applicant and his spouse’s adjusted gross income for 2010 on 
the IRS Form 1040 was $182,628. (AE O at 14) Applicant and his spouse’s monthly 
expenses in 2010, including principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI) on both 
houses and two vehicle payments, was $9,400. (AE O at 7) He did not include his 
federal and state income taxes or other withholding as expenses, and he did not provide 
his net income after withholding taxes, medical insurance, etc. (AE O at 7, 15) His 2010 
federal income tax return shows federal income taxes paid of $22,637. Applicant’s 
spouse stopped working outside their home in September 2010, and the reduction in 
family income is not fully reflected in their 2010 federal tax return. (AE O at 1) His 2011 
and 2012 federal income tax returns were not requested or provided.  
 
Applicant’s wages for 2013 were $146,000. (AE O at 10) His adjusted gross 
income, after including the amount from his IRS Form 1099-C and deducting his IRA 
contribution, was $169,543. (AE O at 10) 
 
Aside from the two SOR debts, Applicant’s 2014 and 2015 credit reports show he 
has an excellent track record of paying his debts. (AE 2, AE 3) He has more than 
$400,000 in his and his spouse’s retirement accounts. (Tr. 42, 57; AE J-K) He tries to 
save 15-20 percent of his income each month, which amounts to about $24,000 
annually. (Tr. 42, 57-58) He also invests a total of $500 monthly in his children’s 
education accounts. (Tr. 58-59) His current annual income is $165,000. (Tr. 57) In 2010, 
his PITI was $3,800 for his residence in state B. (Tr. 68; AE O at 6) Applicant was able 
to refinance the loan and obtain a lower interest rate, and his PITI for his residence in 
state B is currently $2,900. (Tr. 57) 
    
Character Evidence  
 
A special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been employed 
at the FBI for 12 years. (Tr. 26) He has known Applicant socially and professionally for 
about five years. (Tr. 24, 26) He described Applicant as honorable, honest, responsible, 
trustworthy, and conscientious about following the rules. (Tr. 24-25) Applicant has 
excellent judgment. (Tr. 25) He would loan money to Applicant or cosign on a loan for 
Applicant if asked to do so. (Tr. 25)

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865. 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this 
decision on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security

clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.”  
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his SF 86, credit reports, 
SOR response, hearing transcript, and exhibits. The record establishes two delinquent 
mortgage debts totaling $246,290 secured by the same residence in state A. The 
residence went into foreclosure in 2010. The Government established the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible 
applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts warrants application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
through 20(c). Applicant’s daughter had medical problems, and it was necessary for his 
spouse to end her employment outside their home so she could care for their daughter. 
This is a circumstance largely beyond his control, which harmed his finances.    
 
In 2004-2005, Applicant decided to purchase property in state A. This decision 
was reasonable. Millions of American purchased property to get an investment in a 
rapidly rising market, and then lost money when the real estate bubble burst and prices 
precipitously declined. His equity and down payment were lost, and the property was 
underwater. In 2010, Applicant’s residence in state A was costing Applicant and his 
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

spouse $36,000 a year, and the fair market value was substantially less than the two 
mortgages on it. He unsuccessfully attempted to sell his residence. Applicant and his 
spouse decided that caring for their daughter was more important than the income she 
earned, and she should end her employment. This change caused their finances to 
become precarious and any adverse financial occurrence, such as Applicant or his 
spouse’s illness, would cause a financial crisis and delinquent debt. It was reasonable 
and prudent for Applicant to “stop the bleeding” and permit an expedited foreclosure 
process. This enabled the first mortgage holder to quickly foreclose, and in turn, the first 
mortgage holder released Applicant from liability, as documented on his IRS Form 
1099-A by indicating the amount owed equaled the fair market value of the property.  
 
The second mortgage debt in SOR ¶ 1.b for $26,691 is more problematic. 
Applicant had the financial resources between 2010 and 2013 to settle or resume 
payments on the second mortgage. Failure to abide by one’s contractual responsibilities 
and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control and lack of judgment. 
Paying one’s lawful debts has priority over putting money into retirement accounts or 
education accounts. His failure to settle this debt or make payments shows lack of 
judgment. Notwithstanding, this debt became delinquent more than five years ago. In 
2013, the second mortgage creditor released Applicant from liability, and elected not to 
seek a deficiency. I am confident that if the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.b had actively and timely 
sought repayment, Applicant would have made payments or settled this debt. Applicant 
has paid taxes on the savings he accrued by not paying this debt, and once he received 
an IRS Form 1099-C in 2013, the account was closed, and the debt was resolved. 
  
  Applicant’s delinquent debts “occurred under such circumstances that [are] 
unlikely to recur and [do] not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment.” He has learned from his mistakes. He acted responsibly under the 
circumstances by maintaining contact with all of his creditors,3 except for the creditor in 
SOR ¶ 1.b. He made required payments on numerous debts, and he maintained all of 
his debts in a current status from 2013 to the present. There are clear indications that 
the problem is resolved and his finances are under control. His track record of financial 
responsibility shows sufficient effort, good judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability to 
warrant mitigation of financial considerations security concerns. Even if financial 
considerations are not mitigated under AG ¶¶ 20(a) through 20(c), they are mitigated 
under the whole-person concept, infra.    
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
                                            
3“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 37-year-old computer engineer, who has worked for the same 
employer for eight years. In 2002, he received a bachelor of science degree with a 
major in computer science and engineering. He has started classes for a master’s 
degree in computer forensics. An FBI special agent described Applicant as honorable, 
honest, responsible, trustworthy, and conscientious about following the rules, and the 
FBI special agent would loan money to Applicant or cosign on a loan for Applicant if 
asked to do so. There is no evidence of security violations, disciplinary problems with 
his employer, illegal drug use, criminal offenses, or alcohol abuse.  
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his SF 86, credit reports, 
SOR response, hearing transcript, and exhibits. The record establishes two mortgage 
debts totaling $246,290 secured by the same residence in state A became delinquent. 
In 2010, Applicant was unable to afford the payments on the property due to 
circumstances beyond his control, and the property was foreclosed in September 2010. 
In 2010, the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.a provided an IRS Form 1099-A indicating the first 
mortgage debt for $211,308 was resolved. In 2013, the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.b provided 
an IRS Form 1099-C discharging or cancelling the remainder owed of $26,691. He 
provided sufficient evidence of his financial responsibility. There are clear indications 
that his financial problems will not recur, are being resolved, and are under control. 
 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence 
of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant 
is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge

can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted).  
 
Applicant understands what he needs to do to maintain his financial 
responsibility. All of his debts are paid or being paid. His efforts at debt resolution have 
established a “meaningful track record” of debt repayment. He should continue to check 
his credit report and diligently act to resolve any negative entries that arise on his credit 
report. I am confident he will maintain his financial responsibility. 
    
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations concerns are mitigated, and eligibility for access to 
classified information is granted.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
