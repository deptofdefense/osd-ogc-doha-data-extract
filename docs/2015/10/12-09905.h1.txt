HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 12 delinquent, collection, or 
charged-off accounts totaling $25,809. Three old medical debts and two other debts 
could not be located, and they were dropped from her credit report. She paid or settled 
three debts. Her remaining four SOR debts are in established payment plans. In 2015, 
she paid more than $3,000 to address her SOR debts and to correct her credit report. 
Her September 28, 2015 credit report shows she has paid, is paying, has resolved, or 
kept current 14 debts. She provided sufficient evidence of her progress in resolving her 
financial problems. Financial considerations concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 4, 2012, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security clearance application (SF 86). 
(GE 1) On January 22, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 
(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 
20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(HE 2) The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to find that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s access to classified 
information and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether 
Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2)  
 
On March 18, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested 
a hearing. (HE 3) On June 27, 2015, Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On 
July 23, 2015, the case was assigned to me. On August 10, 2015, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a hearing notice setting the hearing for 
September 1, 2015. Department Counsel offered three exhibits into evidence, and 
Applicant offered 10 exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 15-20; Government Exhibit (GE) 1-3; 
Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-J) All exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. 
(Tr. 16, 20-22) On September 10, 2015, DOHA received the transcript of the hearing. 
On September 30, 2015, 33 post-hearing documents were received, which were 
admitted on October 1, 2015, without objection. (AE K-AE AR) On October 1, 2015, the 
record closed.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 
1.i, and 1.k. She also provided extenuating and mitigating information as part of her 
SOR response. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 49-year-old executive assistant. (Tr. 5-6; GE 1) She provides 
administrative support for a government office. (Tr. 6) She has supported the same 
government office since 1998. (Tr. 7) From 1995 to 1999, she served in the Air Force, 
and she left active duty as a senior airman (E-4). (Tr. 6) Her Air Force specialties were 
aircraft environmental systems mechanic and computer operations. (Tr. 6) She earned 
an associate’s degree in chemical engineering technology, and in 2005, she received a 
bachelor’s of science degree in information technology. (Tr. 7-8) In 1991, she married, 
and in 1993, she divorced. (Tr. 17) She has two sons. (Tr. 44) She has held a security 
clearance since the mid-1990s, and there is no evidence of security violations. (Tr. 23) 
There is no evidence of disciplinary problems with her employer, illegal drug use, 
criminal offenses, or alcohol abuse.  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her SF 86, credit reports, 
SOR response, and hearing transcript. She disclosed a wage garnishment and 
delinquent utility debt in her SF 86. The status of Applicant’s 12 delinquent, collection, 
or charged-off debts totaling $25,809 is detailed in the following paragraphs.    
 
                                            
1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a charged-off second mortgage account for $8,747 and SOR 
¶ 1.d alleges a delinquent debt credit card debt for $1,686. They are both owed to the 
same creditor. (AE L) Applicant acknowledged responsibility for both debts. (Tr. 25) She 
entered into a settlement agreement with the collection company, and she made two 
payments of $150 each to the creditor, one in August 2015 and one in September 2015. 
(Tr. 25) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a delinquent debt for $6,258, resulting from a vehicle 
repossessed in September 2014. (Tr. 27) Applicant cosigned on a loan so that her son, 
who had recently received a disability retirement from the Army, could have a vehicle. 
(Tr. 28) Her son was supposed to make the car and insurance payments. (Tr. 28) The 
car was damaged, and then the car seller repossessed it. (Tr. 28) On May 22, 2015, 
she established a payment plan with the creditor’s attorney to address a debt for 
$7,998, and she provided proof that she paid the creditor $300 almost every month 
since May 2015. (Tr. 29; AE L; AE P; AE R) She paid the creditor $1,200 from May 
through September 2015. (AE L; AE P; AE R)         
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a charged-off debt for $2,717 owed to a home repair store. 
Applicant received an offer to settle the account for 30 percent of the amount owed. (Tr. 
30) She accepted the offer, and she has paid a total of $150. (Tr. 31, 54; AE S) She is 
required in her settlement agreement to pay $50 monthly. (Tr. 31)   
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.j allege two collection accounts for $1,392 and $226 owed to 
the same telecommunications company. Applicant initially cancelled service for a 
landline, resulting in the $226 debt. (Tr. 36) In 2013, she cancelled service with the 
company. (Tr. 32, 35-36) SOR ¶ 1.i alleges a collection account for $256 with the 
original creditor being the telecommunications company. (AE O) The creditor is a 
collection agent. (SOR response; AE O) On August 13, 2015, she settled the debt for 
$415. (Tr. 33, 36-37, 54-55) On August 16, 2015, the collection agent wrote that the 
account was settled and had a zero balance. (AE O)   
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, and 1.k allege three delinquent medical debts for $774, $509, 
and $74. Applicant believed her medical insurance company was responsible for paying 
these three debts. (SOR response; AE L) These debts were incurred about 10 years 
ago. (Tr. 34) When she checked with the creditors, they were unable to locate the 
accounts. (Tr. 34) These three medical debts do not appear on her September 28, 2015 
credit report. (AE V) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges a charged-off debt for $339 resulting from a store account. 
Applicant said she made two payments around 2008, and Applicant was unable to 
make additional payments. (SOR response) She contacted the creditor, and the creditor 
was unable to locate the new creditor currently holding the account. (Tr. 35) This debt 
does not appear on her September 28, 2015 credit report. (AE V) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.l alleges a collection account for $2,831. Applicant was unsure of the 
origin of this debt. (Tr. 38-39) At the time of her hearing, she was trying to locate the 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
creditor currently holding the account. (Tr. 37-39) This debt does not appear on her 
September 28, 2015 credit report. (AE V) 
 
Applicant provided her September 28, 2015 summary from three major credit 
report companies. (AE V) Her credit scores are fair, fair, and good. (AE V at 2) Fourteen 
current or paid accounts are shown. (AE V at 5-10) There are some negative financial 
entries for her paid charged-off accounts, her transferred charged-off accounts with zero 
balances, and her vehicle repossession account in repayment status in SOR ¶ 1.b. (AE 
V at 9, 11-14) The debts in SOR ¶ 1.a for $8,747 and ¶ 1.d for $1,686 are shown as 
transferred to recovery. (AE V at 14-15) 
 
Applicant has received credit counseling, and she has been working with a credit 
restoration or repair company to challenge derogatory entries and to improve the 
content of her credit reports. (Tr. 17-18; SOR response; AE A) She made four payments 
totaling $1,000 to the credit restoration company in 2015. (Tr. 52-53; AE A) She 
developed a budget. (SOR response) Her monthly income is about $4,500, and she has 
a monthly remainder of about $1,000, which is available for unforeseen expenses such 
as repairs, replacements, and emergencies. (Tr. 22, 39-40, 45; SOR response) In the 
past several months, she paid to repair or replace her vehicle, water heater, refrigerator, 
and washer. (Tr. 44-45) She has a minimal balance in her bank accounts, and she has 
no retirement account. (Tr. 42) Her vehicle is paid off, and her $138,000 mortgage is 
current. (Tr. 42-43; AE T) She does not use any credit cards. (Tr. 47)  
 
Applicant obtained two “car title loans” totaling about $5,000, which she used to 
bring her mortgage to current status. (Tr. 48, 51-52) She understands that utilization of 
payday loans and car title loans shows poor judgment, as they charge very high interest 
rates. (Tr. 48-52) Her car title loans were paid off in May 2015. (AE N) In February 
2015, she began paying $148 monthly to address her student loans, which had been 
deferred. (Tr. 52; AE M) She provided proof that her student loan payments are being 
made, and her student loan account is current. (AE M)   
 
In 2012, Applicant’s son was medically retired from the Army with 40 percent 
disability. (Tr. 56) He suffered from a bladder problem, post-traumatic stress disorder, 
and bi-polar disorder. (SOR response; Tr. 56) After his release from a mental hospital, 
he moved in with Applicant. (SOR response) At first he did well, and then he stopped 
taking his medication. (Tr. 57) He stole her debit card and made charges on it. (Tr. 58; 
SOR response) He became violent; she called the police; and he was removed from her 
home and placed into a mental institution. (Tr. 57) She cancelled the debit card, and 
after he was released from the mental institution, she did not permit him to return to her 
home. (Tr. 58) 
   
Character Evidence  
 
Applicant provided nine character statements from friends, coworkers, 
supervisors, and DOD employees. (AE B-J) The statements laud her dedicated service 
to the DOD since 1998 and emphasize her diligence, professionalism, efforts at 
financial improvement, conscientious compliance with rules, dependability, loyalty, 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
honesty, trustworthiness, and contributions to mission accomplishment. (AE B-J) A 
DOD senior executive service (SES) described the importance to the national defense 
of his office and Applicant’s efforts to resolve her financial problems. (AE I) He 
described her character and work product as follows: 
 
I have known [Applicant] professionally since she joined [his organization 
as a contractor] in July 1998. . . . [and Applicant became his] Executive 
Assistant and Security Manager [around August 2001. Applicant] is an 
exceptional employee and her performance is outstanding. I rely on 
[Applicant] to manage multiple tasks for me for our [senior military officers 
and DOD civilian employees. She] is one of a handful of people key to 
accomplishing our mission. [She] is meticulous at protecting classified 
information. (AE I) 
             
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865. 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this 
decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance.

Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
Id. (internal citation omitted).  
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her SF 86, credit reports, 
SOR response, and hearing transcript. Applicant’s SOR alleges and the record 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
establishes 12 delinquent, collection, or charged-off accounts totaling $25,809. The 
Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring 
additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving her debts warrants application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
through 20(c). Applicant’s son had mental problems after leaving the Army, and 
Applicant tried to provide financial support for him. This is a circumstance largely 
beyond her control, which harmed her finances.    
 
Of the 12 delinquent, collection, or charged-off SOR accounts totaling $25,809, 
three old medical debts and two other debts could not be located or substantiated, and 
they were dropped from her credit report. She paid or settled three debts. Her remaining 
four SOR debts are in established payment plans. In 2015, she paid more than $3,000 
to address her credit issues, which includes $2,000 paid to her SOR creditors and 
$1,000 paid to a credit correction or repair company. Her September 28, 2015 credit 
report shows she has paid, is paying, has resolved, or kept current 14 debts, including 
her mortgage and student loans. 
  
  The Appeal Board explained that having unpaid, currently delinquent debt is not 
necessarily a bar to having access to classified information stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for 
repayment, accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which 
evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009).  
 
  Applicant’s delinquent debts “occurred under such circumstances that [are] 
unlikely to recur and [do] not cast doubt on the [her] current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment.” She acted responsibly under the circumstances by maintaining 
contact with her creditors,3 making payments and bringing her debts to current status. 
                                            
3“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012

She received financial counseling, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control. Her mortgage, student loans, and several other 
ongoing expenses are current. Her track record of financial responsibility shows 
sufficient effort, good judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability to warrant mitigation of 
financial considerations security concerns. Even if financial considerations are not 
mitigated under AG ¶¶ 20(a) through 20(c), they are mitigated under the whole-person 
concept, infra.    
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 49-year-old executive assistant, who provides administrative 
support for a DOD office. She has supported the same government office since 1998.  
From 1995 to 1999, she served in the Air Force, and she left active duty as a senior 
airman. She earned an associate’s degree in chemical engineering technology, and in 
2005, she received a bachelor’s of science degree in information technology. Nine 
character statements from friends, coworkers, and supervisors, including a DOD SES, 
lauded her dedicated service to the DOD since 1998 and emphasized her diligence, 
professionalism, efforts at financial improvement, conscientious compliance with rules, 
dependability, loyalty, honesty, trustworthiness, and contributions to accomplishment of 
her employer’s mission. She held a security clearance since the mid-1990s, and there is 
no evidence of security violations, disciplinary problems with her employer, illegal drug 
use, criminal offenses, or alcohol abuse.  
 
                                                                                                                                            
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

Applicant’s SOR alleges 12 delinquent, collection, or charged-off accounts 
totaling $25,809. Three old medical debts and two other debts could not be located, and 
they were dropped from her credit report. She paid or settled three debts, and her 
remaining four SOR debts are in established payment plans. Her September 28, 2015 
credit report shows she has paid, is paying, has resolved, or kept current 14 debts. 
Applicant has stable employment. She received financial counseling, has a budget, and 
has a monthly remainder after expenses of about $1,000. There are clear indications 
that her financial problems will not recur, are being resolved, and are under control. 
 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence 
of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant 
is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted).  
 
Applicant understands what she needs to do to establish and maintain her 
financial responsibility. All of her debts are paid or being paid. Her efforts at debt 
resolution have established a “meaningful track record” of debt re-payment. She should 
continue to check her credit report and diligently act to resolve any negative entries that 
arise on her credit report. I am confident she will maintain her financial responsibility.4    
                                            
4The Government has the option of following-up with more questions about Applicant’s finances. 
The Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit reports, 
investigation, and interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the Government from 
subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the security 
significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative security 
significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). Violation of a promise made in a 
security context to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may 
support future revocation of a security clearance. An administrative judge does not have “authority to 
grant an interim, conditional, or probationary clearance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 
2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 04-03907

I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations concerns are mitigated, and eligibility for access to 
classified information is granted.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.l:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
