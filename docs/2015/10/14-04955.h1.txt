Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny her a security
clearance to work in the defense industry. She has a history of financial problems or
difficulties consisting of more than $27,000 in collection or charged-off accounts, which
are ongoing and unresolved. She did not present sufficient evidence to rebut,
extenuate, mitigate, or explain her problematic financial history. Accordingly, this case is
decided against Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on March 18, 2014.  After reviewing the application and1
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

(DOD),  on February 7, 2015, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining2
it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her
eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint. It3
detailed the reasons for the action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for
financial considerations. Applicant answered the SOR in a March 8, 2015 four-page
memorandum. 
The case was assigned to me on May 1, 2015. The hearing was held as
scheduled on June 2, 2015. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1–5, and they were
admitted. Applicant did not offer any documentary exhibits, and she did not call any
witnesses other than herself. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on June 9, 2015.
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 33-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security clearance
for the first time. She is employed as a part-time, on-call engineer technician for a
federal contractor. She has worked for the same company since 2010, although never
in a full-time capacity. Her security clearance application shows she was unemployed
during 2009–2010, during 2008–2009, and in 2008. It also reflects multiple residences
(15) from 2004 to present.  
Applicant’s first marriage ended in divorce, and she married her current husband
in 2008. She has three sons, all of whom are residing in her household. She also has
two stepdaughters, one adult and one teenager, from her husband’s previous marriage. 
Applicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties, which she does not
dispute. The SOR allegations consist of 18 collection or charged-off accounts ranging in
amounts from a low of $25 to a high of $18,602 for a total of about $27,539. In her
answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the delinquent accounts except for five
accounts, four of which she disputed and one in which she stated she was an
authorized user but not the account holder. Her problematic financial history is
documented and established by credit reports from 2015 and 2014.  At the hearing, she4
admitted that the accounts remained unpaid and that nothing had changed since she

submitted her answer to the SOR.  Likewise, she did not provide any documentation5
showing that the delinquent accounts are paid, settled, in repayment, forgiven,
cancelled, in dispute, or otherwise resolved. The last time she had contact with any of
the creditors was in the 2010–2011 period, after she began her current employment.6
Applicant attributed her problematic financial history to several circumstances.
First, she pointed to her history of unemployment during 2008–2010 noted above, her
underemployment as a part-time, on-call employee since 2010 that made her income
unpredictable, and her husband’s unemployment since about November 2014.  Second,7
she and her husband have been involved in a long-standing custody dispute to obtain
custody of her youngest stepdaughter, which resulted in approximately $4,000 in
attorney’s fees and costs.  Third, she is owed approximately $23,000 in child support8
from the father of her oldest son.9
Applicant stated that she and her husband have no money in the bank, and she
described their current financial situation as “just getting by.”  She further stated that10
her plan to resolve the delinquent accounts consists of making payment arrangements,
starting with the smallest debt and then moving on to the next debt.11
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As12
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt13
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.

4
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An14
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  15
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting16
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An17
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate18
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme19
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.20
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.21
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it22
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.

Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant23
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 24
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  25
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly compromise
classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It encompasses
concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important qualities. A
person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or
negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. Taken together, the evidence indicates inability or unwillingness
to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning26 27
of Guideline F. 
 In mitigation, I have considered six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and28
I have especially considered the following as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or death, divorce, or
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances.

 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (citations and quotations omitted). 30

Applicant’s problematic financial history is likely related to her uneven
employment history, her husband’s unemployment, the costs incurred for the custody
dispute, and the lack of child-support payments for her oldest son. Nevertheless, the
available evidence does not show that Applicant has acted responsibly under the
circumstances. She has done little, if anything, to address the delinquent accounts in
the SOR. Likewise, she has provided no documentation showing progress in addressing
those matters. At this point, the delinquent debts in the SOR are considered to be
wholly unresolved.  
Of course, the purpose of this case is not aimed at collecting debts.  Rather, the29
purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness
consistent with the guidelines in the Directive. In evaluating Guideline F cases, the
Appeal Board has established the following standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of a meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant
actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement
that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.30
Here, the evidence does not support a conclusion that Applicant has established a plan
and taken steps to implement that plan sufficient to mitigate the concern. In other words,
there is no track record of progress showing a favorable upward trend. Instead, the
available evidence shows that Applicant’s problematic financial history is ongoing with
no sign of abatement.    
Given those circumstances, Applicant’s history of financial problems creates
doubt about her reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect
classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole
and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice

versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I31
conclude that she did not meet her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified
information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.r: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified
information is denied.
