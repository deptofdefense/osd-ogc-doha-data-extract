Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny her eligibility for a
public trust position. She has a history of financial problems or difficulties. Although she
did not present a perfect case in mitigation, she presented sufficient evidence to explain
and mitigate her problematic financial history. Accordingly, this case is decided for
Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on February 28, 2013.  After reviewing the application and1
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense
(DOD) sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), dated October 28, 2014, detailing
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
 The AG were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG3

a trustworthiness concern under Guideline F for financial considerations.  The action2
was taken under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel
Security Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of
Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Jan. 1987), as amended
(Regulation); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG)  implemented by the DOD on3
September 1, 2006. The SOR recommended submission of Applicant’s case to an
administrative judge to determine her eligibility to occupy an automated data processing
(ADP) position to support a contract with the DOD.  
Applicant answered the SOR on or about November 20, 2014. Her responses to
the various allegations were mixed, and she requested a hearing.  
The case was assigned to me on May 1, 2015. The hearing was held as
scheduled on June 3, 2015. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1–5, and they were
admitted. Applicant offered Exhibits A–G, and they were admitted. She did not call any
witnesses other than herself. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on June 11,
2015.
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 54-year-old full-time employee of a health care contractor for the
Defense Department. She has been employed with her current employer since
February 2013. She is seeking to obtain eligibility to occupy a position of public trust for
her current job responsibilities. Eligibility is necessary because her job involves access
to sensitive but unclassified information known as personally identifiable information
(PII). 
Applicant’s recent employment history includes a period of unemployment from
June 2012 to February 2013.  She has otherwise been continuously employed since4
2003. Her employment history also includes active duty military service during
1982–1987. During 2009–2013, Applicant lived in a residence for military veterans who
are homeless, unemployed, or otherwise in need of assistance. This residence forms
the basis of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a discussed below. 
Applicant’s first two marriages ended in divorce. She married for the third time in
2008 and separated in 2009. Her current husband has not provided any financial
support or assistance during the separation. Applicant has one child, an adult son.

Applicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties. The SOR allegations
consist of 11 collection or charged-off accounts ranging in amounts from a low of $125
to a high of $4,796 for a total of about $16,658. Applicant has paid two accounts, and
another account is in repayment. The other eight accounts remain unresolved, although
Applicant intends to resolve them in the future. The three accounts that have been paid
or are in repayment are discussed below. 
The $4,796 collection account is SOR ¶ 1.a is in repayment via a garnishment of
Applicant’s wages at the rate of $289 every two weeks.  As of May 22, 2014, the5
balance due had been reduced from $6,096 to $2,909. In other words, Applicant had a
total of $3,187 withheld from her wages. The account is on track to be paid in full in
about ten more biweekly pay periods. Applicant explained that she agreed or consented
to the garnishment because she thought doing so was the best way to pay off the debt
in a timely manner. 
The deficiency balance of $2,189 in SOR ¶ 1.f, which stems from a vehicle
repossession, was paid in full in November 2014.  In July 2013, the creditor obtained a6
judgment against Applicant in the amount of $8,774. Applicant made biweekly payments
beginning in November 2013 and ending in November 2014, and she paid $6,832 in
principal, $1,331 in interest, and $170 in fees to satisfy the judgment. 
The $447 collection account was paid in October 2013.  This account stems from7
a civil traffic case in municipal court. 
In November 2014, Applicant obtained assistance from a nonprofit service
organization.  The plan called for her to make a monthly deposit of $1,000 to be used8
for repayment of eight accounts. She decided not to follow through with the plan
because she thought she could pay off the accounts faster with larger payment amounts
on her own.9
Applicant meets weekly with a counselor at work.  The weekly sessions address10
budgeting, banking, and how to deal with the stress associated with her financial
situation.

Applicant estimated having about $258 in a checking account and nothing in a
savings account.  Her gross income for 2014 was about $32,400.  Her plan to resolve11 12
the remaining delinquent accounts is to pay off one account at a time, working from the
highest amount to the lowest amount owed.  She will address the next remaining13
delinquent account once the garnishment action is concluded for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a. 
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant14
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 15
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect [sensitive] information.  16
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly compromise
sensitive information to obtain money or something else of value. It encompasses
concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important qualities. A
person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or
negligent in handling and safeguarding sensitive information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. Taken together, the evidence indicates inability or unwillingness
to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning17 18
of Guideline F. 
 AG ¶ 20(a)–(f).19

 In mitigation, I have considered six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and19
I have especially considered the following as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or death, divorce, or
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control; and
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
Applicant’s problematic financial history is related, in part, to her period of
unemployment during 2012–2013. She has acted responsibly under the circumstances
by obtaining new employment in 2013, and then engaging in debt repayment from 2013
to date. So far, approximately $11,767 has been paid toward the three debts discussed
above. Given her means, that is a substantial amount of money. Those repayment
efforts, some of which were done via a garnishment, show that Applicant is taking a
reasonable, responsible, and serious approach to resolving her delinquent debts.  
  
Of course, the purpose of this case is not aimed at collecting debts.  Rather, the20
purpose is to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness
consistent with the guidelines in the Directive. In evaluating Guideline F cases, the
Appeal Board has established the following standard:
The Board has previously noted that the concept of a meaningful track
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of
law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the
SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has
established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant
actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the
entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in evaluating
the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no requirement
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the
payments of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement

 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).22

that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan
be the ones listed in the SOR.21
Here, the evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has established a plan
and is taking steps to implement that plan sufficient to mitigate the concern. In other
words, there is a track record of progress as demonstrated by repayment of more than
$11,000 in debt. Although a good portion of the debt repayment was done by essentially
involuntary means (e.g., a garnishment), that does not mean Applicant receives no
credit in mitigation. After all, it was her labor that earned the wages that were subject to
the garnishment. Based on the totality of facts and circumstances, I am persuaded that
Applicant is doing the best she can under challenging conditions to resolve this problem.
To conclude, the evidence leaves me with no doubt or concern about Applicant’s
eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed
the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the
unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I gave due consideration to the whole-person
concept.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial22
considerations concern.
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.k: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the interests of
national security to grant Applicant eligibility for an ADP position. Eligibility for access to
sensitive information is granted.
