MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant struggled financially to support herself and her three children after she lost 
her job in 2004. She tried to save her home by filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2006 and 
again in 2007, but she could not make the payments. In the past two years, Applicant has 
rehabilitated her $31,556 in student loans and satisfied a 2006 state income tax lien for 
$1,856. She filed her 2012 federal income tax return late but has no other record of tax filing 
delinquency. Applicant plans to resolve the $1,801 balance remaining on a past-due utility 
account. She disputes her liability for three other debts. The financial considerations 
concerns have been sufficiently mitigated. Position of trust granted. 
 
 Statement of the Case  
 
On December 5, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR),
1
 detailing the 
trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, as to why it could 
                                                 
1 
The SOR was issued to Applicant under her previous name, which is noted in parentheses in the caption. 
Applicant married in November 2012, but she did not legally change her last name until September 2014, after 
her formal wedding ceremony in July 2014. (GEs 1, 3; Tr. 28.)

not grant her eligibility for a public trust position. The DOD CAF acted under DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program 
(January 1987) as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD 
on September 1, 2006. 
  
Applicant answered the SOR allegations on December 20, 2014, and she requested 
a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. 
On April 21, 2015, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public 
trust position. On April 30, 2015, I scheduled a hearing for May 27, 2015. 
 
At the hearing, four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) were admitted into evidence 
without objection. A chart, prepared by Department Counsel as a supplement to his oral 
closing argument, was accepted into the record as a hearing exhibit (HE 1). Applicant 
submitted 14 exhibits (AEs A-N), which were received into the record with no objections. 
Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on June 3, 2015. 
 
At Applicant’s request, I held the record open for two weeks initially for her to submit 
additional documents. On June 5, 2015, Applicant timely submitted a secure email 
message, which could not be accessed due to conflicting encryption requirements. On 
June 16, 2015, she submitted by email eight exhibits (AEs O-V). The Government filed no 
objections by the June 26, 2015 deadline for comment, and the exhibits were accepted into 
evidence. 
 
Summary of SOR Allegations 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcies in 
August 2006 (SOR 1.a) and January 2007 (SOR 1.b), which were dismissed. Additionally, 
as of December 5, 2014, Applicant allegedly owed a state tax lien of $1,856 from 2006 
(SOR 1.c, duplicated in SOR 1.j); delinquent federal student loans of $21,007 (SOR 1.d) 
and $12,460 (SOR 1.e); $1,851 in past-due electric utility debt (SOR 1.f); $621 (SOR 1.g) 
and $293 (SOR 1.h) in natural gas debt in collection; a $60 telecommunications debt in 
collection (SOR 1.1); and a $3,617.51 deficiency balance for a timeshare resort that went 
into foreclosure in July 2011 (SOR 1.k). Finally, Applicant is alleged to have failed to file 
her 2012 federal income tax return (SOR 1.l). 
 
When Applicant responded to the SOR, she admitted the bankruptcy filings. She 
explained that she filed initially in August 2006 in an attempt to save her home after she 
became unemployed. She filed the second bankruptcy to secure more time to sell her 
home. Applicant admitted the state tax lien in SOR 1.c, but added that it was duplicated in 
SOR 1.j. As for her student loans, Applicant had them consolidated and had been making 
the payments to rehabilitate her loan to current status. Applicant acknowledged that she 
had owed the debts in SOR 1.f, and 1.i, but she was making payments on SOR 1.f and had 
satisfied the debt in SOR 1.i. Applicant disputed the validity of the gas utility debts in SOR 
 
 3 
1.g and 1.h and the timeshare debt in SOR 1.k. She denied SOR 1.l because she had filed 
her 2012 income tax return in February 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
  
  Before the introduction of any evidence, Department Counsel stipulated that SOR 
1.c and SOR 1.j were the same debt. In light of that fact, and after considering the 
pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact:  
  
Applicant is a 45-year-old college graduate who works as an “associate provider 
installation specialist” for a healthcare company with a TRICARE contract. (GE 1; AE C.) 
She loads information about healthcare providers onto an information technology system. 
(Tr. 66-67.) She was placed with the employer by a temporary staffing agency in 
September 2012 at an hourly wage of $16. She became a full-time permanent employee in 
October 2013. Applicant’s hourly wage is currently $19.66. (GE 1; Tr. 36-39.) Her base 
annual earnings without overtime are “a little less than $40,000.” (Tr. 67.) 
 
Applicant was married to her first husband from May 1988 to November 2000. They 
had two sons, now ages 27 and 18, and a daughter, now age 25. Applicant and her current 
husband were legally married in November 2012. (GE 1; Tr. 27.) He has two grown 
daughters from a previous relationship. (GE 1; Tr. 28.) Applicant’s 18-year-old son still lives 
at home. (Tr. 29.) 
 
Applicant graduated from high school in 1988. She attended college while working 
full time as a supervisor for an energy services company, eventually earning her bachelor’s 
degree in 2003. (GE 1; Tr. 29-30.) Applicant paid for college in part with student loans. 
Between September 1995 and October 2001, she took on approximately $26,079 in 
student loan debt (SOR 1.d and 1.e). (GE 2.) Applicant averaged $1,250 in take-home pay 
every two weeks as of June 2004. (AE L.) 
 
In September 2000, Applicant went on vacation with her sister to a resort. They 
jointly purchased a timeshare, taking on a $4,828 loan (SOR 1.k). On her return from 
vacation, she called to invalidate the purchase. She testified that she called to cancel within 
the three days allotted under the contract. Applicant never used the timeshare or made a 
payment toward the loan. She denies that she was billed for the loan or notified about the 
foreclosure. She received some collection notices initially, but had not asked for 
confirmation of the cancellation in writing. She let her sister handle the timeshare issue. 
(Tr. 57-60.) It is unclear whether her sister sought to nullify the contract of sale. 
 
While Applicant was working for the energy services company, she miscalculated 
her federal income tax liability for tax year 2001. The state assessed a tax liability of 
$1,442.28 for 2001. (AE R; Tr. 45-46.) In January 2006, the state filed a $1,856 state tax 
lien against Applicant because she had not paid the debt (SOR 1.c, duplicated in SOR 1.j). 
In July 2007, the state filed a second tax lien of $606 for an undisclosed tax year, which 
she satisfied in November 2007. (GE 2.) 
 
 
 4 
In May 2004, Applicant purchased for $560,000 a four bedroom, 3,000 square foot 
home for herself and her three children. She took on a conventional 30-year mortgage loan 
for $476,000. (GE 2.) She qualified for the loan partially because she owned a rental 
property.
2
 (Tr. 42.) A few months later, in July 2004, Applicant lost her job with the energy 
company due to a corporate relocation. The new office was too far from her home and her 
position was eliminated in the move. (Tr. 31-32.) Applicant collected unemployment while 
studying for her real estate license examination. She was employed as a realtor from 
October 2004 until July 2007. (GEs 1, 3.) 
 
Applicant struggled to meet her mortgage payments on her income. Her ex-husband 
did not pay child support for their three children. She stopped paying her mortgage around 
September 2005, after she had exhausted her savings. (GE 2; Tr. 39.) The mortgage 
lender initiated foreclosure of her loan by March 2006. (AE K.) In an effort to keep her 
home, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in August 2006 (SOR 1.a) listing 
approximately $500,000 in debt. (GE 1; Tr. 40, 92.) She made one payment of $2,800 into 
the bankruptcy, which was paid to her mortgage lender. The bankruptcy was dismissed in 
October 2006 for nonpayment. (GE 2; AE J; Tr. 41.) 
 
Applicant refiled a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in January 2007 (SOR 1.b) for time to sell 
her home. (GEs 2, 3; Tr. 42-43.) In March 2007, Applicant began working in the healthcare 
industry as a customer service representative for a healthcare claims processing company. 
(GE 1.) Her bankruptcy was dismissed in April 2007 for failure to maintain the payment 
schedule. In August 2007, Applicant satisfied a $6,118 property tax lien on the residence. 
(GE 2.) Around September 2007, Applicant resolved her mortgage with the proceeds from 
the sale of her home.
3
 Her credit report of November 2013 shows a zero balance on the 
mortgage as of September 2007. (GE 2; Tr. 43.) In October 2007, the gas company placed 
two debts for collection: $621(SOR 1.g) and $293 (SOR 1.h) (GE 2), which Applicant 
disputes on the basis that the debts were from her rental property that she no longer 
owned. (Answer; AE P.) 
 
Applicant had some college costs for her daughter’s education during the fall 2007 
and spring 2008 semesters. About her out-of-pocket costs, Applicant testified that she 
spent close to $5,000 in student loan costs for her daughter. (Tr. 68-69.) 
 
In August 2009, Applicant left her job with the healthcare company by mutual 
agreement of her employer following notice of unsatisfactory work performance.
4
 She had 
issues with her supervisor and was dissatisfied with the work environment. (GE 1; Tr. 34-
35.) Applicant did not have a full-time job from August 2009 to May 2011. She collected 
                                                 
2 
Applicant’s credit report of November 2013 shows that she paid off her mortgage by September 2007. (GE 2; 
Tr. 43.) Applicant testified that the rental property was also resolved in that she “ended up in foreclosure” 
before she filed for bankruptcy. (Tr. 42, 53-54.) Her November 2013 credit report shows only one foreclosure, 
which was for the timeshare loan. 
 
3 
Applicant indicated on her e-QIP that she owned her home from May 2004 to April 2010. (GE 1.) Available 
credit information shows that she owed a zero balance on her mortgage as of September 2007. (GE 2.) 
 
4 
Applicant’s paycheck dated August 21, 2009, shows her annual wages totaled $33,207.20. (AE M.) 
 
 5 
unemployment for about 1.5 years of that time. (Tr. 35-36.) Around March 2009, her 
student loans were placed in collection for nonpayment. In December 2009, she 
consolidated her student loan debt. She owed $19,801.97 (SOR 1.d) and $11,754.62 
(SOR 1.e). (GE 2; AE A.) 
 
 As of May 2010, Applicant owed $1,851 in past-due debt for electric utility services 
(SOR 1.f). A $60 Internet services debt from June 2011 was assigned for collection in 
December 2012 (SOR 1.i.). In July 2011, the resort foreclosed on Applicant and her sister’s 
timeshare loan for failure to make their $144 monthly payments (SOR 1.k) (GE 2.) 
 
 Having had little success in finding a job outside of the real estate industry, 
Applicant returned to work as a realtor in May 2011, but she earned little to nothing in 
commissions. (Tr. 33.) She also did some temporary work through staffing agencies until 
September 2012, when she was placed with her current employer at a wage of $16 an 
hour. (GE 1; Tr. 36-39.) Applicant and her spouse began cohabiting and sharing expenses 
about six months before they married in November 2012. (Tr. 69-70.) 
 
 On October 20, 2013, Applicant completed and electronically certified to the 
accuracy of an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), which she 
then signed on October 21, 2013. In response to financial record inquiries, she listed her 
bankruptcy filings; her failure to timely file her income tax returns for tax year 2012; her 
delinquent real estate tax debt of $6,118, which she paid in 2007; and her delinquent 
student loans. She attributed her real estate tax and student loan delinquencies to lack of 
income to support her household. Applicant added that she had arranged to make eight 
payments starting in August 2013 to bring her student loans out of default status. (GE 1.) 
 
A check of Applicant’s credit on November 2, 2013, showed the following delinquent 
balances:  $1,856 on the tax lien (SOR 1.c, duplicated in 1.j); $21,007 and $12,460 on her 
student loans (SOR 1.d and 1.e); $1,851 in electric utility debt (SOR 1.f); $621 and $293 in 
natural gas debt (SOR 1.g and 1.h); and $60 in Internet services debt (SOR 1.i). A zero 
balance was reportedly owed on the timeshare loan after foreclosure (SOR 1.k). (GE 2.) 
 
On November 12, 2013, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant explained that she filed a Chapter 
13 bankruptcy petition in August 2006, which she had dismissed because she wanted to try 
and work out her debts (primarily her mortgage and student loans) with her creditors. Her 
second bankruptcy petition, which she filed in January 2007, was also dismissed. While 
she indicated that she was unable to make the payments on her income, she also claimed 
that the bankruptcy was dismissed because she wanted to work out her debts on her own. 
Applicant cited her unemployment as the reason for her delinquencies, including the 
property tax lien. She acknowledged that she had yet to file her 2012 income tax returns 
because she did not have the paperwork needed. She expected to file her delinquent 
federal return by December 2013 and anticipated a refund. When confronted about the 
other debts on her credit record, Applicant indicated that she was paying the minimum 
required on her student loans in the hope of bring her accounts current sometime in 2014. 
Applicant denied any knowledge of the electric and gas utility debts or the timeshare 
 
 6 
foreclosure. She expressed her belief that the $60 debt for cancelled Internet service and 
the $1,856 state tax lien for underpayment of income taxes for tax year 2001 had both 
been paid. Applicant expressed her intent to repay her outstanding debts. (GE 3.) 
 
Around February 2014, Applicant filed her delinquent federal income tax return for 
2012. (AE N.) She reported wages of $12,519, but also a $1,779 loss of business income 
from home-based cosmetic sales and real estate work. She continues to maintain her real 
estate license at a cost of $500 annually. (Tr. 96.) It is unclear whether she filed her state 
return at the same time, although she testified that she had filed all her delinquent returns. 
IRS records show that she filed more than one tax return for tax year 2013. (AE U.) Her 
federal income tax refund of $389 for 2012 was intercepted by the IRS and applied to her 
federal student loan debt in March 2014. (AEs N, T; Tr. 61-62.) 
 
To show her good faith and become eligible for a student loan rehabilitation 
program, Applicant paid $20 a month for eight months toward her student loans starting in 
September 2013. (AE S.) In late July 2014, she then entered into an agreement under 
which she has paid approximately $190 a month from mid-August through May 2015.
5
 
(AEs A, I, S; Tr. 48.) As of late April 2015, Applicant was current in her student loan 
payments. (GE 4; AEs I, S; Tr. 49-50.) The loan balances were $19,980.88 (SOR 1.d) and 
$11,860.82 (SOR 1.e). (AE S.) 
 
On December 5, 2014, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant largely because 
of the reportedly delinquent accounts on her credit record. Applicant received the SOR on 
December 11, 2014. On December 12, 2014, Applicant paid the $60 debt for Internet 
services. (AE B; Tr. 56-57.) Applicant paid $120.88 in December 2014, $121 in February 
2015, and $363 in May 2015 toward the $1,856 state tax lien from 2006. (AEs B, H; Tr. 
46.) Before then, she made payments of minimum amounts, $25 or $50, when she could 
afford to do so. (Tr. 46-47.) By cashier’s check on June 2, 2015, Applicant paid $1,643 to 
resolve the balance remaining on the 2006 state tax lien (SOR 1.c, duplicated in SOR 1.j). 
(AE R.) 
 
As of May 22, 2015, Equifax was reporting that Applicant has been making timely 
payments of $189 per month toward her student loans, which had a $31,840 current 
balance. Applicant had reportedly made no payments since March 2010 to the creditor in 
SOR 1.f. No other open accounts were shown on her credit record. (GE 4.) Applicant 
testified that she contacted the creditor to arrange for payments. Told that the debt was too 
old to be collected by the creditor, Applicant sent a $50 payment by money order in 
December 2014 anyway. (AE B; Tr. 51.) In January 2015, Applicant verbally disputed the 
gas bills identified in SOR 1.g and 1.h because they are from her former rental property. 
She never lived there and did not own it when the charges were incurred. (Tr. 52-53, 55-
56.) 
 
                                                 
5 
Payment records show that Applicant made payments of $210 in August 2014, $169.50 in September 2014, 
$191 in October and November 2014, $200 in December 2014, $179.16 for January 2015 (paid February 2, 
2015), $191 in late February 2015, $190 in March and April 2015, and $190.16 in late May 2015. (AE S.) 
 
 7 
Around May 31, 2015, Applicant reached out to the creditor holding the electric utility 
debt in SOR 1.f. She offered to make payments of $50 per month to address the $1,801 
balance. (AE O.) She submitted written disputes of the natural gas debts in SOR 1.g and 
1.h and the timeshare debt in SOR 1.k with Trans Union, Experian, and Equifax. (AE P.) 
As of the close of the record, there was no information about whether the electric company 
had accepted her repayment offer or whether the three credit reporting agencies had 
verified or removed the disputed debts from her credit profile.  
 
Applicant’s take-home pay averages $1,100 every two weeks. She has $8,000 in 
her 401(k) account at work. Her spouse works full-time for an aircraft manufacturer. He is 
paid an hourly wage. He earned $60,000 annually before suffering a back injury. His 
income declined to $38,000 in 2013 and 2014 because of his disability. (Tr. 70.) He was 
out of work for about three months in 2014, but he is currently working full time. (Tr. 73-74.) 
He currently handles the household bills. (Tr. 98.) Their monthly expenses include $1,900 
for rent. They pay $60 a month for Internet service and $220 for cell phones. They do not 
have cable television or car payments. (Tr. 99-100.) They purchased Applicant’s car in late 
2014 for $2,500 and paid it off in six installments. (Tr. 100-101.) Their monthly take-home 
pay basically covers their monthly expenses, debt payments (including $190 for her 
student loans, $154 in credit card payments, $50 for the debt in SOR 1.f, and $150 in 
financial assistance for family members), and savings of $150 ($50 for emergencies, $40 
for retirement, and $50 for college), although it falls somewhat short during the winter 
months because of heating costs. According to Applicant’s budget for 2015, she and her 
spouse take home $4,993 per month. Their expenses total $4,996, but $5,271 during the 
winter months. (AE V; Tr. 63-66.) 
 
The older of Applicant’s two sons lives with Applicant’s mother. He is unemployed 
and raising his two children, ages two and three as of May 2015, without help from his 
children’s mother. Applicant provides him some financial assistance that averages 
approximately $400. Applicant’s mother has had some health issues over the past few 
years that require Applicant’s time. She has missed work on occasion to bring her mother 
to medical appointments or care for her after surgery. Applicant’s employer has allowed 
Applicant to make up the lost time, so it has not had an impact on Applicant’s income. (Tr. 
71-73.) Applicant’s daughter lives on her own and works two jobs. Applicant pays for her 
daughter’s cell phone and sometimes her groceries. (Tr. 76.) Applicant estimates that she 
and her spouse have $100 to $200 a month in net income after paying their expenses and 
helping her children. (Tr. 76.) 
 
Applicant was given an overall rating of 4 out of a high of 5 for her work performance 
in 2014. She excelled in all areas assigned to her to assist her department in meeting its 
team goals. (AE C.) In a separate letter dated May 29, 2015, Applicant’s supervisor 
expressed his recommendation for Applicant “enthusiastically and without any reservation.” 
He has found Applicant to be a dedicated professional willing to assist in any way possible. 
(AE Q.) A co-worker authored a character reference letter attesting to Applicant’s ability to 
meet the challenges of a work flow that demands immediate attention. (AE E.)

Policies 
 
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.” 
(See Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) The standard that must be met for 
assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s 
loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the person to sensitive duties 
is clearly consistent with national security. (See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.) The Deputy Under 
Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated November 
19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by 
the Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel Management. Department of 
Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the 
Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.  
  
When evaluating an Applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the 
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the 
“whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on 
the evidence contained in the record.  
  
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The Applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision.  
  
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. See Executive Order 12968, 
Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
  
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 
 9 
The trustworthiness concerns about Financial Considerations are set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 Applicant’s record of financial delinquency implicates AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial 
obligations.” She filed twice for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in an effort to save her home, but 
could not make the payments. In addition, she defaulted on her student loans. She was 
past due on an electric utility services debt of $1,851 as of November 2013. A state tax 
debt of $1,856 went unpaid for several years. A $60 Internet services debt in collection 
since December 2012 was apparently overlooked. 
 
 Applicant disputes two natural gas debts in collection that were reported on her 
credit record as of November 2013 (SOR 1.g and 1.h). She also disputes her liability for the 
timeshare loan in that she contacted the creditor and cancelled the purchase within three 
days. As noted by the DOHA Appeal Board, credit reports are ordinary business records 
which are routinely accepted in DOHA proceedings, and Department Counsel is entitled to 
rely on the evidence in credit reports. However, an applicant can contest the accuracy of 
the information in a credit report.

 See e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-12184 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 
2010); ISCR Case No. 07-08925 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2008). The information about the gas 
debts is from November 2007 with no update since then. AG ¶ 20(e) provides for mitigation 
under the following circumstance: 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
AG ¶ 20(e) is not satisfied regarding the natural gas balances of SOR 1.g and 1.h without 
some evidence that would indicate she no longer owned the property when the debts were 
incurred. It is reasonable to assume that the debts were incurred sometime before the 
collection date of October 2007. Even assuming that the debts were incurred by tenants, 
Applicant would be legally liable for unpaid balances on any account in her name.

In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained:  
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally meet the 
substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 
for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden shifts to applicant to establish either that 
she is not responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply.  
 
(internal citation omitted).

 The SOR alleges, and Applicant denies any liability for the alleged $3,617.51 
deficiency balance on the timeshare loan written off as a bad debt. The burden is on the 
Government to prove the debt. There is no evidence of the alleged deficiency balance. 
While Applicant admits that she made no payments on the timeshare loan, the evidence 
does not substantiate that she owes a balance on the loan. Her consolidated credit report 
of November 2013 shows a zero balance on the account. The source of the reported 
deficiency balance is unclear. As to any outstanding liability, AG ¶ 20(e) is established with 
respect to the timeshare. 
 
 Finally, about her failure to file a timely federal income tax return for tax year 2012, 
Applicant candidly disclosed on her October 2013 e-QIP and during her November 2013 
interview with the OPM investigator that she had not yet filed her 2012 federal income tax 
return. In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant indicated that she filed her return in February 
2014, before the SOR was issued. The return submitted in evidence as AE N does not 
bear a signature date or show when it was filed. However, the IRS notified Applicant on 
March 26, 2014, that her expected refund for tax year 2012 would be applied to her 
delinquent federal student loans. This tends to substantiate Applicant’s assertion in her 
Answer to the SOR that she filed her return in February 2014. AG ¶ 20(g), “failure to file 
annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the 
same” applies, but it is mitigated by AG ¶ 20(e) in that her return was not delinquent as of 
December 2014 when the SOR was issued. 
 
 Concerning other potentially mitigating conditions, AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior 
happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment,” is difficult to satisfy. Applicant’s failed bankruptcies 
occurred between 2006 and 2007, and the mortgage issue that led to her repeated filing for 
bankruptcy was resolved through sale of her home. Applicant subsequently defaulted on 
student loans consolidated in 2009. She is credited with taking steps to rehabilitate the 
student loans starting in September 2013. Yet, she also made little effort to resolve a 2006 
state income tax lien and a $1,851 electric utility debt from 2010. 
 
 Applicant was unable to maintain her $2,888 monthly mortgage payments on her 
unemployment compensation after she lost her job with the energy company in July 2004. 
One has to question Applicant’s judgment in purchasing a home for $560,000 when she 
was a single parent and receiving no child support from her ex-husband for their three 
children. Even so, her bankruptcy filings are reasonably attributed to factors outside of her 
control in that it was her then employer’s decision to close its local office and eliminate her 
position. AG ¶ 20(b) provides for mitigation in such circumstances: 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
 
 
 11 
 Applicant became employed in the healthcare industry, but at lower income than she 
had previously earned. She managed to resolve a $6,118 local property tax lien around 
August 2007, on the sale of her home. A January 2006 state income tax lien went unpaid 
as she gave priority to supporting herself and her three children, including paying 
approximately $5,000 in college costs for her daughter’s education. A subsequent, lengthy 
unemployment from August 2009 to May 2011 caused if not contributed to her utility 
delinquency in SOR 1.f and to her student loan default. AG ¶ 20(b) would not apply 
because she resigned voluntarily from her job following allegations of unsatisfactory 
performance. At the same time, Applicant continued to receive no child support for her 
youngest son not yet 18. 
 
 Before the SOR was issued, Applicant had rehabilitated her federal student loans 
(SOR 1.d and 1.e) and had filed her delinquent income tax return for tax year 2012 (SOR 
1.l). One day after she received the SOR, she paid the $60 debt for Internet services (SOR 
1.i). She made one $50 payment toward the electric utility delinquency (SOR 1.f) despite 
being told the debt could not be collected because of its age. She made payments totaling 
$604.88 between December 2014 and May 2015 toward the state tax lien (SOR 1.c, 
duplicated in SOR 1.j) before satisfying the debt with a lump-sum payment of $1,643 on 
June 2, 2015. Mitigating conditions AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving 
counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control,” and AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,” apply because of Applicant’s efforts in 
the past two years to address her delinquent debts. 
 
 As of the close of the evidentiary record, Applicant had no repayment plans 
established for the natural gas debts totaling $914 (SOR 1.g and 1.h). She was disputing 
those debts and the timeshare loan. It has not been established that Applicant owes a 
deficiency balance for the timeshare. As of May 2015, the electric utility debt in SOR 1.f 
was the only past-due account on Applicant’s credit record. She has offered to pay the 
electric utility provider $50 a month, but there is no evidence her offer had been accepted. 
She could owe approximately $2,715 in past-due utility charges, assuming that the $914 in 
natural gas debt is verified. 
 
 Applicant made timely payments on her student loans over the past two years, when 
her spouse had lower income due to temporary disability. While their current household 
budget shows some strain during the winter months because of heating costs, Applicant 
has persuaded me that she can be counted on to handle her finances responsibly. The 
security concerns about her financial judgment are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality 
of an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(a).

The factors under AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows: 
 
 
 12 
In making the whole-person assessment required under the Directive, the DOHA 
Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish 
resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to 
resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. See ISCR 
Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). The student loans, which account for 
most of Applicant’s outstanding debt, have been fully rehabilitated. When she answered 
the SOR, Applicant explained that her failure to comply with her obligation to timely file and 
pay income taxes for tax year 2012 was because of the demands of caring for her mother, 
who had significant health problems. Applicant’s delinquent filing was situational and not 
characteristic of her filing of her tax returns generally. For the reasons discussed above, I 
conclude it is clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant access to sensitive 
information at this time. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a-1.l: For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. 
Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.
