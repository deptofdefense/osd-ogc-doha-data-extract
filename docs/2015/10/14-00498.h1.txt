HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 14 violations of security rules. He 
admitted to nine security-related infractions from March 2012 through October 2013. 
Applicant’s conduct did not result in the compromise of classified or sensitive 
information.1 Applicant did not receive adequate training or supervision from his facility 
security officer (FSO), D, who showed poor leadership and was terminated or resigned 
from her employment in December 2013. Applicant took over as acting FSO; he 
obtained extensive security training; and he significantly improved his Department of 
Defense (DOD) employer-contractor’s (C) security. Handling protected information 
security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 15, 2010, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security clearance application (SF 86). 
(GE 1) On May 6, 2014, the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an 
SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD 
                                            
1 Department Counsel conceded and Applicant agreed that no spillage or compromise of 
classified information resulted from the infractions of security rules, and Applicant went to great lengths to 
education and train himself on security rules and requirements. (Tr. 12-13, 143)

Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), 
which became effective on September 1, 2006.    
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline K (handling protected 
information). (HE 2) The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s 
access to classified information and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked. (HE 2)  
 
On July 10, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing. (HE 3) On April 29, 2015, Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On 
May 7, 2015, the case was assigned to me. On September 3, 2015, the Defense Office 
of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a hearing notice setting the hearing for 
September 24, 2015. Department Counsel offered five exhibits into evidence, and 
Applicant offered 11 exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 17-20, 47-50; Government Exhibit (GE) 
1-5; Applicant Exhibit (AE) 1-11) There were objections to Applicant’s exhibits that went 
to the weight of the evidence, and all exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 18-20, 
47-50) On October 2, 2015, DOHA received the transcript of the hearing. The record 
closed on October 2, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, he made detailed admissions about nine of the 
fourteen incidents alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.n. (Tr. 140) Several of the SOR 
allegations were duplications of other SOR allegations. He also provided clarifying, 
extenuating, and mitigating information as part of his SOR response. Applicant’s 
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 33-year-old private security specialist and former acting FSO. (Tr. 
5-6; GE 1) When he was a senior in college, he received the Reserve Officer Training 
Corps (ROTC) award for the Marine Corps cadet with the best grades and leadership 
ratings. (Tr. 52) He graduated from college in 2005. (Tr. 51) He served on active duty as 
an intelligence officer in the Marine Corps from 2005 to 2010, and he received an 
honorable discharge. (Tr. 10, 53, 115) In 2008 and 2009, he served in the Marine Corps 
in Iraq for a total of two tours, and part of his duties involved working with classified 
documents. (Tr. 51-55) In January 2010, he left active duty; however, he elected to 
remain in the Marine Corps Reserve. (Tr. 57) He has served in the Reserve as an 
intelligence officer, and he has been selected for promotion to major. (Tr. 57) His 
promotion to major is on hold until his security clearance issues are resolved. (Tr. 58) 
There is no evidence of illegal drug use, criminal offenses, or alcohol abuse. Applicant 
is married, and his daughter is one year old. (Tr. 112) 
                                            
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

In March 2010, C hired Applicant as a security specialist with a focus in 
operational security. (Tr. 58) From March 2010 to May 2011, his supervisor and rater at 
C was S. (Tr. 59) He worked on threat assessments involving DOD contractor 
employees serving overseas and protecting classified documents in overseas facilities. 
(Tr. 60-62) C has several facilities in the United States and in foreign countries. C’s 
facility where Applicant works is massive. (Tr. 63) It is about a mile long and in some 
parts about one-quarter mile deep. (Tr. 62-63) It has a fence, guards, video cameras, 
card-reader systems, and other physical security measures to establish security-in-
depth. (Tr. 63)  
 
Applicant has been authorized to be absent from his employment at C on 
multiple occasions. He was TDY to Korea and otherwise in 2012 and 2013, as well as to 
a Marine Corps course from March through May 2013. (Tr. 64, 136) He missed some 
security updates or changes in policy that D issued while he was away from work at C. 
(Tr. 136-137) On April 5, 2013, D provided Applicant’s calendar year (CY) 2012 CY 
evaluation to Applicant. (AE 8 at 8) The rating cited three security or DOD Manual 
5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program (NISPOM) (Feb. 28, 2006) violations 
and said Applicant’s “understanding of the NISPOM was limited and required extensive 
education . . . for the last 3 months, your understanding of the NISPOM grew. 
Continued growth is needed.” (AE 8, 2012 CY evaluation at 2, 3) The 2012 CY 
evaluation also indicated that the 2012 Defense Security Service (DSS) assessment 
determined that security records were not accurate and “DSS advised that [C] was 
ineligible for an enhancement credit.” (AE 8, 2012 CY evaluation at 2) Applicant 
acknowledged that his 2012 CY evaluation made him realize it was important for him to 
improve his knowledge of the NISPOM. (Tr. 65)  
 
Applicant’s 2013 CY evaluation showed an overall rating of “Strong Contributor” 
with performance and growth ratings of “Consistently Meets Expectations.” (AE 8, 2013 
CY evaluation at 1) His supervisor said, “Additionally, he needs to continue to apply the 
lessons learned from various security incidents to preclude recurrence. This is 
especially true in the area of routine security procedures to include end-of-day checks 
and transmittal of classified materials.” (AE 8, 2013 CY evaluation at 5)   
 
In May 2013, Applicant returned from TDY, and he began working diligently to 
complete security-related courses in addition to working to correct the deficiencies DSS 
found in their inspection. (Tr. 66) Applicant provided certificates showing he completed 
19 security courses from June through July 2013. (AE 7) He completed two additional 
security courses in January 2015. (AE 7) 
 
In November 2013, D was removed from employment as FSO at C. (Tr. 102) 
Even though Applicant was not the Assistant FSO, he was appointed as the acting 
FSO. (Tr. 102) For CY 2014, he received an “Excellent” overall evaluation with 
“Exceeds Expectation” or “Consistently Meets Expectations” in all categories. (AE 8 at 
1-9) C recently promoted Applicant from the Assistant FSO job, and he has resumed his 
responsibility for threat assessments and training for his employer’s overseas offices 
and personnel. (Tr. 67, 110-112)

Handling Protected Information 
 
Loss of Classified Information 
 
The most serious SOR allegation is Applicant’s alleged failure to timely report an 
engineer-custodian’s (EC) loss of three classified documents in June 2012. Under 
NISPOM paragraph 1-300, when “classified information has been lost or compromised” 
Contractor employees are required to report the loss to his FSO, and an FSO or the 
contractor is required to report the loss to the cognizant “Federal authorities.” Under 
NISPOM, paragraph 1-302a, “Contractors shall report adverse information coming to 
their attention concerning any of their cleared employees.” Under NISPOM paragraph 1-
303, “Classified material that cannot be located within a reasonable period of time shall 
be presumed to be lost until an investigation determines otherwise” and must be 
reported to the cognizant security agency (CSA) in this situation, DSS. 
 
Applicant contended that he and another C security specialist (SE2) timely 
reported the loss of three classified documents to FSO D, and D denied that he did so. 
Applicant believed that SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.k, and 1.n related to the same alleged security 
infraction. (Tr. 117-118; SOR response) SOR ¶ 1.n alleges on June 11, 2012, Applicant 
did not adequately secure classified information, and he did not report missing classified 
documents in a timely manner. SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.k allege that on July 13, 201[2], 
Applicant was tasked to audit all GSA containers at EC’s office, and that Applicant failed 
to timely report missing classified information to the FSO. (Tr. 117) Applicant and SE2 
were directed to inventory eight or nine safes holding classified material in EC’s office. 
(Tr. 76) Some of the classified documents dated to the 1970s. (Tr. 76) EC had occupied 
the area for decades, was “a pack rat,” and his area was “a mess.” (Tr. 77) As a result 
of the audit, numerous unneeded classified documents were shredded. (Tr. 78)  
 
Applicant and SE2 could not locate six documents that should have been in the 
safes. (Tr. 76) Immediately after the audit, Applicant and SE2 reported to D that the 
audit had failed to locate three documents; however, D denied that she received any 
such report from Applicant or SE2. (Tr. 76, 120-121,126) Applicant told an Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he waited more than 24 hours, but less 
than 48 hours to report the missing documents to D. (Tr. 126) He also told the OPM 
investigator that the requirement was to report lost classified documents within 24 
hours. (Tr. 125)3 D told them to work with the custodian of the documents and try to find 
them. (Tr. 79) EC located three of the six documents; however, they were never able to 
locate three classified documents. (Tr. 79-80) They presumed the three missing 
documents were destroyed at some time in the past. (Tr. 79) Another audit was 
conducted of EC’s office in July 2012, and the auditors were unable to locate three 
classified documents. (AE 11 at 14-19)  
                                            
3Applicant’s responses in the OPM interview may have been inaccurate in some details because 
he did not have an opportunity to review the security documents relating to the incidents. (Tr. 141-142) 
The documents he subsequently reviewed refreshed his memory of the various security infractions. (Tr. 
142) The OPM investigator did not obtain a written statement from Applicant, and instead, the OPM 
investigator generated a summary of what he believed Applicant told him.

Another security employee of the DOD contractor, SE1, and D, each generated a 
separate July 13, 2012 report about the loss of the three classified documents by EC. 
(SE 1’s report is AE 11 at 14-19; D’s report is AE 11 at 20-23) SE1’s report said that at 
the time of the second audit, on July 9, 2012, six classified documents were missing, 
and three were subsequently found by EC. (AE 11 at 15 note 3) D said she reported the 
loss. (AE 11 at 23) However, apparently she did not report the loss to DSS because the 
DSS agent said at the hearing that she received these two incident reports in June 2013 
from D along with the other four reports citing Applicant for security infractions. (Tr. 24-
25) SE1’s July 13, 2012 incident report indicated on June 12, 2012, Applicant asked EC 
to look for nine specified missing classified documents. (AE 11 at 15 note 4) SE1 said 
that she “was unable to find any evidence that [Applicant and SE2] timely advised FSO 
D of the missing classified [documents], conducted any follow-up with [EC] and/or filed 
any timely reports with the Defense Security Service.” (AE 11 at 15 note 4)  
 
Applicant conceded he should have documented his report of the missing 
documents, and he should have insisted that D report the loss to DSS. (Tr. 118-119; 
SOR response) D directed the audit in June 2012, and it is unlikely that she did not ask 
Applicant and SE1 to report the results of the audit in June 2012. In light of D’s failure 
as FSO to timely inform DSS of the losses of the three Secret-level documents for one 
year (June or July 2012 to June 2013), and D’s termination or resignation from 
employment with the DOD contractor, I resolve the credibility conflict between D and 
Applicant against D. D’s claim that Applicant and SE2 did not tell D of the loss of 
classified documents in June 2012 shortly after the audit by Applicant and SE2 is not 
credible.   
 
A May 31, 2013 JPAS entry for Applicant indicates for July 13, 2012, “No 
Compromise—Failure to report missing classified information in a timely manner to FSO 
(Culpability of loss determined to lie with a different employee).” (GE 5) A follow-up 
June 7, 2013 JPAS entry indicates for “11 June 2012,” Applicant “did not adequately 
secure classified information nor did he report missing classified documents in a timely 
manner.” (GE 5 at 1) D was the author of the JPAS entries. 
 
Security Infractions Unrelated to Loss of Classified Information 
  
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges on October 13, 2013, Applicant improperly mailed classified 
information to a subcontractor without confirming the address was correct. A security 
employee of the DOD contractor, SE3, was supposed to generate the documentation to 
mail a classified package, and Applicant was assisting SE3 with the mailing. (Tr. 95, 
100) The package was double wrapped; SE3 put the wrong address on it; and Applicant 
put the same wrong address on the inside layer of the package. (Tr. 96-97; GE 4 at 2) 
The inner package had the correct makings for classified materials. (GE 4 at 2) The 
package went to the correct entity, S (a sub-office of C); however, the address at S for a 
classified package was different than for an unclassified package. (Tr. 96) There is a 
cleared person in S’s unclassified mailroom to bring packages to the S’s classified 
mailroom when situations like this occur. (Tr. 96-97) In this instance, the cleared person 
in S’s mailroom gave the package to S’s FSO, who contacted D. (Tr. 97) The incident 
report is dated October 21, 2013. (GE 4 at 2)

SOR ¶ 1.c alleges on November 15, 2013, Applicant transmitted a classified CD 
to S before ensuring it had an approved information system specific to the CD. The 
incident report is dated November 15, 2013; however, the CD was received at S on 
October 9, 2013. (GE 4 at 1) Applicant was told to send a classified CD to S, and since 
he personally knew the addressee from other shipments, he mailed the CD to S. (Tr. 
98) S’s security officer looked at the DD Form 254 associated with the project, and 
noted the DD Form 254 lacked “an approved information system specific to the CD.” 
(GE 4 at 1) Accordingly, S’s security office was unable to properly log in and accept the 
CD. (Tr. 98; GE 4 at 1) It took S’s security officer from October 9, 2013, to November 5, 
2013 to review his installation’s DD Form 254. (GE 4 at 1) On November 14, 2013, after 
discussing the matter with D, S’s security officer mailed the CD back to Applicant’s 
security office. (Tr. 98-99; GE 4 at 1) Applicant believed S’s DD Form 254 was 
subsequently changed, and the CD was re-mailed back to S. (Tr. 99)       
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e allege on May 14, 2013, and May 22, 2013, Applicant failed 
to fully complete end-of-day checks on GSA security containers that contained 
classified material at the Secret level. (AE 11 at 1-5) Applicant conceded that after 
checking to ensure all safes were locked, he failed to initial and date the SF 702s on the 
top of one of the safes on two dates in May 2013. (Tr. 93-94) The incident report is 
dated May 17, 2013. (AE 11 at 1-5) D also said in the incident report that she would 
enter this report in JPAS. (AE 11 at 2-3)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges on March 7, 2013, Applicant inadvertently provided incorrect 
security information involving his authorization of cellular phone possession in C’s 
reproduction room. Applicant erroneously believed cell phone possession was 
unrestricted; however, cellular phone possession was actually prohibited. C had a room 
with “millions” of documents in it, and C hired a subcontractor to organize the 
documents. (Tr. 90-91) A document classified at the confidential level was discovered in 
the room. (Tr. 90) There was a sign inside the room indicating cell phones were 
supposed to be placed in a box. (Tr. 91) Applicant did not know whether or not the area 
was restricted for cell phone possession or not. (Tr. 91-92) Applicant had not seen 
documentation on whether it was a restricted area or not. (Tr. 90-92) In March 2013, D 
advised Applicant that the area was restricted and cell phone possession was not 
permitted. (Tr. 93) Applicant conceded he gave incorrect information to contractors 
about possessing cell phones in the restricted room. (Tr. 134)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges on February 19, 2013, Applicant failed to engage an S&G lock 
on a closed area, containing material at the Secret level, thereby leaving the area 
alarmed but unlocked for nearly 26 hours. Applicant was called and asked to escort fire 
inspectors inside a room containing classified material at the Secret level to check a gas 
line. (Tr. 87; GE 3 at 1-4) After the fire inspectors were done, they exited the room. (Tr. 
88) Applicant spun the dial, and heard the lock click once. (Tr. 88; GE 3 at 2) He pulled 
the handle on the door, and the door was locked. (Tr. 88) He checked the alarm by 
calling the guards, and they alarmed the door. (Tr. 88-89; GE 3 at 2) Applicant failed to 
sufficiently spin the dial for two clicks to occur, and the lock was not fully engaged. (Tr. 
89) Applicant learned there was a written report on his failure to fully engage the S&G 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
lock when they were cleaning out D’s office and discovered a file with a report on this 
incident in it. (Tr. 89-90) The report was dated February 22, 2013. (GE 3 at 1-4) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges on February 12, 2013, Applicant failed to alarm a secure 
COMSEC area, containing material at the Secret level, thereby leaving the area locked 
but unalarmed for over four hours. One of the rooms that the scheduled end-of-day 
security person is supposed to check has a unique lock and alarm system. (Tr. 84-87) 
At the end of the day, Applicant checked the door and noted the SF 702 was already 
completed by a user of the room, as they are supposed to do when the last person 
leaves for the day. (Tr. 84-87) He spun the dial on the lock and pulled the door handle, 
to ensure the door was properly locked. (Tr. 85-86) The alarm sign was flipped, 
indicating the alarm was engaged. (Tr. 85-86) Applicant would have had to open the 
door, set the alarm, exit the room, and lock the door. (Tr. 86) He elected to rely on the 
alarm sign being flipped, and the user’s initials and date on the SF 702 instead of 
personally entering the room and checking the alarm system. The incident report is 
dated February 18, 2013. (GE 3 at 9-10; See SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges on September 17, 2012, Applicant failed to complete end-of-
day checks on two GSA security containers. Applicant was responsible for checking to 
ensure approximately 17 GSA safes were secured at the end of the day. (Tr. 82) The 
safes are in a row, and Applicant is sure he spun each of the dials to ensure they were 
locked; however, he failed to initial and date the SF 702s on two safes. (Tr. 83, 134; AE 
11 at 11) The logs are dated from June through September 2012, and the logs for one 
of the safes do not have initials and dates for several end-of-day checks which are in a 
separate column on the SF 702. (AE 11 at 7-10, 13) There are initials and dates in the 
user column. (AE 11 at 7-10, 13)        
 
SOR ¶ 1.j alleges on August 7, 2012, Applicant failed to complete end-of-day 
checks on a closed area for four out of five assigned days. Applicant was scheduled to 
check 17 safes at the end of the day to ensure they were locked, and he was required 
to initial and date each SF 702s, which were on top of each safe. (Tr. 79-80) D had a 
safe in her office. (Tr. 81) D’s policy was to check her own safe before leaving for the 
day, and then she would initial and date her safe’s SF 702 before locking her office door 
and going home. (Tr. 81) See, e.g, SF 702 in AE 11 at 7-10, 11. Applicant checked D’s 
office door and noted that it was locked before he left at the end of the day. (Tr. 81) 
Applicant did not have a key for her office. (Tr. 81, 134) In August 2012, D reminded 
Applicant that her policy required the scheduled end-of-day security check to include 
her office safe. (Tr. 82, 135) From the example SF 702’s provided, it appears the end-
of-day checks in some C locations may have been inconsistently initialed. (AE 11) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.l alleges on March 12, 2012, Applicant did not properly safeguard 
information classified at the Secret level. SOR ¶ 1.m alleges on March 16, 2012, 
Applicant mishandled information classified at the Secret level. Applicant believed SOR 
¶¶ 1.l and 1.m relate to the same incident. (Tr. 68, 122)4 Applicant had just begun 
                                            
4 The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) indicates there 
were two discrete security infractions in March 2012. One involved failing to supervise contractor

working for D. (Tr. 68) Applicant and another contractor employee went to the post 
office; they picked up a double-wrapped package containing classified information; and 
they brought the package to C’s security office, which is locked and alarmed. (Tr. 68, 
74) The package was too large to fit in the GSA safe in the security office. (Tr. 68) 
Applicant placed the double-wrapped package in the storage unit or closet and went to 
lunch with another employee of C. (Tr. 68-69, 74) DSS has certified the closet as a 
certified closed space on a DD Form 147, and it is locked and alarmed when the door is 
closed. (Tr. 69) The closet is located in the center of the security area, which is a closed 
office space. (Tr. 69) The closet already contained numerous classified items as well as 
supplies and two GSA-approved safes. (Tr. 69)  
 
D generated a document, dated March 16, 2012, indicating Applicant left 
packages containing Secret-level information “on top of a safe in an area not approved 
for open storage;” however, D also reported that the documents were “sitting in the 
vault.” (AE 11 at 24) D said her remedy was to discuss the matter at length with 
Applicant. (AE 11 at 26) D said the DD Form 147 showed the room was not cleared for 
open storage; however, Applicant said he believed the room was cleared for open 
storage, and that DSS had inspected the room and numerous classified items were 
being stored as though the room was open storage. (Tr. 73-74) About two months later, 
the DD Form 147 was changed to reflect open storage in the security area. (Tr. 75) The 
incident report is dated March 16, 2012. (AE 11 at 24-26)     
 
Statement from an Industrial Security Specialist (ISS) from the DSS 
 
A DSS ISS (P) described her oversight responsibility of C’s facility security. (Tr. 
20-21) P has a master’s degree and five DOD security-related certifications, and P has 
worked in security for eight years. (Tr. 21-22) The FSO at Applicant’s company was 
responsible for training employees and security personnel in security matters. (Tr. 22) In 
June 2013, D provided materials on Applicant’s six security-rule infractions to DSS as 
part of the annual vulnerability assessment. (Tr. 24-25) P said D was not required to 
provide the information about Applicant to DSS earlier when the infractions occurred 
because there was no evidence of a compromise or suspected compromise of classified 
information. (Tr. 24-25)5 D never disclosed any security infractions for which she was 
culpable. (Tr. 44) P explained that a DOD regulation required the holder of classified 
information: to properly transmit classified CDs; to conduct security checks; and to 
properly set cipher locks. (Tr. 27) The FSO is responsible for security in their assigned 
facility. (Tr. 28-31) D’s supervisor informed DSS that D was terminated or resigned from 
her employment at C on December 6, 2013, and Applicant became the FSO. (Tr. 28-31, 
138, 143; GE 2 at 12) 
 
DSS did not object to Applicant’s appointment as FSO. (Tr. 31) Applicant 
frequently consulted with DSS and P on security matters. (Tr. 31) DSS polls showed 
                                                                                                                                            
employees that were moving documents. (Tr. 123) The other incident involved leaving classified materials 
on top of a safe. (Tr. 124) 
 
5 P did not explain why the losses of three classified documents were not reportable.

that increased communications between FSOs and DSS improved facility security. (Tr. 
32) Applicant invited DSS to tour C, and he asked DSS to make suggestions about how 
to improve security. (Tr. 32) C had both open and closed storage areas. (Tr. 34) In an 
open storage area, a classified package can be left unattended in an “open-shelf bin 
storage” area. (Tr. 41) After Applicant took over as FSO, DSS noted that his company 
attempted to gain 100 percent accountability of all classified materials. (Tr. 35) There 
were thousands of classified documents, and some of which were decades old. (Tr. 35) 
There is no requirement to maintain accountability for Secret information—the 
requirement is to maintain accountability for Top Secret and higher-level information. 
(Tr. 45)  
 
After a DSS assessment in November 2014 to ensure NISPOM compliance and 
improve security, Applicant’s company received a superior rating from DSS. (Tr. 38; AE 
5) DSS wrote that C’s “SUPERIOR” rating was based on five accomplishments: (1) 
Applicant’s company sponsored an event involving the FBI and DSS; (2) additional 
annual security training opportunities for employees were made available; (3) a 100 
percent inventory of classified holdings and removal of unused documents was 
completed; (4) Applicant’s facility provided fingerprinting for other cleared companies in 
the area; and (5) security personnel upgraded their certifications and participated in 
security-related organizations. (AE 5) A superior rating from DSS is reserved for about 
ten percent of the best facilities in the area of security. (Tr. 106)6 Applicant was unaware 
of whether C previously received a superior rating. (Tr. 106)  
 
Applicant received training at DSS’ Center for the Development of Security 
Education, which provides the best security training in DOD. (Tr. 39-40) P said that 
Applicant, “had a very good relationship [with P] and he performed the duties as 
required.” (Tr. 42) When Applicant became the FSO, he “maintain[ed] contact with [P], 
regarding any type of clarification on any of the requirements.” (Tr. 42)  
 
Applicant received extensive training on security procedures. (Tr. 102) In 
November 2013, when he became acting FSO, he took action to correct deficiencies. 
(Tr. 102) He emphasized training of security personnel and C’s employees in security 
matters. (Tr. 103) He frequently briefed P at DSS about his priorities and plans for 
improving security. (Tr. 104) P and her replacement at DSS advised him on measures 
to improve security. (Tr. 105) Applicant and the other security personnel worked 
diligently to improve security in all areas. (Tr. 107-110) They emphasized attention to 
detail. (Tr. 110) In August 2014, Applicant’s employer hired a new FSO. (Tr. 105)  
 
Applicant admitted that he made mistakes, and he expressed sincere remorse for 
his errors. (Tr. 114, 145) He emphasized his determination to improve, avoid future 
errors, and establish his trustworthiness. (Tr. 114) He understands the relationship of 
security and protection of national security, and he takes security matters very seriously. 
(Tr. 144)     
 
                                            
6 In FY 2012, 8.3% of facilities received a superior rating from the Defense Security Service. (AE 
2 at 2)

Character Evidence  
 
Applicant provided 12 character statements from friends, coworkers, supervisors, 
corporate counsel, an active duty Marine Corps major, his pastor, and an associate 
pastor.7 The statements describe his Marine Corps service in peace and war, his work 
for C, and his personal life. They laud his dedicated service to the Marine Corps and his 
support for his family, church, and employer. The statements emphasize his diligence, 
professionalism, efforts at security improvement, conscientious compliance with rules, 
dependability, loyalty, honesty, trustworthiness, and contributions to mission 
accomplishment. 
   
Applicant provided his Marine Corps fitness reports. (AE 9) The trend shows 
improving duty performance. (AE 9) His 2013 fitness report describes an officer, who is 
“one of the few exceptionally qualified Marines” on the comparative assessment. (AE 9) 
He is on the promotion list for major. 
 
Applicant has the following military awards: two Iraq Campaign Medals; two Sea 
Service Deployment Ribbons; three Certificates of Appreciation; one Global War on 
Terrorism Service Medal; two Navy Unit Commendations; one Navy and Marine Corps 
Achievement Medal; one Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal; and one 
National Defense Service Medal. (AE 10)  He completed several Marine Corps training 
courses, and he received several certificates of achievement. (AE 10) 
             
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865. 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
                                            
7 The source for the information in this paragraph is AE 6. 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this 
decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Handling Protected Information  
 
  AG ¶ 33 articulates the security concern relating to handling protected 
information as follows, “Deliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and 
regulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an 
individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard 
such information, and is a serious security concern.” 
 
  AG ¶ 34 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(g) any failure to comply with rules for the 
protection of classified or other sensitive information;” and “(h) negligence or lax security 
habits that persist despite counseling by management.” 
 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Applicant admitted to nine security-related infractions from March 2012 through 
October 2013. D occasionally mentioned errors Applicant made to him and urged 
corrective action. Although he did not make the same error after being counseled, he 
made additional different security errors.  
 
On April 5, 2013, D provided Applicant’s evaluation for CY 2012 to Applicant. The 
2012 CY evaluation cited three security or NISPOM violations and said Applicant’s 
“understanding of the NISPOM was limited and required extensive education . . . for the 
last 3 months, your understanding of the NISPOM grew. Continued growth is needed.” 
The 2012 CY evaluation also indicated that the 2012 DSS assessment determined that 
security records were not accurate. His rating constitutes the only written counseling he 
received. The rating does not mention “lax security habits” or negligence. The rating 
emphasized that Applicant needed training on the NISPOM.  
 
After he was counseled in his 2012 CY evaluation on April 5, 2013, he was 
involved in two more security incidents. In October 2013, he was involved in two 
mistakes involving the mailing of classified material. The October 2013 mailing of 
classified material that went to an incorrect mailroom was not his fault as another 
employee addressed the package and completed the transaction documentation. In 
October 2013, he mailed a CD without adequate coordination with the security office 
receiving the CD. Although no specific provision of the NISPOM or any other security 
rule is cited, I conclude that Applicant should have known that he or someone in the 
security office should call ahead and let the receiving security office know what type of 
classified material is about to arrive at their office. He should not have relied on the 
requestor to properly coordinate the transfer. AG ¶¶ 34(g) and 34(h) apply.   
 
Three mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 35 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so 
infrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to 
recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security 
training and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of 
security responsibilities; and 
 
(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. 
  
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
 
13 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
AG ¶¶ 35(a) through 35(c) apply. Applicant realized it was important for him to 
improve his knowledge of the NISPOM. As soon as he returned from his TDY in May 
2013, he worked diligently to complete numerous security related courses in addition to 
working assiduously to correct the deficiencies DSS found in their inspection. Applicant 
was not responsible for the loss or compromise of any classified or sensitive 
information. Much of the responsibility for the infractions was due to Applicant not 
receiving adequate training or supervision from FSO D, who showed poor leadership 
and was terminated or resigned from her employment at C in December 2013. Applicant 
took over as security manager, and he significantly improved C’s security and his own 
security performance.    
 
  Applicant’s actions since returning from TDY in May 2013 show sufficient effort, 
good judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability to warrant mitigation of handling 
protected information security concerns. Even if handling protected information 
concerns are not mitigated under AG ¶¶ 35(a) through 35(c), they are mitigated under 
the whole-person concept, infra.    
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline K in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline K, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
 
14 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Applicant is a 33-year-old private security specialist and former acting FSO, who 
is currently focused on operational security at C. In November 2013, Applicant was 
appointed as the acting FSO. The DOD contractor recently promoted Applicant, and he 
is again responsible for threat assessment and training for his employer’s overseas 
offices and personnel. When he was a senior in college, he received the ROTC award 
for the Marine Corps cadet with the best grades and leadership ratings. He graduated 
from college in 2005, and he served on active duty in the Marine Corps from 2005 to 
2010, as an intelligence officer. He served two tours in Iraq with the Marine Corps. In 
January 2010, he left active duty; however, he elected to remain in the Marine Corps 
Reserve. He has served in the Reserve as an intelligence officer, and he has been 
selected for promotion to major.  
 
Applicant’s 12 character statements from friends, professional colleagues, and 
his pastor emphasize his diligence, professionalism, efforts at security improvement, 
conscientious compliance with rules, dependability, loyalty, honesty, trustworthiness, 
and contributions to mission accomplishment. There is no evidence of illegal drug use, 
criminal offenses, or alcohol abuse.  
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges 14 violations of security rules. He admitted to nine 
security-related infractions from March 2012 through October 2013. Applicant’s conduct 
did not result in the compromise of classified or sensitive information. He did not receive 
adequate training or supervision from his FSO, D, who showed poor leadership and was 
terminated or resigned from employment with C in December 2013. Applicant took over 
as FSO; he obtained extensive security training; and he significantly improved C’s 
security. C achieved a superior security rating from DSS, which is attributed in part to 
Applicant’s leadership and diligent efforts to improve security.  
 
Applicant understands what he needs to do to maintain his eligibility for access to 
classified information. He has avoided any hint of violation of security rules since 
October 2013. He expressed sincere remorse for his infractions of security rules and he 
emphasized his determination to conscientiously comply with all security rules and 
requirements. I am confident he will continue to conscientiously exercise his security 
responsibilities in the future.    
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Handling protected information concerns are mitigated, and eligibility for access 
to classified information is granted.
