HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges her debts were discharged under 
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in October 2005. Her SOR also alleges two 
judgments and eight delinquent or collection accounts, totaling $19,560. On August 29, 
2014, she and her husband filed for discharge of their nonpriority unsecured debts 
under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Most of the debts listed in the 2014 
bankruptcy are medical debts and student loan debts. Assuming her nonpriority 
unsecured debts were discharged in December 2014 or early 2015, three SOR debts 
are student loan debts, totaling $10,143, and there is no evidence they have been 
brought to and retained in current status. Financial considerations concerns are not 
mitigated. Her eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 16, 2014, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of an application for a public trust position (SF 
86). (Item 2) On September 26, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), 
dated January 2, 1992, as amended, and modified; DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006.    
 
The SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). (Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD was unable to find that it 
is consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility to 
occupy a public trust position, which entails access to sensitive information. (Item 1) 
The DOD CAF recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether 
access to sensitive information should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
Applicant provided an undated response to the SOR allegations, and she did not 
request a hearing. (Item 1) A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), 
dated July 18, 2015, was provided to her on August 13, 2015.1 Applicant did not 
respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on October 15, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a-1.k. 
(Item 1) She also provided mitigating information. Her admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 47-year-old licensed practical nurse (LPN) who has been 
employed by a defense contractor since December 2013.3 In 1986, she graduated from 
high school. In 2004, she received a degree or diploma from a technical college. In 
1987, Applicant married her spouse. In 1987 and 1999, her sons were born, and in 
1992 and 1995, her daughters were born. She has never served in the military. She was 
unemployed from February to May 2013 and from July 2009 to December 2009. There 
is no evidence of felony or misdemeanor charges, alcohol abuse, use of illegal drugs, or 
security or rule violations. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s May 16, 2014 SF 86 disclosed two negative financial issues: (1) An 
estimated $20,000 medical debt accrued because she and her children did not have 
medical insurance. She made $250 monthly payments until the debt went into 
collections and the payments increased; and (2) In August 2013, her home was sold at 
                                            
1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated July 23, 2015, 
and Applicant’s receipt is dated August 13, 2015. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that she 
had 30 days after her receipt to submit information.

information is available in the cited exhibits.

2014 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of an application for a public 
trust position (SF 86). (Item 2)

foreclosure after she and her husband were unable to make the required payments 
under their adjustable rate mortgage (ARM).  
 
Applicant’s SOR ¶ 1.a alleges her debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code in October 2005. Her May 28, 2014 credit report and SOR also allege 
two judgments and eight delinquent or collection accounts, totaling $19,560. The SOR 
allegations are as follows: ¶ 1.a (Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharged her debts in October 
2005), ¶ 1.b (judgment for $403), ¶ 1.c (judgment for $7,920), ¶¶ 1.d to 1.f (three 
delinquent student loans for $5,194; $3,170; and $1,779, and her May 28, 2014 credit 
report indicates the status is 120 days or more past due), ¶ 1.g (delinquent debt for 
$355), ¶ 1.h (collection account for $574); ¶ 1.i (collection account for $89); ¶ 1.j 
(collection account for $40); and ¶ 1.k (collection account for $36).    
 
In August 2014, Applicant filed for protection under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy 
Code. On Schedule F of Applicant’s August 2014 bankruptcy filing, Applicant and her 
husband disclosed $107,785 in unsecured nonpriority debt, and some of the largest 
debts are as follows: (1) a judgment for $7,920 on April 20, 2012; (2) six student loans 
for $10,143; $9,257; $27,633; $4,375; $10,751; and $6,419;4 (3) two medical judgments 
in 2012 for $1,004 and $1,703; and (4) a medical debt for $26,000.5 (Item 5) For most 
accounts, she indicated the amount of the claim was “unknown.”  (Item 5) 
 
On Schedules I and J of Applicant’s August 2014 bankruptcy filing, Applicant and 
her husband provided their budget. (Item 5) She disclosed income of $3,074, and her 
husband, a truck driver, disclosed income of $3,673. (Item 5) Their family net monthly 
income was $5,116; their monthly expenses were $4,777; and their net monthly 
remainder was $339. (Item 5) Their 2014 income up to August 29, 2014 was $47,580; 
their 2013 income was $53,053; and their 2012 income was $69,000. (Item 5) 
Beginning on August 1, 2014, the medical creditor seeking payment of a $26,000 debt 
                                            
4Applicant’s May 28, 2014 credit report indicates the status is pays as agreed for most of her 
student loans, but not the three student loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.f. 
 
5Applicant’s SOR does not allege that she failed to disclose several delinquent debts on her May 
16, 2014 SF 86 or that she had delinquent debts in addition to those listed on her SOR as possibly 
indicated on her 2014 bankruptcy filing on Schedule F. Listing a debt on Schedule F does not establish 
the debt is delinquent; however, it does show the existence of a debt. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 
(App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an 
SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). The allegation that financial information was not included on her SF 86 will not be 
considered for any purpose because Applicant has not had adequate notice and a full opportunity to 
collect and present evidence of mitigation. Discussion of the contents of her 2014 bankruptcy filing will be 
limited to the five criteria specified by the Appeal Board.

began garnishing $808 monthly from Applicant’s pay. (Item 5) Applicant received 
financial counseling in connection with her bankruptcy. (Item 5)  
 
Applicant explained that her delinquent debts resulted from limited income and 
lack of health insurance.6 Her family did not have health insurance from July 2009 to 
February 2014. She and her husband were both employed; however, their employers 
did not provide health insurance. They made payments for several years to their 
medical clinic; however, the collection agent sought larger payments. She did not 
provide specific information about how many payments were made or the amount of 
those payments. The medical creditor obtained an $800 monthly garnishment of 
Applicant’s salary, and she, in turn, filed for protection under Chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code. Her current employment provides health insurance for Applicant and 
her four children. She assured she would conscientiously protect sensitive information, 
and she is following a strict budget.  
  
Applicant’s FORM noted the absence of other mitigating information. The FORM 
explained that Applicant had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM “in which to submit a 
documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or 
explanation, as appropriate. If you do not file any objections or submit any additional 
information . . . your case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a 
determination based solely” on the evidence set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 2)  
 
 The DOHA letter conveying the FORM to Applicant reiterated that Applicant had 
a 30-day opportunity to submit evidence supporting her approval or continuation of 
access to sensitive information. Applicant did not file a response to the FORM.   
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Government’s authority to restrict access to 
classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified 
information. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access 
to information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. See Id. at 527.  
 
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”  
Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. “The standard that must be met for . . . 
assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s 
loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to 
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” Regulation ¶ 
                                            
6The source for the information in this paragraph is Applicant’s SOR response. (Item 1)

C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the 
procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination 
may be made. See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, an 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of 
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the 
whole person. An administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial 
and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
sensitive information.   
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security and trustworthiness suitability. See 
ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance [or access to sensitive information].” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity 
clearance [or trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
The protection of the national security and sensitive records is of paramount 
consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national 
security.” This decision is based on national security and is not a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant.

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a trustworthiness 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s SOR alleges 
her debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in October 2005. 
Her SOR also alleges two judgments and eight delinquent or collection accounts, 
totaling $19,560. In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal 
Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. (internal 
citation omitted).  
 
The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions. Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;7 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving her delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all of her SOR debts; however, she provided 
some mitigating information. Her family did not have health insurance from July 2009 to 
February 2014. She was unemployed from February to May 2013 and from July 2009 to 
December 2009. These are circumstances largely beyond her control that adversely 
affected her finances; however, she did not provide sufficient evidence that she acted 
responsibly under the circumstances. She did not provide a clear financial history of her 
payments to her medical creditors and on her student loans. 
 
                                            
7The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

Applicant obtained a discharge of her nonpriority unsecured debts under Chapter 
7 of the Bankruptcy Code in October 2005. (SOR ¶ 1.a) This resolution of her debts is 
not recent, and she is credited with mitigating this SOR allegation. It remains relevant as 
an indicator of a lengthy history of delinquent debt.  
 
Applicant is credited with mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g through 
1.j because those debts are nonpriority unsecured debts, and I presume they were 
discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in December 2014 or early 2015.  
 
Applicant’s student loans and other debt payments were stayed when she filed 
for bankruptcy in August 2014. She did not provide evidence of the payment history of 
her student loans before August 2014, or after her debts were discharged. Her three 
student loan debts in SOR debts in ¶¶ 1.d through 1.f, totaling $10,143, probably 
survived her bankruptcy, as they are probably priority debts. Her May 28, 2014 credit 
report indicates their status is 120 days or more past due. There is no evidence they 
have been brought to and retained in current status after her 2014 bankruptcy.  
 
Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances. She received ample 
notice of her delinquent debts raising trustworthiness concerns. Aside from the 
bankruptcy schedules, there is no financial documentation relating to her SOR creditors 
showing maintenance of contact with creditors,8 establishment of payment plans, 
disputes of debts, payments to creditors, or other evidence of progress or resolution of 
her SOR debts. She received financial counseling; however, mitigation is limited 
because there is insufficient evidence that her financial problems are being resolved, 
are under control, and will not occur in the future. Financial considerations concerns are 
not mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
Applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the

Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s access to sensitive 
information. Applicant is a 47-year-old LPN who has been employed by a defense 
contractor since December 2013. In 2004, she received a degree or diploma from a 
technical college. She was unemployed from February to May 2013 and from July 2009 
to December 2009. She and her husband have four children. Her family did not have 
health insurance from July 2009 to February 2014, and the family generated over 
$25,000 in medical debt, which eventually resulted in judgments and garnishment of 
Applicant’s salary. Her SOR alleges two judgments and eight delinquent or collection 
accounts, totaling $19,560. On August 29, 2014, she and her husband filed for 
discharge of their debts under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and I have presumed 
that her nonpriority unsecured debts were discharged in December 2014 or early 2015. 
Most of the debts listed on Schedule F of the bankruptcy are medical debts and student 
loan debts. Applicant is credited with mitigating the SOR allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
through 1.c and 1.g through 1.k. There is no evidence of felony or misdemeanor 
charges, alcohol abuse, use of illegal drugs, or security or rule violations. She 
contributes to her company and the Department of Defense.  
 
The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s access to sensitive 
information is more substantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial 
problems. Her nonpriority unsecured debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code in October 2005. Assuming her nonpriority unsecured debts were 
again discharged in December 2014 or early 2015, three SOR debts are student loan 
debts, totaling $10,143, and there is no evidence they have been brought to and 
retained in current status or resolved. She failed to provide sufficient documentation of 
her progress resolving her financial problems, which shows lack of financial 
responsibility and judgment and raises unmitigated questions about Applicant’s 
reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect sensitive information. See AG ¶ 18. 
More evidence of financial progress is necessary to mitigate trustworthiness concerns. 
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s eligibility for 
a public trust position, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
public trust position. Unmitigated financial considerations concerns lead me to conclude 
that grant or reinstatement of a public trust position to Applicant is not warranted at this 
time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or 
will not attain the state of reform necessary to justify the award of a public trust position 
in the future. With more effort towards resolving her past-due debts, and a documented 
track record of behavior consistent with her obligations, she may well be able to 
demonstrate persuasive evidence of her worthiness for access to sensitive information.

I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to sensitive information at this time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d through 1.f:  Against Applicant  
Subparagraphs 1.g through 1.k:  For Applicant   
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust 
position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.
