Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke an existing security
clearance to work in the defense industry. She has a history of financial problems
consisting of delinquent student loans, which have since been through a period of
forbearance and are now being paid. She presented sufficient evidence to explain and
mitigate her problematic financial history. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on May 9, 2013.  After reviewing the application and1
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

(DOD),  on December 24, 2014, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR),2
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant her eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to a3
complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action under the security guideline known as
Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant answered the SOR on January 21,
2015, and requested a hearing.  
The case was assigned to me on May 1, 2015. The hearing was held as
scheduled on June 3, 2015. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1–6, and they were
admitted. Applicant offered Exhibit A, and it was admitted. She did not call any
witnesses other than herself. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on June 11,
2015.
The record was kept open to provide Applicant an opportunity to submit
additional documentation concerning the student loan accounts. On June 8, 2015, she
made a timely submission, and those documents are admitted, without objections, as
Exhibits B–F. 
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 40-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance
previously granted to her. She is employed as a software engineer for a major defense
contractor and industrial corporation. She is currently leading a small group of software
engineers who are working on a project to upgrade a weapons system. She has worked
for the same company since 2000. Her educational background includes a bachelor of
science degree awarded in 1999. She has lived at the same residence since 2002.   
Applicant has a history of financial problems consisting of delinquent student
loans, which she does not dispute. The SOR allegations consist of seven delinquent
student loans for a total of about $52,000. In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted
the delinquencies. Her problematic financial history is also documented and established
by credit reports from 2013–2015.  4

Applicant presented documentary evidence that the loans were no longer
delinquent as of January 2015.  In addition, the most recent credit report from March5
2015 shows that the loans had past-due balances of $0.00. 
After receiving the SOR, Applicant contacted the student loan creditor, which in
turn placed the loans in forbearance until April 28, 2015, with an initial payment due
May 28, 2015. She made a timely payment of $544.84 on June 1, 2015, and a recent
account statement shows a current balance of $55,023 for the seven student loans,
which are in good standing with $0.00 past due and $0.00 in late fees.  In addition to the6
most recent payment, the payment history (last five payments) consists of an $850
payment on May 23, 2014, and $428 payments on February 3, 2014, November 28,
2013, November 6, 2013, and September 28, 2013.  Consistent with the 2013–20147
payment history, a July 2013 credit report shows five of the student loans were then in
collection.  8
Applicant attributed her delinquent student loans to incurring expenses for her
son’s education. Her son finished high school in 2013, and he is now a 20-year-old
college student who is attending a small private college on an athletic scholarship. Her
out-of-pocket college expenses for her son have been about $2,000 to $3,000 yearly,
except for his freshman year (2013–2014), when she paid about $13,000 for his first-
year tuition and costs.  Before college, she paid for her son to attend a private school9
for grades 6–12. She estimated the cost for grades 8–12 at about $11,000 annually.   10
Applicant believes she will be able to maintain the monthly payment on the
student loans now that her son’s educational expenses have decreased. She earns an
annual salary in the $80,000 range, is a homeowner with a current mortgage loan, and
owns, outright, a small, inexpensive home in her home state that her family looks after.
She has a 401(k) account with an estimated balance of about $100,000, and she had
on hand about $2,500 in bank accounts.  Other than the delinquent student loans, the11
credit reports show that Applicant has been a responsible user of credit.

Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As12
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt13
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An14
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  15
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting16
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An17
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate18
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme19
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.20
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.21
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
 Executive Order 10865, § 7.22
 AG ¶¶ 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 23
 ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that “the security suitability of an applicant24
is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness or recurring
financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In
security clearance cases, “the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances
surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation
omitted). 
 AG ¶ 18.  25

decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it22
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
In analyzing this case, I have paid special attention to Applicant’s credibility.
During the hearing, I had an opportunity to observe her demeanor and evaluate her
sincerity, candor, and truthfulness. Applicant answered questions openly and without
reservation or equivocation, and I found her testimony to be credible in all respects.
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant23
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 24
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  25
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly compromise
classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It encompasses
concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important qualities. A
person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or
negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. Taken together, the evidence indicates inability or unwillingness

to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning26 27
of Guideline F. 
 In mitigation, I have considered six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and28
I have especially considered the following as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control; and
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
Applicant defaulted on student loans when she diverted money to pay for her
son’s educational expenses. Although her motivation was understandable, it was not
related to a circumstance beyond her control. She also broke her contractual agreement
or promise to pay her student loan creditor. Nevertheless, she has since remedied the
situation. Once she received the SOR in December 2014 and became fully cognizant of
the Government’s concern, she took prompt action to contact the student loan creditor.
The loans were then placed in forbearance with an agreement to resume monthly
payments, which she did on a timely basis. She also provided complete documentation
of her interaction with the student loan creditor during January–June 2015, to include
account statements and proof of her initial payment. Moreover, with the substantial
decrease in her son’s educational expenses, she has sufficient cash flow to adhere to
the monthly payment schedule. For all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant
mitigated the Guideline F security concern based on initiating a good-faith effort to
repay her overdue student loans, and that there are clear indications that the problem is
being resolved or is under control.  
Applicant’s history of financial problems no longer creates doubt about her
reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In
reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the
favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due
consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I conclude that she met her29
ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.

Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest

granted.
