HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges state tax debts for 2007 and 
2008, failure to timely file her state tax returns for 2010 through 2012, and two medical 
collection accounts totaling $566. She failed to file her state tax returns as required, and 
she failed to provide sufficient documentation of her progress in resolving her financial 
problems. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 12, 2013, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security clearance application (SF 86). 
(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On April 2, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to 
Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, 
dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 
1, 2006.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s access 
to classified information and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be continued or revoked. (HE 2) 
 
On May 8, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing. (HE 3) On July 21, 2015, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On July 
30, 2015, the case was assigned to me. On August 12, 2015, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice setting Applicant’s hearing for 
September 17, 2015. Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled. On September 28, 
2015, DOHA received the transcript of Applicant’s hearing. Department Counsel offered 
seven exhibits into evidence, and Applicant offered six exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 16-
19; Government Exhibit (GE) 1-7; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-F) All proffered exhibits were 
admitted into evidence without objection. (Tr. 17, 19-20; GE 1-7; AE A-F) Applicant was 
given until October 1, 2015, to submit additional evidence. (Tr. 46) On October 1, 2015, 
Applicant provided one exhibit with 18 pages, which was admitted into evidence without 
objection. (AE G) 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 
1.c, and 1.e. She denied responsibility for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d because she was 
unable to identify the debt. She provided extenuating and mitigating information as part 
of her SOR response. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 29-year-old computer specialist, who has worked for defense 
contractors for about two years.2 (Tr. 6, 8, 24; GE 1) In 2003, she graduated from high 
school. (Tr. 6) She has completed about 112 quarter credits towards a bachelor’s of 
science degree in computer networking. (Tr. 7) She has never been married, and she 
does not have any children. (Tr. 7) She has never served in the military. (Tr. 7; GE 1) 
She currently holds a security clearance. (Tr. 8, 25) There is no evidence of security 
violations or abuse of alcohol.   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
In 2007, Applicant began working full time for the first time in her life. (Tr. 21) She 
failed to withhold sufficient funds to pay her taxes. (Tr. 21, 25) In 2008, she discovered 
the insufficient withholding when she went to file her tax returns. (Tr. 26) In 2008, she 
decided that she could not afford to have money withheld from her paycheck for state 
taxes because she needed the money to make her car payment. (Tr. 22, 26) Since 
                                            
1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
2Unless stated otherwise, Applicant’s February 12, 2013 Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security clearance application (SF 86) is the source for the 
facts in this paragraph and the next paragraph. (GE 1)

2009, she had more funds withheld from her paycheck for her state and federal taxes. 
(Tr. 26) Applicant explained her state of mind for her financial decisions as follows: 
  
[T]his was just a situation just kind of just got out of hand. It was more like 
out of sight, out of mind, and I completely forgot about it, and it was almost 
like I wasn’t ready to deal with it. But now that I’m, like, forced to deal with 
it, you know, I’m really just trying to get everything reconciled and taken 
care of, so that’s all I have to say. (Tr. 23-24)  
 
Applicant is indebted to the state for a tax lien entered in 2010 for tax years 2007 
and 2008 in the approximate amount of $4,000. (Response to SOR ¶ 1.a) She is 
indebted to the state for a tax lien entered in 2011 for tax year 2009 in the approximate 
amount of $2,000. (Response to SOR ¶ 1.b)  
 
Applicant worked for the same employer from February 2007 to November 2012. 
(Tr. 25) She was unemployed from November 2012 to March 2013. (Tr. 35)  
 
Applicant thought she filed her state tax returns in 2010 and 2011; however, for 
some reason the state tax returns were not actually filed. (Tr. 37-38)3 She may have 
filed her other state tax returns at some point. (Tr. 38) In any event, Applicant filed her 
state tax returns for 2010 through 2014 in May 2015.4 She did not have any money 
withheld from her salary for her 2010 state taxes, and her 2010 state tax return shows 
she owed the state $1,967. After her hearing, she provided a 2010 state tax return 
showing she owed the state tax authority $1,827. (AE G at 10) Most of her 2011 state 
tax return submitted with her SOR response was blank. After her hearing, she provided 
another 2011 state tax return, which showed she owed the state tax authority $1,832. 
(AE G at 4) Her 2010 federal income tax return showed she was eligible for a $1,116 
refund. (AE G at 7), and her 2011 federal income tax return showed she was eligible for 
a $2,277 refund. (AE G at 16)   
 
For 2012, she did not have any money withheld from her salary for state taxes, 
and her tax return shows she owed the state $2,040.5 For 2013, her state tax return 
shows she owed the state $448, and her 2014 state tax return shows she owed the 
state $601. (SOR response) At the time of her hearing, she did not have a payment plan 
established to address her state tax debt.  
 
                                            
3Applicant’s SOR response includes state tax returns for 2010 through 2014. They are stamped 
on the first page, indicating they were received by the state tax authority in May 2015. Unless indicated 
otherwise, these documents are the sources for the information in this paragraph.   
 
4Applicant’s February 12, 2013 SF 86 indicates she answered, “No,” to the question “In the past 
seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or 
ordnance?”. (GE 1)   
 
5In June 2015, the state wrote Applicant indicating she owed $2,840 for tax year 2012, $565 for 
tax year 2013, and $612 for tax year 2014. (AE D, E, F) The amounts owed are greater than the amounts 
on her tax returns because the state added interest and penalties.

Applicant owes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $15,000, which was possibly 
for tax years 2008 through 2013 or 2014. (Tr. 27-28)6 She made several payments to 
the IRS. (Tr. 29) Then she stopped making payments to the IRS, and she is working 
with an IRS tax advocate to set up a new payment plan. It is unclear whether the 2010 
and 2011 federal income tax returns she provided after hearing were credited against 
her $15,000 IRS debt. 
 
In regard to her failure to timely file her state tax returns, Applicant said she 
recently learned that the state and federal taxing authorities were separate entities. (Tr. 
30-31) Previously she believed the IRS was collecting the state taxes too, and she did 
not understand that when she filed a state and federal tax return that they were being 
sent to two different entities. (Tr. 31-33, 35) Now that she knows they are separate 
debts she intends to work with the state to set up a payment plan. (Tr. 32, 51)  
 
After her hearing, Applicant provided a state tax form indicating she intended or 
had applied for a state tax amnesty. (AE G at 1) To qualify, she must pay all tax and 
one-half of interest owed between September 1, 2015, and October 30, 2015, or she 
must establish a qualifying payment plan.  (AE G at 18) If she qualifies for the amnesty 
plan, the state will forgive the civil penalties and one half of the interest owed on her 
taxes. (AE G at 18) 
 
Applicant said she did not believe she was responsible for the $466 medical 
collection debt in SOR ¶ 1.c. (Tr. 39-40; SOR response) She contacted the SOR ¶ 1.c 
creditor, and the creditor could not locate the debt. (Tr. 41-42) Applicant said she paid 
the $100 medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.d. (Tr. 40) Applicant has medical insurance. (Tr. 42) 
 
Applicant has not received financial counseling. (Tr. 43) She said she plans to 
pay her debts after ensuring that she is responsible for them. (Tr. 43-45) Three 
character statements from coworkers and friends indicate Applicant is kind, generous, 
loyal, responsible, caring, dedicated, honest, she learns from her mistakes and 
sincerely desires to correct her finances and pay her debts. (AE A-C) 
                                            
6Applicant’s SOR does not allege that she intentionally failed to provide accurate information 
about her taxes on her SF 86. See note 4, supra. Her SOR does not allege she failed to pay her federal 
income taxes as required. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board 
listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). Applicant’s failure to disclose her tax issues on her SF 86 and her failure to pay her 
federal income taxes as required will not be considered for any purpose, except in the whole-person 
discussion.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865. 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
I have not based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied 
determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an 
indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary 
of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts”; “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations”; and “(g) failure to file annual 
federal, state, or local income tax returns as required . . . .” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 
at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
Id. (internal citation omitted).  
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in her credit reports, hearing 
record, and SOR response. Applicant’s admitted that she has state tax debts for 2007, 
2008, and 2009, resulting in tax liens totaling about $6,000, and she failed to timely file 
her state tax returns for 2010 through 2012. The two collection accounts totaling $566 
are not established. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of 
mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;7 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
                                            
7The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

 Applicant’s conduct in resolving her delinquent debt does not establish full 
application of any mitigating conditions to her failure to timely file her state tax returns, 
and to pay her state tax debts. She was unemployed from November 2012 to March 
2013, which is a circumstance largely beyond her control. Applicant did not act 
responsibly under the circumstances. She presented insufficient evidence about what 
she has done since becoming employed over the last two years to address her state tax 
debt.  
 
 Applicant’s failure to prove that she has made more substantial steps to resolve 
her state and federal tax debts shows a lack of judgment and responsibility that weighs 
against approval or continuation of her security clearance. There is insufficient evidence 
that she was unable to make greater progress resolving her delinquent state and federal 
tax debts, or that her financial problems are being resolved, are under control, and will 
not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, she failed to establish that financial 
consideration concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to continue Applicant’s 
eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based 
upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have 
incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the 
factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional 
comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance. Applicant 
is a 29-year-old computer specialist, who has worked for defense contractors for about 
two years.  In 2003, she graduated from high school, and she has completed about 112 
quarter credits towards a bachelor’s of science degree in computer networking. She 
indicates that she plans to pay her tax debts. Three character statements from 
coworkers and friends describe Applicant as kind, generous, loyal, responsible, caring, 
dedicated, honest, and a person who learns from her mistakes and sincerely desires to

correct her finances and pay her debts. She currently holds a security clearance. There 
is no evidence of security violations or abuse of alcohol.    
The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more 
substantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial problems. She did not 
disclose her failure to file her state income tax returns on her February 12, 2013 SF 86. 
She is indebted to the state for a tax lien for tax years 2007 and 2008 in the 
approximate amount of $4,000, and she is indebted to the state for a tax lien for tax 
year 2009 in the approximate amount of $2,000. She did not timely file her 2010 through 
2013 state income tax returns. She owes more than $10,000 to the state for income 
taxes and about $10,000 to $15,000 to the IRS for income taxes. She has not 
established a payment plan to address her state and federal tax debts. Her failure to 
pay her taxes shows lack of financial responsibility and judgment and raises unmitigated 
questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified 
information. See AG ¶ 18.   
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial considerations concerns are 
not mitigated.   
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
