COACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concern. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 24, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. DOD CAF acted under Executive 
Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 
1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG). 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on November 14, 2014, and elected to have her 
case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted 
the Government’s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on February 27, 2015. The 
 
2 
 
 
evidence included in the FORM is identified as Items 1-7 and is admitted into the 
record. The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on May 29, 2015. Applicant 
was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation. She did not submit any information in response. The case 
was assigned to me on October 8, 2015.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the debts listed in the SOR 
(Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to withdraw ¶ 1.g; the motion is 
granted and that allegation is withdrawn). The admissions are adopted as findings of 
fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following 
additional findings of fact.1 
 
 Applicant is 44 years old. She has worked for a federal contractor since 2009. 
She is married with two adult children from a previous marriage. She has a high school 
diploma and has some technical training. She has no military experience, but held a 
security clearance when she worked for a different federal agency.2  
  
 The amended SOR lists nine delinquent debts totaling approximately $29,217. 
The debts include eight collection accounts, and one charged-off account. The debts 
are supported by a credit report from April 2015 and by Applicant’s statements to a 
defense investigator in May 2014.3 
 
 Applicant financial difficulties arose as a result of her husband losing his job of 20 
years in 2011. She has not received financial counseling. There is no evidence of a 
current budget or earnings and expense statement.4 
 
 The status of the debts is as follows: 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, 1.i (collection accounts for $72; $30; $60): 
 
 Applicant claims she paid these debts, but failed to supply any supporting 
documentation. These debts are unresolved.5 
 
 
 
                                                          
1 Item 4. 
 
2 Items 5, 7. 
 
3 Items 6-7. 
 
4 Items 5, 7. 
 
5 Item 4. 
 
 
3 
 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h (collection accounts for $154; $410; $571; $571; $381): 
 
 Applicant claims all these accounts were turned over to her insurance company 
for payment. No proof of payments or documentation from the insurance company was 
submitted. These debts are unresolved.6 
 
SOR ¶ 1.j (collection account for $26,968): 
 
 Applicant claimed she set up a payment plan to pay this debt, but she did not 
provide documentation supporting such a payment plan. This debt is unresolved.7 
  
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
                                                          
6 Item 4. 
 
7 Item 4. 
 
 
4 
 
 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
AG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have 
considered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: 
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
Applicant has delinquent debts that remain unpaid or unresolved. I find both the 
disqualifying conditions are raised.  
 
The guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns 
arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under 
AG ¶ 20 and the following potentially apply: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
 
5 
 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Applicant’s debts are recent and remain unresolved. She did not provide 
sufficient evidence to show that financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG ¶ 20(a) 
does not apply. Applicant presented evidence that some debts were due to 
circumstances beyond her control. For this mitigating condition to apply, she must also 
show responsible action toward resolving the debts. She failed to show proof of any 
action to resolve these debts or that she received any financial counseling. AG ¶¶ 20(b), 
20(c), 20(d) do not apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guideline and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the circumstances that 
led to Applicant’s financial problems. She failed to show a track record of financial 
stability.  
 
 
6 
 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, 
financial considerations. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
  
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.f:    Against Applicant 
 Subparagraph   1.g:     Withdrawn 
 Subparagraphs 1.h – 1.j:    Against Applicant 
  
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
