Decision 
__________ 
 
Harvey, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
In 2008, 2009, and 2012, Applicant was arrested for alcohol-related offenses. He 
has not had any incidents with police or the courts since 2012. He ended his alcohol 
consumption on August 1, 2012. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings to 
reinforce his abstinence. Alcohol consumption security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility 
for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 13, 2013, Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security clearance application (SF 86). 
(GE 1) On July 29, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 
1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines G (alcohol consumption) 
and J (criminal conduct). (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD 
could not make the affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with 
 
2 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
national security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) 
 
On September 2, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) On January 8, 
2015, Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On January 15, 2015, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. On March 
10, 2015, DOHA issued a notice of the hearing, setting the hearing for March 12, 2015. 
(HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. Applicant waived his right to 15 days of 
notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing. (Tr. 20-22) Department Counsel 
offered six exhibits into evidence, and Applicant did not offer any exhibits into evidence. 
(Tr. 32-34; GE 1-6) There were no objections, and I admitted all proffered exhibits into 
evidence. (Tr. 34; GE 1-6) On March 20, 2015, I received the transcript of the hearing.  
 
Procedural Issue 
 
Department Counsel moved to withdraw the allegations in SOR ¶ 2 and 2.a 
because the conduct is duplicated in SOR ¶ 1. (Tr. 18-19) There was no objection, and I 
granted Department Counsel’s motion. (Tr. 19)  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant admitted the conduct alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.c, 1.e, and 2.a. (HE 3) 
He also provided some extenuating and mitigating information. (HE 3) His admissions 
are accepted as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence 
of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.   
 
 Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor, who has worked in 
aviation testing and maintenance for defense contractors since 2010. (Tr. 6, 10; GE 1) 
He received his General Educational Development Diploma (GED) in 2001. (Tr. 6) He 
married in 2008, and he has two stepchildren, three children, and two nephews in his 
household. (Tr. 8-9) The seven children in his household are ages 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, 13, 
and 14. (Tr. 8) His spouse does not work outside their home. (Tr. 9) He is enrolled in 
college and is seeking a bachelor of science in aviation science. (Tr. 9)    
 
From 2003 to 2010, Applicant served in the Army; he left active duty as an E-4; 
his military occupational specialty (MOS) was 15D (aircraft power train repair and 
nondestructive inspector); and he received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 6-7) He was 
awarded the Army Good Conduct Medal and Army Achievement Medal. (Tr. 7) He 
served in Iraq from July 2003 to January 2004 and from October 2005 to September 
2006. (Tr. 7) The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has rated his Post Traumatic 
Stress Disorder (PTSD) at 30 percent. (Tr. 128-129)  
  
                                            
1The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses or 
locations in order to protect Applicant and his family’s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific 
information.

Alcohol Consumption 
 
 Applicant consumed alcohol at times to excess from the age of 16 to August 1, 
2012. (SOR ¶ 1.a) From 2008 to August 1, 2012, he occasionally consumed ¾ of a 
bottle of whiskey or 12 beers at a single setting. On March 10, 2008, Applicant went to a 
bar to check on his fiancée after consuming several drinks containing alcohol. (GE 2) 
He was in possession of a firearm. (GE 2) The bar called the police, and he was 
arrested and charged with public intoxication and unlawful carrying of a weapon. (SOR 
response ¶ 1.b; GE 2) The unlawful carrying of a weapon charge was dismissed 
because he had a permit to carry a firearm. (GE 2) He pleaded guilty to public 
intoxication and received fines and court costs of $250. (GE 2)   
 
On December 11, 2009, Applicant slid into a truck because the road was icy, and 
he was intoxicated. (GE 2) He was very close to his home, and decided to leave his 
vehicle and walk home. (GE 2) He was about 150 feet from the accident when he was 
arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), evading arrest, 
and leaving the scene of an accident. (SOR response ¶ 1.c; GE 2) He was convicted of 
DUI and leaving the scene of an accident. (GE 2) He was sentenced to 11 months and 
29 days in jail (suspended to three months of workhouse to be served on weekends), 
fines and court costs of $3,000, and revocation of his driver’s license for one year. (SOR 
response ¶ 1.c; GE 2) He was unable to reenlist because of the DUI. (Tr. 100) He could 
have reenlisted later after leaving active duty. (Tr. 101)  
 
On August 1, 2012, Applicant consumed alcohol to excess and was intoxicated; 
he punched his spouse in the head for no reason, and he was arrested for domestic 
assault. (Tr. 111-112; SOR ¶ 1.e; GE 2) He has very little memory of the incident. (GE 
2) He attended anger management classes. (GE 2) The judge told him that the charge 
would be dismissed if he did not have any problems for one year, and in September 
2013, the charge was dismissed. (GE 2)   
 
Alcohol counseling and treatment 
 
After his second Iraq deployment, but before his 2009 DUI, Applicant attempted 
to enroll in the Army’s Substance Abuse Program (ASAP). However, he was not 
permitted to enroll because his alcohol use was not of sufficient duration to justify 
enrollment. (Tr. 101-103) His alcohol consumption increased until he was becoming 
intoxicated three or four times a week. (Tr. 103) After his 2009 DUI, he was command- 
referred into ASAP, which consisted of outpatient group awareness and counseling 
once a week for 90 minutes for eight weeks. (Tr. 104-106) There is no evidence that he 
was diagnosed as alcohol dependent or as an alcohol abuser by a qualified medical 
professional or licensed clinical social worker.    
 
Applicant acknowledged that he is a recovering alcoholic. (Tr. 30, 125) He 
attended more than 100 AA meetings in the last 30 months. (Tr. 127-128) He used his 
AA meetings to reinforce his sobriety. (Tr. 124-125) He has earned a two-year-sobriety 
chip from AA; however, AA did not provide it to Applicant because his chapter was out 
of two-year chips. (Tr. 126) He understands that he will never be able to consume 
 
4 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
alcohol in the future. (Tr. 31,114) He has changed dramatically since August 1, 2012. 
(Tr. 120) He is a better husband, father, employee, and person because he ended his 
alcohol consumption. (Tr. 120-122) He expressed remorse for his alcohol-related 
misconduct. (Tr. 31) The following exchange occurred between Applicant and the 
Administrative Judge: 
 
Administrative Judge: So, you are making a commitment to—to us today that you 
are not going to consume any alcohol at all? Is that right? 
 
Applicant: I make a commitment to you. I will make a commitment to myself. I will 
make a commitment to my family. I will make a commitment to my Lord. I am not 
going back down that road. (Tr. 131)    
 
Character evidence 
 
 Applicant’s AA sponsor has known him since August 2012. (Tr. 40) Applicant 
changed significantly as he progressed through AA, becoming more humble and 
accepting personal responsibility for his shortcomings and misbehavior. (Tr. 39-41, 45-
46) He is honest and generous. (Tr. 48) He has learned from his mistakes. (Tr. 49) He 
frequently attends AA meetings. (Tr. 41) There were no indications whatsoever that he 
had resumed his alcohol consumption after August 1, 2012. (Tr. 46-47)  
 
 Several friends, his supervisor, and two coworkers described Applicant as 
dedicated to his family, reliable, law abiding and abstinent from alcohol consumption 
after his arrest on August 1, 2012. (Tr. 52-98) He takes responsibility for his conduct, 
and he is sincere, trustworthy, diligent, and professional. (Tr. 52-98) Applicant was open 
and honest about his history of alcohol consumption. (Tr. 52-98) 
 
Policies 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, 
emphasizing that, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy 
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon meeting the criteria 
contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
 
5 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Adverse 
clearance decisions are made “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the [a]pplicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Nothing in this decision 
should be construed to suggest that I based this decision, in whole or in part, on any 
express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the 
Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
 Alcohol Consumption 
 
 AG ¶ 21 articulates the Government’s concern about alcohol consumption, 
“[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment 
or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual’s reliability 
and trustworthiness.” 
   
 
6 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
  Seven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security or 
trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG ¶¶ 22(a) - 22(g) 
provide:   
 
(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under 
the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or 
other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is 
diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in 
an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of 
whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol 
dependent; 
 
(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired 
judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol 
abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, 
clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol 
dependence; 
 
(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed 
clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol 
treatment program; 
 
(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion 
of an alcohol rehabilitation program; and 
 
(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, 
evaluation, treatment, or abstinence. 
 
AG ¶¶ 22(b) and 22(d) to 22(g) do not apply. Applicant did not have any alcohol-
related incidents at work, did not violate any court orders, and did not have a diagnosis 
of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence.   
 
AG ¶ 22(a) applies because his excessive alcohol consumption resulted in 
arrests in 2008, 2009, and 2012. Two of his arrests resulted in convictions, and various 
penalties imposed by the courts. AG ¶ 22(c) applies because he engaged in binge 
alcohol consumption.2  
                                            
2Although the term “binge” drinking is not defined in the Directive, the generally accepted 
definition of binge drinking for males is the consumption of five or more drinks in about two hours.
 
The 
definition of binge drinking was approved by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 
(NIAAA) National Advisory Council in February 2004. See U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 
NIAAA Newsletter 3 (Winter 2004 No. 3), http://www.pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Newsletter/ 
winter2004/NewsletterNumber3.pdf.

  Four Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 23(a)-23(d) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or 
does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment; 
 
(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol 
abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and 
has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or 
responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); 
 
(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling 
or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, 
and is making satisfactory progress; and 
 
(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient 
counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has 
demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or 
abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as 
participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar 
organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified 
medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff 
member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. 
 
AG ¶ 23(a) to 23(d) apply. Applicant completed some alcohol-use classes or 
outpatient therapy after his 2009 DUI. However, it was not sufficient to convince him to 
end his alcohol consumption. He has not attended any intensive, inpatient alcohol 
rehabilitation or counseling programs.  
 
Security clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, 
because the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show 
many different permutations. The DOHA Appeal Board has determined in cases of 
substantial alcohol abuse that AG ¶ 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless 
there was a fairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption. See ISCR 
Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 
(App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).  For 
example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board 
reversed the administrative judge’s grant of a clearance and noted, “That Applicant 
continued to drink even after his second alcohol related arrest vitiates the Judge’s 
application of MC 3.”   
 
In ISCR Case No. 05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board 
reversed an administrative judge’s grant of a clearance to an applicant (AB) where AB 
had several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB’s most recent DUI was in 
2000, six years before an administrative judge decided AB’s case. AB had reduced his 
 
8 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
alcohol consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol 
(not to intoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB’s continued 
alcohol consumption was not responsible, and the grant of AB’s clearance was arbitrary 
and capricious. See also ISCR Case No. 04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) 
(involving case with most recent alcohol-related incident three years before hearing, and 
reversing administrative judge’s grant of a clearance). 
 
In August 2012, Applicant started attending AA meetings. He has changed and 
no longer consumes alcohol. He abstains from alcohol consumption, which is the basis 
for all alcohol-related security concerns. Enough time has elapsed without alcohol-
related problems to fully establish his alcohol consumption is under control, and his 
alcohol consumption no longer casts doubt on Applicant’s “current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.” After careful consideration of the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence on alcohol consumption, I conclude his extensive AA involvement and his 
abstinence from alcohol consumption since August 1, 2012, are sufficient to resolve my 
doubts about Applicant’s alcohol consumption and to mitigate security concerns under 
Guideline G.      
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. My comments under 
Guideline G are incorporated into my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG 
¶ 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting denial of Applicant’s access to classified 
information. Applicant had alcohol-related arrests in 2008, 2009, and 2012. He had two 
alcohol-related convictions resulting from his conduct in 2008 and 2009. He described 
frequent episodes of binge-alcohol consumption from 2008 to 2012. 
 
The evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance is more substantial 
than the evidence supporting denial. Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense

contractor, who has worked in aviation testing and maintenance for defense contractors 
since 2010. From 2003 to 2010, he served in the Army; he left active duty as an E-4; 
and he received an honorable discharge. He served in Iraq from July 2003 to January 
2004 and from October 2005 to September 2006. The VA has rated his PTSD at 30 
percent. There is no evidence at his current employment of any disciplinary problems. 
Applicant changed significantly as he progressed through AA. He accepted personal 
responsibility for his shortcomings and misbehavior. He is honest and generous and has 
learned from his mistakes.    
 
Several friends, his supervisor, and two coworkers described Applicant as 
dedicated to his family, reliable, law abiding and abstinent from alcohol consumption 
after his arrest on August 1, 2012. He takes responsibility for his conduct. He is sincere, 
trustworthy, diligent, and professional. There is no evidence of security violations, 
disloyalty, or that he would intentionally violate national security. He has not consumed 
alcohol since August 1, 2012. His alcohol abstinence for 30 months and commitment 
not to consume alcohol in the future show Applicant’s current reliability, trustworthiness, 
and good judgment. 
  
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude approval of Applicant’s 
access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security.    
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline G:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.f:   For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline J:     WITHDRAWN 
 
Subparagraph 2.a:    Withdrawn 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national security to approve Applicant’s security clearance.  
Eligibility for access to classified information is approved.
