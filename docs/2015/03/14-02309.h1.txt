DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 28, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD CAF could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. On September 11, 2014,

Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. This case was assigned to me 
on November 5, 2014. On November 24, 2014, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling the hearing for December 11, 
2014. The hearing was held as scheduled.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 
through 8, while Applicant testified, called a witness to testify in her behalf, and offered 
Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through I. The record of the hearing was held open until 
January 8, 2015, to provide the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional 
documents. She submitted documents that were marked as AE J through AA. All 
proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. The transcript (Tr.) of 
the hearing was received on December 23, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old security clerk who works for a federal contractor. She 
has worked for that company since June 2013.  She graduated from high school in 1987 
and attended college for almost two years. She is divorced and has no children. She 
has held a security clearance for about 12 years without incident.1 
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2005, 
which resulted in a discharge of debts in December 2005 (SOR ¶ 1.a), that she filed 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy in September 2010, which was dismissed in December 2011 
(SOR ¶ 1.b), and that she filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in May 2012, which was 
dismissed in December 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.c). In her Answer to the SOR, she admitted the 
allegations with explanations. Her admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.2 
 
In about 1992, Applicant began supporting her ailing mother. She estimated that 
she provided her mother about $400 to $450 per month in support. In April 2000, 
Applicant purchased a home solely in her name. In February 2002, she was laid off from 
a job that she had held for three years. While unemployed, she used her savings to pay 
the mortgage and other bills. She remained unemployed for about 12 weeks before 
obtaining a job in which she earned about $33,000. She had difficulty keeping up with 
her home expenses such as repairs to the roof and air conditioning unit. In January 
2005, she sold her home, but did not make enough money from the sale to pay all of 
her debts. She did not qualify for a consolidation loan from a bank. She tried to obtain a 
loan from her ailing father; however, he declined to assist her and advised her to file 
bankruptcy. She indicated that she was young and followed her father’s advice. In 
September 2005, Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Her bankruptcy petition listed 
$16,025 in assets and $41,091 in liabilities. In December 2005, she was granted a

Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. After the bankruptcy, her financial situation remained 
stable for a number of years.3 
 
After her mother passed away in February 2009, Applicant was burdened with 
debts from supporting her mother as well as burial expenses. She again fell behind on 
her debts. In September 2010, she filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Her bankruptcy petition 
listed $9,904 in assets and $22,947 in liabilities. The Chapter 13 plan initially called for 
her to pay the trustee $500 per month with those payments increasing to $550 for the 
last 56 months of the plan. In September 2011, she married, left her job in which she 
was earning about $59,000 annually, and moved to another state to live with her 
husband.4 
 
In October 2011, Applicant’s Chapter 13 plan was modified to permit her to 
suspend making payments for September, October, and November 2011; from that 
point her monthly payments increased to $613; and she was placed in a six-month 
probationary status. If she failed to make a monthly payment during the probationary 
period, the trustee could obtain an order dismissing the bankruptcy without further 
notice. She had difficulty finding a job in the new state. She first worked as a sales 
associate in a retail store and then as an officer manager for a healthcare provider. She 
earned considerably less than the job she had before moving to the new state. She 
described her marriage as “horribly bad,” indicating that her husband had a bad temper. 
He refused to help her with her debts. In January 2012, she separated from her 
husband and moved back to her former state. She again had difficulty in finding 
employment upon returning, but eventually obtained a job in March 2012. In May 2012, 
the bankruptcy was dismissed when Applicant missed the April 2012 payment.5 
 
Based on her attorney’s advice, Applicant immediately refiled Chapter 13 
bankruptcy in May 2012. In this bankruptcy petition, she listed $8,238 in assets and 
$34,084 in liabilities. Her bankruptcy petition indicated that she would start a security 
clerk job in June 2012. The petition listed that her net monthly income was $2,063 and 
her monthly expenses were $1,763, which left her a net monthly remainder of $300. Her 
Chapter 13 plan provided that she would pay the trustee $300 per month. In June 2012, 
she was divorced and was saddled with some of bills from the marriage, including a 
furniture debt that her ex-husband had initially agreed to pay but failed to do so. He also 
refused to return the furniture. She sold all of her property to pay debts and continued to 
struggle financially. In October 2012, she was again placed in a six-month bankruptcy 
probationary status and her monthly payments were increased to $320 for the 
remaining 55 months of the plan. In December 2012, the Chapter 13 bankruptcy was 
dismissed.6

In June 2013, Applicant obtained a new job with an annual salary of about 
$49,000. She moved to another city for that job.  Shortly after arriving in the new city, 
her car was repossessed, and the creditor sought to collect a $5,000 loan deficiency. In 
October 2013, she filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Her latest bankruptcy petition listed 
$11,081 in assets and $58,935 in liabilities. Her net monthly income and monthly 
expenses were both listed as $2,585. All of the debts from the prior Chapter 13 
bankruptcies were included in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In February 2014, she was 
granted a bankruptcy discharge. She testified that she has incurred no new delinquent 
debts since her bankruptcy discharge.7 
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel noted that Applicant reported in her latest 
bankruptcy petition that she owed past-due federal and state taxes, which are not 
usually discharged in a bankruptcy. The bankruptcy petition admitted into evidence did 
not contain a Schedule E, the list of creditors holding unsecured priority claims, which 
usually lists past-due taxes. She testified that she thought those taxes were resolved 
through the withholding of her income tax refunds. In her post hearing submission, she 
provided the Schedule E that reflected she owed $731 in state taxes and $3,108 in 
federal taxes. She also presented documentation showing that her outstanding federal 
tax obligation has been reduced to $1,218 and her state tax obligation has been 
reduced to $406. She stated that she entered into repayment agreement with the 
Internal Revenue Service in which payments will be automatically withdrawn from her 
checking account, but provided no documentation confirming that arrangement. 
Additionally, she stated that the state taxing authority does not enter into repayment 
agreements, but she would make monthly payments to resolve that debt.8 
 
Applicant received financial counseling to file bankruptcy. In her post-hearing 
submission, she presented a Personal Financial Statement that reflected she had a net 
monthly income of $3,100, total monthly expenses of $1,759, and total monthly debt 
payments of $777, which left her a net monthly remainder of $564. Applicant also 
presented a letter showing that she was offered a security job with a new employer in 
which she will earn $53,000 annually. She was planning to start that new job in 
February 2015.9 
 
Applicant’s supervisor testified that Applicant is a trustworthy individual and 
valued employee. Applicant presented letters of reference from friends and coworkers 
attesting to her dedication and good nature. She received a certificate of excellence for 
her outstanding work performance in 2014. Her work contributions were also recognized 
during a 2014 Defense Security Service vulnerability assessment of her company’s

security program. Her performance appraisal for 2014 graded her as “4” (exceeds 
expectations) on a scale ranging from 1 to 5.10 
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, to reach his decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v.

Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant filed bankruptcy petitions in 2005, 2010, 2012, and 2013. She received 
bankruptcy discharges in 2005 and 2014. This evidence is sufficient to raise the above 
disqualifying conditions. 
 
  Four mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
 
7 
 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.  
 
 From 1992 to 2009, Applicant supported her ailing mother. She was unemployed 
from February to April 2002 and encountered financial problems in maintaining a home. 
In 2005, she filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy and received a discharge of her debts. In 2009, 
her mother passed away and she was burdened with the burial expenses. She married 
in 2011, left her job, and moved to another state to reside with her husband. Her 
marriage failed. She returned to her home state and had difficulty finding a well-paying 
job. In 2012, she was divorced. Her mother’s medical problems as well as her 
unemployment, divorce, and underemployment were conditions beyond her control that 
contributed to her financial problems. She twice tried to resolve her delinquent debts 
through Chapter 13 bankruptcies, but those efforts were unsuccessful. In October 2013, 
she filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy and received a discharge of her debts. Her decision to 
file Chapter 7 bankruptcy was not unreasonable under the circumstances. She has 
taken steps to resolve the remaining relatively small past-due tax debts. Her financial 
problems are under control, are being resolved, and are unlikely to recur. She is 
financially stable. AG ¶¶ 20(b) and 20(c) apply. AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies. AG ¶ 20(d) 
does not apply.  
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
8 
 
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).  
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a valued employee. Her supervisor testified that she is trustworthy. 
She encountered financial difficulties beyond her control, but resolved those problems 
through bankruptcy proceedings. She is now financially stable. Overall, the record 
evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and 
suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.    
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   For Applicant 
 
   Subparagraphs1.a-1.c:  For Applicant 
    
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is granted.
