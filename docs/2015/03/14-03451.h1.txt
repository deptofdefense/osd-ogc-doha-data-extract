RICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the Government’s security concerns under Guideline 
F, financial considerations. Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 2, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
 On October 21, 2014, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 5, 2015. The 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on 
February 18, 2015. I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 9, 2015. The 
 
2 
 
 
Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5. GE 1, 2, 4, and 5 were admitted into 
evidence without objection. Applicant objected to GE 3, the summary of her personal 
subject interview. Her objection was sustained and GE 3 was not admitted. Applicant 
testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were admitted into 
evidence without objection. The record was held open until March 20, 2015, to allow 
Applicant to submit additional documents, which she did. They were marked as AE D 
through I, and they were admitted into evidence without objection.1 DOHA received the 
hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 13, 2015.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant failed to admit or deny the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, except to 
provide explanations. Therefore, I will treat the allegations as if she denied them. She 
admitted the remaining allegations in the SOR. I have incorporated her admissions into 
the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is 51 years old. She was married from 2002 until December 2010. She 
has one child age 19. She served in the Air Force from 1983 to 1989 and was honorably 
discharged. She earned an associate’s degree in 1989, and a second one in 1995. She 
has been employed with his present employer, a federal contractor, since 2003 and she 
has held a security clearance since then.2 
 
Credit reports support Applicant owed the debts alleged in the SOR. In October 
2010, Applicant consulted an attorney about filing bankruptcy. She stated she paid the 
required fee to initiate the bankruptcy but was struggling with whether it was a good 
idea to pursue it. She attended the mandatory credit counseling, but did not file 
bankruptcy until October 2014, after receiving the SOR. She believes all of the debts in 
the SOR were discharged in bankruptcy on January 30, 2015. The delinquent debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.cc, excluding ¶ 1.u, total approximately $61,333. Applicant’s 
Summary of Schedules reflects $89,451 in unsecured nonpriority claims that were 
discharged. A $23,969 delinquent student loan (SOR ¶ 1.u) and a state income tax debt 
of $5,000 were not discharged. Her delinquent debts date from at least 2007.3  
 
Applicant attributed her financial problems to her marriage. She testified she 
purchased two houses without financial assistance from her husband. She stated she 
became aware her husband had a gambling problem in 2002. He would not contribute 
financially to the household. She began having financial problems in 2004. She 
purchased a house in her name in 2004. He husband was unable to contribute 
financially because he had bad credit. He wanted his name on the deed of a house, so 
she purchased another house in 2006. She used equity in the first house to buy the

second house and also to pay his delinquent bills. One home was used as a rental 
property, and she experienced financial difficulties when the tenants did not pay their 
rent. Both houses were foreclosed in 2010. The 2006 house was sold and there was no 
deficiency. SOR ¶ 1.w ($21,995) was the equity loan for the 2004 house.4   
 
Applicant testified that she obtained the student loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.u 
($23,969) in 1993 and consolidated it with others in 2005. She stated she began making 
payments on it six months after she graduated and stopped paying it when she was 
unemployed or underemployed. She stated she contacted the creditor to have the loan 
placed in a hardship status. She indicated that in the past 14 years she has made 
payments on the loan and had only missed three payments before it was placed in 
default status. She did not provide documents to show she had been making payments 
in the past or the current balance owed. She stated she paid $500 a month from 
December 2012 to May 2013 to rehabilitate the loan, but did not provide documents to 
support these payments. After the hearing, she provided documents to show her 
student loan is in forbearance and payments will begin in the next 10 to 40 days. She 
was not yet provided with the monthly payment amount but was confident she could pay 
it.5 
 
Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns for tax years 2009, 
2010, 2011, and 2012. She and her husband lived together until January 2010. They 
filed their tax returns separately and used different tax preparers. In 2010, Applicant 
agreed to have her husband’s tax preparer complete her tax returns for tax year 2009. 
She believed he had filed her 2009 tax return. At some point, she contacted the 
preparer and learned he filed an extension, but did not file the return. She stated she 
was told she owed him money for the preparation. She did not have the money to pay 
him. She indicated she was aware she likely owed about $3,000 for tax year 2009. She 
stated: “I didn’t file in 2010, 2011, and 2012 on time because I knew that I owed for 
2009. And I wanted to pay that first. But after the fact I realized that wasn’t the right 
thing to do.”6  
 
Applicant testified that for tax years 2010, 2011 and 2012 she believed she would 
be getting a refund so she was not in a hurry to file them. She indicated that she did not 
believe there was a problem if she did not owe money. She indicated she had increased 
her withholdings so she would receive a refund. She filed her 2009 federal income tax 
return on June 17, 2013; tax year 2010 was filed on May 6, 2013; tax year 2011 was 
filed on May 13, 2013; and tax year 2012 was filed on May 27, 2013. It does not appear 
Applicant owes any outstanding federal taxes.7

Applicant disclosed on her security clearance application (SCA), in March 2013 
that she failed to file her 2009 federal tax returns, but anticipated refunds for 2010, 
2011, and 2012. She did not disclose her failure to timely file federal income tax returns 
for 2010, 2011, and 2012. She disclosed in the SCA that she and her husband were 
going to file jointly for tax year 2009 and they would not receive a refund. She stated 
“Just recently I was going thr[ough] my papers to account for past files and when I didn’t 
see 2009.” She disclosed she then learned the 2009 tax returns were not filed. She 
indicated when her husband moved out of the house in 2010 he took their files, and she 
trusted him that the 2009 tax returns were filed. She further noted in the SCA that after 
discovering the 2009 tax returns were not filed, she contacted the Internal Revenue 
Service to verify the 2009 tax returns were not filed. She stated that she was told that 
since she was receiving a refund for 2010 and 2011 that the amount would be applied 
to what she owed.8  
 
Applicant’s bankruptcy documents reflect she owes state income taxes for 2010, 
2011, and 2012. Applicant testified that she believed she owed approximately $3,300 
for state income taxes from tax years 2010 and 2012. Documents provided after the 
hearing support the balance owed is $3,422. She stated that she thought her federal 
and state income tax returns were filed together, so she was unaware until 2013 that 
she owed state income tax. She is attempting to negotiate a payment plan for the state 
taxes. She anticipated a federal income tax refund of about $4,000 for 2014 that she 
would use to pay her delinquent state income taxes.9 
 
Applicant indicated she has a budget and has about $1,000 remaining at the end 
of the month. She did not provide a personal financial statement. She has been 
voluntarily off work to care for her mother for two months. She received an “incentive 
check” of $2,000 from her employer and has used that to pay bills. She did not pay her 
rent for August, September, and October 2014, because she was caring for her mother 
and sister. She stated she made arrangements with the landlord to pay what she is 
able. She now lives with her aunt. She earned approximately $70,000 in 2014. She 
helps care for her disabled sister and her mother. She does not have any savings. She 
withdrew money from her employer’s pension plan.10

9 Tr. 94-103; AE D, E, F. I have not considered Applicant’s failure to file and pay her state income taxes 
for disqualifying purposes, but will consider it as permitted. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may 
be considered. They are: (a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has 
demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence of the whole-person analysis under Directive 6.3.

 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.” 
  
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:  
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have 
considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19, and the following three are 
potentially applicable: 
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required or the fraudulent filing of the same. 
 
Applicant had $89,451 of debt discharged in bankruptcy in January 2015. She 
failed to timely file her 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 federal income taxes. I find there is 
sufficient evidence to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  
 
The guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns 
arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
 
7 
 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
Applicant attributed her financial problems to her divorce and husband’s 
gambling. Her delinquent debts date from at least 2007. She recently resolved most of 
her delinquent debts in January 2015 through Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Her student loan is 
in forbearance and she expects payments to be due soon. Although she attributed her 
problems to her husband, she failed to take action on any of her delinquent debts after 
her 2010 divorce until they were discharged in bankruptcy in 2015. She failed to timely 
file her federal income tax returns for 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Her explanation for 
her failure to follow through on the 2009 tax return may have some credibility due to her 
divorce, but she testified she was aware of the problem when the preparer demanded 
payment. Although she may have had an extension, she never followed through to 
ensure it was filed. She did not have a reasonable explanation for failing to timely file 
returns in subsequent years. She was aware she owed federal taxes for 2009. Believing 
she would receive a refund in 2010, 2011 and 2012 does not absolve her of her 
responsibility to file these returns on time. In 2013 when she filed her tax returns, 
refunds were applied to the owed amount for 2009. AG ¶ 20(a) is not established 
because she only recently had her debts discharged through bankruptcy. In addition, 
she does not have a track record to show she is handling her finances responsibly. 
Therefore, I cannot conclude that financial instability is unlikely to recur. Her repeated 
failure to timely file her federal income tax returns cast doubt on her current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment.  
 
Applicant was aware her husband was gambling and not contributing financially 
to the household. Despite this knowledge she agreed in 2006 to purchase a second 
house so he could have his name on the deed. She took out an equity loan to purchase 
the second house. That loan was not repaid. Her husband’s gambling was beyond her 
control. She relied on her husband’s friend to prepare and file her federal income tax 
returns for 2009. Following through with filing her tax returns was within her control. Her 
willingness to take on new debt knowing her husband was irresponsible was within her 
control. For the full application of AG ¶ 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly 
under the circumstances. She completed paperwork to file bankruptcy in 2010, but did 
not proceed with it until late 2014. She became aware that her 2009 federal income tax 
returns were not timely filed when the preparer demanded payment. Despite the 
extension, she did not take appropriate action to ensure she had complied with filing for 
2009. She did not have a reasonable explanation for her failure to timely file for tax 
years 2010, 2011, and 2012. AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies.  
 
Applicant’s discharge of $89,451 of delinquent debt in 2015 does not constitute a 
good-faith effort to resolve her delinquent debts. She testified that she was making 
payments on her student loans and only missed three payments when the debt went 
into default status. She provided evidence the student loans are now in a forbearance 
status and will be due in the next 10 to 40 days. She did not provide documentary 
evidence of her past loan payments and when the loan was placed in forbearance and 
removed from default status. She also has delinquent state income taxes. She failed to 
 
8 
 
 
provide a reasonable explanation as to why she failed to pay her state income taxes. 
Applicant has not established a track record to show she is acting financially 
responsibly. Applicant has not presented sufficient evidence to conclude there are clear 
indications her financial problems are under control and resolved. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 
20(d) do not apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is 51 years old. She earned two associate degrees and served 
honorably in the armed forces. She helps care for her disabled sister and her mother. 
She experienced financial problems due to her husband’s gambling and a divorce. She 
did not address her delinquent debts until she filed bankruptcy in late 2014, and her 
delinquent debts were discharged in January 2015. Applicant failed to timely file her 
2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 federal income tax returns. Although the circumstances 
surrounding the filing of her 2009 return may not have been entirely her fault, she was 
aware that there was a problem, but failed to follow through on resolving it. She was 
aware she owed approximately $3,000 for her 2009 taxes. Although she may have 
believed she would get a refund in subsequent years she had no way of knowing if it 
would cover the 2009 taxes until she actually filed. After her bankruptcy she had a clean 
financial slate, except that she still has not resolved her state income tax debt and her 
student loan payments are about to be due. She has not established a track record of 
financial responsibility and has not met her burden of persuasion. Overall the record 
evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and suitability 
 
9 
 
 
for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the 
security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.cc:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
