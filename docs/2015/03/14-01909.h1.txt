GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations and 
personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information 
is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 20, 2014, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On July 17, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility – Division A (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the DOD on September

1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and 
E (Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators could not make 
an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 3, 2014. In a sworn 
statement, dated August 14, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On November 13, 2014, 
Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was 
assigned to me on November 17, 2014. A Notice of Hearing was issued on December 
1, 2014. I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on December 16, 2014. 
 
 During the hearing, five Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 5) and nine 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE I) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on January 5, 2015. I 
kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of 
that opportunity. He submitted additional documents which were marked as AE J 
through AE L and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on 
December 24, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted six of the factual allegations in the 
SOR under financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a., 1.b., and 1.d. through 1.g.) as well as the 
factual allegation pertaining to personal conduct (¶ 2.a.). Applicant’s admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as a tool/part attendant since August 2005.2 He was briefly unemployed from 
July 2005 until August 2005.3 Applicant served in an enlisted capacity with the U.S. 
Navy on active duty from September 1973 until October 1993.4 He retired with an 
honorable discharge and was transferred to the Fleet Reserve.5 He received a General 
Educational Development (GED) diploma in 1975 while deployed at sea,6 and took

some subsequent college courses.7 Applicant was granted a secret security clearance 
in 1981 while on active duty,8 but that clearance apparently expired, for Applicant does 
not currently hold a security clearance.9 Applicant was married in 1975.10 He and his 
wife have two children: a son born in 1974 and a daughter born in 1976.11  
 
Military Service 
 
 During his military service, Applicant was awarded the Navy Commendation 
Medal, the Navy Achievement Medal, the Meritorious Unit Commendation (with one 
device), the National Defense Service Medal (with one device), the Sea Service 
Deployment Ribbon (with two devices), the Navy and Marine Corps Overseas Service 
Ribbon (with two devices), and the Good Conduct Medal (with four devices).12 
 
Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct 
Applicant was one of ten children, and although his father was retired from the 
U.S. Army, the family was very poor. Applicant started working when he was 11 years 
old, and he enlisted in the U.S. Navy when he was 17 years old. There was nothing 
unusual about Applicant’s finances until 1992.  
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): Because he was brought up poor, Applicant was very naïve about 
financial matters, never having had financial counseling or guidance. In his younger 
years, he never had anything, but later on, if he saw something he wanted, he would 
use a credit card to purchase it. He never realized the consequences of purchasing 
something he could not afford. As a result, he became overextended financially and was 
unable to continue paying his mounting bills.13 In June 1992, Applicant and his wife 
voluntarily jointly filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.14 
The specific nature of the accounts (i.e., credit cards, vehicles, mortgages, retail 
accounts, lines of credit, etc.) was not furnished. In October 1992, their unsecured 
nonpriority debts, worth an unspecified amount, were discharged.15 Applicant’s 
delinquent accounts were eliminated, and he was given a renewed fresh start 
financially.

(SOR ¶ 1.d.): Applicant’s financial situation during the early years following the 
discharge of his debts is unclear. Unfortunately, his irresponsible spending habits 
eventually returned. As a result, he again became overextended financially and was 
unable to continue paying his mounting bills.16 In June 2001, Applicant and his wife 
again voluntarily jointly filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code.17 The specific nature of the accounts was not furnished. In October 2001, their 
unsecured nonpriority debts, worth an unspecified amount, were discharged.18 
Nevertheless, Applicant did reaffirm three of the debts.19 With the exception of the 
reaffirmed debts, Applicant’s delinquent accounts were eliminated, and he was again 
given a renewed fresh start financially. 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): Applicant contends that for a number of years following his 2001 
bankruptcy discharge he was “doing excellent” financially.20 In September 2004, things 
changed dramatically when Hurricane Ivan, a Category 3 hurricane with 120 mph winds 
made landfall on the U.S. mainland, causing extensive damage to the entire area. At the 
time, Applicant was temporarily saving money by residing with his son, while his 
permanent home, which was serving as a rental property, was damaged. The house 
was repainted; the air conditioner was repaired; the roof was repaired; and siding was 
repaired. Applicant’s insurance was insufficient to cover all of the repairs, and he had to 
pay the repair costs using out-of-pocket funds.21 At the time, Applicant was earning $9 
per hour.22 
In July 2005, less than a year after Hurricane Ivan struck the area, Hurricane 
Dennis, another Category 3 hurricane with 125 mph winds made landfall on the U.S. 
mainland, also causing extensive damage to his permanent residence in which he was 
now residing, as well as the entire area. The insurance did not cover flooding damage to 
his den or the roof damage. Applicant’s nephew repaired the roof, and Applicant’s son 
helped him with other repairs. The expenses put an extensive strain on Applicant’s 
ability to maintain his accounts current.23 At the time, Applicant was earning $16 per 
hour.24 Unbeknownst to Applicant, both hurricanes enabled termites to infest his 
residence. When he learned of the infestation, he used the rest of his savings ($1,800) 
to seek professional help in treating the problem. Unfortunately for Applicant, several

months later, a portion of the ceiling collapsed. While attempting to make repairs, the 
wood in the rafters crumbled due to termite rot.25 At that point, without funds to make 
additional repairs, Applicant simply “gave up.”26  
In December 2009, Applicant and his wife again voluntarily and jointly filed for 
bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.27 Applicant listed 
$182,679.07 in liabilities, with 9 creditors holding secured claims worth $96,678, and 88 
creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims, totaling $86,001.07. In April 2010, their 
unsecured nonpriority debts were discharged.28 Among the discharged accounts were 
mortgages, credit card accounts, bank loans, insurance accounts, and automobile 
loans.29 Applicant’s delinquent accounts were eliminated, and he was again given a 
renewed fresh start financially. 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): At the times Applicant filed his federal income tax returns for the 
tax years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, he failed to make any of the tax payments 
associated with those respective tax returns. He owed the following approximate 
amounts for the designated years: $2,700 (2008), $2,800 (2009), $2,800 (2010), $1,300 
(2011), and $3,000 (2012), totaling $12,600.30 Applicant acknowledged that he owed 
the taxes, but he was in no position to pay them because his financial assets were 
exhausted and he simply did not have sufficient funds to pay his routine bills and his 
taxes.31 Furthermore, during their 39 years of marriage, Applicant’s wife worked outside 
the home for only four months, and that occurred in 1978.32  
 
After several unsuccessful attempts to contact the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS), in early 2013, the IRS and Applicant agreed to an installment agreement under 
which Applicant would pay approximately $200 per month. He made an unspecified 
number of payments, but suddenly stopped when his wife’s health deteriorated.33 
Without insurance to cover her necessary surgeries, Applicant withdrew $8,000 from his 
401(k) to pay for them. He also withdrew an additional $2,000 to pay other bills.34

In August 2014, Applicant engaged the professional services of an attorney to 
represent him with respect to his federal income tax liability. He paid the attorney at 
least $362.50 for the service.35 Applicant entered into a 72-month installment 
agreement, commencing in November 2014.36 The terms of the installment agreement, 
covering the tax years 2008 through 2013, initially called for a payment of $220 per 
month,37 but because a creditor filed a Form 1099, the monthly payment is expected to 
increase to $235 per month.38 Applicant’s documentation reflects monthly payments of 
$220 in October 2014, November 2014, and December 2014.39 Applicant also pays a 
monthly “convenience fee” of either $2.49 or $2.79 for making the payments through an 
authorized payment service.40 In order to reduce his eventual end-of-the-year income 
tax burden, Applicant maximized his monthly withholding.41 Applicant’s federal income 
tax liability for the tax years 2008 through 2012 is in the process of being resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): In addition to the professional services of his attorney representing 
him with respect to his federal income tax liability for those past tax years, the attorney 
assisted him in filing his federal income tax return for tax year 2013. That tax return has 
been filed,42 and any tax liability for that particular tax year is in the process of being 
resolved. 
 
The SOR also identified two purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by 
credit reports from January 201443 and October 2014,44 totaling approximately $10,766. 
Those debts listed in the SOR and their respective current status, according to the 
credit reports, other evidence in the case file, and Applicant’s admissions regarding the 
same, are described below. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): There is an automobile loan account with a high credit of $24,540, a 
balance of $22,986, and a past-due balance of $1,051 that was placed for collection.45 
When he purchased the used vehicle in June 2012, Applicant agreed to make monthly

payments of $546.46 He made his required monthly payments for several months, but in 
September 2013, he started falling behind in his payments. When he had fallen behind 
for three straight months, the creditor contacted him. Applicant contended he made 
larger-than-required payments starting in January 2014 to bring the account current, but 
by September 2014, the past-due balance had risen to $1,638.47 In November 2014, the 
vehicle was involuntarily repossessed from Applicant.48 He attempted to contact the 
creditor to resolve the issue, but he has not yet received any information or documents 
confirming either the repossession or the issue of any continuing financial liability.49 The 
account has not been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): There is another automobile loan account with a high credit of 
$10,266 and a past-due balance of $9,715 that was placed for collection and charged 
off in December 2013.50 When he purchased the used vehicle in September 2010, he 
traded in a truck. He made his required monthly payments of approximately $500 for 
several months, but in May 2012, he started falling behind in his payments.51 The 
vehicle was repossessed that same year.52 At some point in 2013, Applicant and the 
creditor agreed to a temporary repayment arrangement under which, commencing in 
August 2013, Applicant would make monthly payments of $75 for approximately six 
months, at which time a permanent arrangement would be made. He made the required 
payments for four months.53 The creditor apparently sold the account to another 
company, and Applicant was subsequently offered a settlement for $4,000, to be made 
in two payments. Applicant was unable to make those payments so he declined the 
offer.54 Applicant stopped making his monthly payments, but intends to resume making 
them.55 Applicant was also confused about the account because his credit report 
reflected the account as charged off, and he interpreted that as meaning he no longer 
owed any money on the account.56 The account has not been resolved. 
 
Applicant obtained financial counseling in December 2014, and he subsequently 
submitted a Household Budget and Financial Planning Worksheet that reflected a net 
monthly income of $4,324.74, total monthly living expenses of $2,997, and $690.01 in

monthly debt payments. He also set aside $320.26 each month for savings and 
investments, leaving an additional $317.47 for discretionary savings or spending.57 
Included in his monthly debt payments are three credit cards (balances of $600, $200, 
and $941.25), two signature loans (balances of $963.97 and $1,204.07), a government 
debt (his IRS liability of $12,800), and a furniture debt ($1,800), totaling $18,509.29.58 
He has approximately $10,000 in his retirement 401(k) account.59  
 
Applicant purchased a new car in July 2014 for approximately $25,000, for which 
he makes a monthly payment of $578.60 His 38-year-old disabled daughter resides in 
the family residence.61 When asked about his intentions with regard to his delinquent 
debts, Applicant stated that he planned to continue making his income tax payments 
and his delinquent car payment, and to resume his payment for his other delinquent car 
loan. He also intends to look for ways to reduce his expenses.62  
 
Character References 
 
 A retired navy chief petty officer, and current federal contractor, has known 
Applicant for nine years. They are friends and attend the same church. He has 
characterized Applicant as very ethical, extremely trustworthy, highly respected, and a 
person with high standards and high morals. Applicant is very active in his church, both 
as a greeter and a Sunday school teacher.63 Another friend has known Applicant for 
over 30 years, and her husband has known him for 15 years. They have referred to him 
as honest, trustworthy, an “overall wonderful person,” and would trust him with all they 
own as well as their respective lives.64 A coworker, who has known Applicant for about 
13 years while she worked in the business office as a manager and he has worked in 
another department, has come to know him more personally over the years. She has 
characterized him as reliable, honest, and hardworking, and she indicated he has 
admirable values and ethics.65 
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security

emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”66 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”67   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”68 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.69  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the

possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”70 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”71 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. “Consistent spending beyond one’s means, which may be indicated 
by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, 
and/or other financial analysis” may also be potentially disqualifying under AG ¶ 19(e). 
In addition, a “failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required. . .” may raise security concerns under AG ¶ 19(g). Applicant filed Chapter 7 
bankruptcies in 1992, 2001, and 2009; he failed to timely file his 2013 federal income 
tax return; he failed to timely pay his federal income tax for the tax years 2008 through 
2012; and he lost two vehicles to repossession. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), 19(e), and 19(g) 
apply.

The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(b), financial security concerns 
may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person has received or 
is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). 
Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated a good-
faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”72  
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) all partially apply. Applicant’s earlier financial 
problems were caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did spend beyond 
his means. But his spending conduct eventually evolved into a more responsible form. 
After finally doing well financially, his new significant financial problems started in late 
2004 and carried over past mid-2005 when two destructive hurricanes struck within 
months of each other badly damaged the residence which was initially serving as a 
rental property and then as his primary residence.  For a substantial period thereafter, 
he was overwhelmed with hurricane-related priorities such as repairing the extensive 
damage to the residence after each hurricane, providing for his family, shelter, and 
keeping his job. Applicant exhausted his savings when the insurance was insufficient to 
cover the repairs. When the termite infestation destroyed his residence, Applicant 
simply gave up. 
Several years later, with his continuing financial difficulties, and $182,679.07 in 
liabilities, Applicant was again forced into bankruptcy. During the ensuing years, 
although he filed his federal income tax returns for 2008 through 2012, he simply did not 
have the total of $12,600 to pay his actual taxes covering those years. His wife’s 
medical condition caused him to withdraw $8,000 from his 401(k) to cover the uninsured 
costs. He also withdrew another $2,000 to pay other bills. Applicant did not ignore his 
creditors. He engaged the professional services of an attorney to assist him with his 
income tax problems, and he entered into an installment agreement covering his 
income tax deficiencies. He is currently making his routine monthly payments. One of 
his two automobile loans was addressed for a period of time, and he intends to resume 
his payments. The status of the other automobile loan is unclear, and Applicant is 
                                                          
72
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

awaiting information from the creditor to determine if there is a continuing financial 
liability.  
Applicant finally received counseling from a financial counselor, and he now has 
a budget. He sets aside $320.26 each month for savings and investments, and has 
$317.47 available each month for discretionary savings or spending. He has started 
rebuilding his credit by opening up some credit cards with small balances and making 
routine monthly payments. Applicant’s newer accounts are current. There are clear 
indications that Applicant’s financial problems are finally under control. Applicant’s 
actions under the circumstances confronting him, do not cast doubt on his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.73 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG & 15:       
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
 The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 16(d), it is potentially disqualifying if there is 
 
credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other 
guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, 
but which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-
person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not 
properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited 
to consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. . . .  
 
Under AG ¶ 16(e), it is also potentially disqualifying if there is 
personal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, that 
creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . . 
engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person’s personal, 
professional, or community standing. . . .

13 
                                      
 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for 2013, and he failed to 
timely pay his federal income tax for 2008 through 2012. AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(e) have 
been established. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from personal conduct. AG ¶ 17(c) may apply if “the offense is so 
minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened 
under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, AG ¶ 17(e) may 
apply if “the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to 
exploitation, manipulation, or duress.”  
AG ¶¶ 17(c) and 17(e) apply. In late 2004, and carrying over to mid-2005, two 
devastating hurricanes struck within months of each other badly damaging Applicant’s 
residence which was initially serving as a rental property and then as his primary 
residence. Those two hurricanes were extraordinarily unique circumstances. 
Devastation was everywhere. For substantial periods during and thereafter, he was 
overwhelmed with hurricane-related priorities. While he managed to file his federal 
income tax returns for 2008 through 2012, he simply did not have the total of $12,600 to 
pay his actual taxes covering those years. His attorney assisted him in filing his 2013 
federal income tax return. Applicant entered into an installment agreement covering his 
income tax deficiencies, and he is currently making his routine monthly payments. 
Applicant has taken positive steps to eliminate or avoid similar circumstances.  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant’s earlier 
financial problems were caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did spend 
beyond his means. As a result, he filed for bankruptcy and had his debts discharged in 
 
14 
                                      
 
1992 and 2001. He lost two automobiles to repossession after falling behind in his 
payments. He failed to timely pay his federal income tax liabilities during the period 2008 
through 2012. He failed to timely file his federal income tax return for 2013.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial than 
the disqualifying evidence. Applicant served honorably with the U.S. Navy for 20 years 
before retiring. He previously held a secret security clearance while on active duty, and 
there is no evidence of any security violations. Persons who have known him for many 
years have characterized him as very ethical, extremely trustworthy, highly respected, 
and honest. Applicant was very naïve about financial matters, never having had 
financial counseling or guidance when he was growing up. While his earlier financial 
problems were caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did spend beyond 
his means, his spending conduct eventually evolved into a more responsible form.  
After finally doing well financially, his new significant financial problems started in 
late 2004 and carried over past mid-2005 when two devastating hurricanes struck within 
months of each other and badly damaged the residence which was initially serving as a 
rental property and then as his primary residence. Overwhelmed with hurricane-related 
priorities, such as repairing the extensive damage to the residence after each hurricane, 
providing for his family, shelter, and keeping his job, Applicant exhausted his savings as 
the insurance was insufficient to cover the repairs. When the termite infestation 
destroyed his residence, Applicant simply gave up. Nevertheless, Applicant obtained 
the assistance of an attorney to assist him with his federal income tax problems. He has 
been enrolled in an installment agreement with the IRS and is routinely making his 
monthly payments. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems and 
associated personal conduct are under control. His actions under the circumstances do 
not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:74 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts

simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Nevertheless, this decision should serve as a warning that his failure 
to continue his debt-resolution efforts or the actual accrual of new delinquent debts will 
adversely affect his future eligibility for a security clearance.75 Overall, the record 
evidence leaves me without substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility 
and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations and personal 
conduct. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   For APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:    For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a:    For Applicant 
     
  
                                                          
75
 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant, the decision, including the warning, should not 
be interpreted as being contingent on future monitoring of Applicant’s financial condition. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach conditions to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 
2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 06-26686 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd. 
Sep. 18, 2006); ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-17410 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 
12, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0109 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000). 
 
 
16 
                                      
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
