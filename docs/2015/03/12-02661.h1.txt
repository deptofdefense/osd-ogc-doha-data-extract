Decision

METZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:
Based on the record in this case,  I deny Applicant’s clearance.1
On 25 February 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a Statement of
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial
Considerations.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the2
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 28
August 2014, and I convened a hearing 25 September 2014. DOHA received the
transcript (Tr.) 3 October 2014.
The original creditor sold a debt of $2,042 to another lender in August 2009 (GE 2). That lender sold the3
account to a third lender in May 2011. The third lender reported acquiring a $2,043 debt, that had grown to
$2,766 in November 2011. The account numbers match exactly. The Government investigator asked Applicant
about this debt—at the $2,766 figure—during his November 2011 subject interview (GE 4). The $28,749 figure
first appears in a June 2013 credit report by Equifax (GE 3) as the total owed, with a past-due balance of
$2,879. The $28,749 figure occurs nowhere else in any of the credit reports. However, in the May 2013 credit
report that Applicant submitted with his answer to DOHA interrogatories in June 2013 (GE 4), TransUnion,
Experian, and Equifax each report a past-due balance of $2,837. Both TransUnion and Equifax report that the
original amount of the debt was $2,043. An August 2014 Equifax credit report (GE 5) reports a total balance
and past-due balance of $3,355. Account notations reflect that Applicant was disputing the account.
Applicant’s August 2014 Experian credit report (AE D) reflects both the original creditor’s sale of the account
and the current creditor’s reported past-due balance of $3,355, updated from the creditor’s processing of his
dispute in May 2013. Consequently, I conclude that the $28,749 figure is most likely a key-stroke error in
reporting the total balance in June 2013, and that the correct balance is $3,355.

Findings of Fact
Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a-1.b.. 1.d, and 1.g-1.h; he denied SOR
allegations 1.c and 1.e-1.f. He denied SOR debt 1.c as a duplicate of debt 1.h.
However, the two accounts have different account numbers, and I conclude that they
are separate accounts. He denied SOR 1.e because he has no knowledge of the
account. He denied SOR 1.f because the creditor reportedly could not find any record of
the account.
Applicant is a 52-year-old systems administrator employed by a defense
contractor since July 2011. He has been employed on the same contract by two
different contractors since July 2005. Applicant was employed by a different
Government contractor in another state from February 2003 to July 2005. Applicant
served in the U.S. military from December 1979 to February 2003, when he retired in
paygrade E-6. He seeks to retain the security he has held as necessary since entering
the military.                
             
The SOR alleges, and Government exhibits (GE 2-3, 5) establish, eight
delinquent debts totaling over $47,000. However, after careful examination of the five
credit reports in the record, I conclude that the correct amount of the debt at SOR 1.c is
$3,355, not $28,749.  Consequently, the correct amount at issue is just over $22,000.3
All these debts are the sole obligation of Applicant.
Applicant admits five delinquent debts totaling $16,000. He denied three debts
totaling $31,300, corrected to $5,900. Record evidence reflects that Applicant accepted
a July 2014 offer from the creditor at SOR 1.a to settle the account for a fifty percent
discount, by paying $64 monthly beginning July 2014 (AE E). Applicant documented the
July and August 2014 payments, and testified that he had made the September 2014
payment (Tr. 36). Applicant paid SOR debt 1.d in May 2014 (AE C). In April 2014, the
creditor at SOR 1.h offered to settle the debt for a lump-sum payment of twenty-five
percent of the amount due paid within the next month, or a payment plan of unspecified
amount and duration (AE B). Applicant accepted a 12-month plan, and has made the
However, during his November 2011 subject interview, Applicant told the Government investigator that he4
filed for divorce.
Applicant’s clearance application listed a “friend” and “roommate” to confirm his current address in November5
2011. He later listed a  “cohabitant” who had a different name.

required monthly payments from May 2014 through September 2014. The payments run
through April 2015.
Applicant married in August 1982, and had twin sons with his wife in August
1986. They separated in February 2003, so Applicant could be with his new partner.
They remained separated without further action until sometime in 2011, when his wife
filed for divorce (Tr. 34-35).  Their divorce was final in June 2013.4
After Applicant and his wife separated in February 2003, he and his partner
moved in together. Applicant and his partner separated sometime in 2009. Applicant
attributes his financial problems largely to this separation (Tr. 32-34), although he also
states his financial problems were exacerbated when his wife filed for divorce in 2011.
Applicant acquired a new partner in December 2010 (GE 1).  They married in5
November 2013 (Tr. 47).
 Applicant provided no work or character references. His June 2013 personal
financial statement (GE 4) reflected about $3,330 positive monthly cash flow. He
estimated his current monthly cash flow at $2,500-3,000 (Tr 46). His personal financial
statement (PFS) shows no payments to any of the creditors alleged in the SOR.
Applicant has been continuously employed since his 2003 retirement. He has not
received any credit or financial counseling.
Policies
The adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to evaluate a person’s suitability for
access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and
mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.
Each decision must also show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the
factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is
not, by itself, conclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed when a case
can be measured against them, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or
denial of a clearance. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,
the relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).
Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s security clearance. The Government
must prove, by substantial evidence, disputed facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the
burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s case.
Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden
of persuasion.
See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).6

Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a
compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgement,
reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.
The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard compels deciding any
reasonable doubt about an Applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the Government.6
                                   
Analysis
The Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and
Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has $22,000 in delinquent
debt that he voluntarily incurred and has yet to resolve.  Moreover, despite the fact that7
a Government investigator discussed these debts with Applicant in November 2011,
and DOHA queried Applicant about the status of these debts in June 2013, he took no
documented action to address any of the debts until after he received the SOR in
February 2014. He fully resolved only one $80 debt and made repayment plans on only
two of the remaining seven debts.
In addition, Applicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial
considerations. His financial difficulties are recent, not infrequent, and ongoing.  While8
the circumstances that caused and exacerbated his indebtedness were beyond his
control, he has not demonstrated that his changed living circumstances prevented him
from addressing his delinquent debts any sooner than he did. Six of the eight debts
alleged are substantially below $1,000 each. He cannot be considered to have acted
responsibly in addressing his debts under the circumstances, because the debts have
lingered for many years without resolution or serious efforts toward resolution.  Further,9
Applicant appears not to have undertaken any effort to address his debts until he
received the SOR in February 2014. Moreover, the minimal efforts he has undertaken
do not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve his debts.  10
Although Applicant appears to have the means to address his delinquent
debts—and has had since at least June 2013—he has established no meaningful
timetable for their resolution. He has not received credit or financial counseling. His PFS
showed no payments to any of his creditors. He certainly has not demonstrated that
¶ 20 (c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications11
that the problem is being resolved or is under control;
5
these delinquent debts are being resolved in an expeditious manner.  Further, he has11
not provided any work or character references to establish a “whole-person” analysis
supporting a favorable clearance action. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.
Formal Findings
Paragraph 1. Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs a-h: Against Applicant
Conclusion
Under the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant. Clearance denied.
