Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny him a security
clearance to work in the defense industry. He has a history of financial problems or
difficulties dating back to 2009, when he defaulted on a mortgage loan due to a
business failure in 2008 during the economic crisis. The house was in foreclosure status
for several years until it was sold in early 2014. The mortgage lender issued Applicant a
Form 1099-C thereby cancelling the deficiency balance. In addition, he submitted
sufficient documentation to resolve four medical collection accounts for a total of
$1,923. He also submitted documentation showing that his overall financial situation is
stable and he is not overextended. He met his burden to present sufficient evidence to
explain and mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Accordingly, this case
is decided for Applicant.
 Exhibit 1 (this document is commonly known as a security clearance application). 1
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG
replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on January 14, 2012.  After reviewing the application and1
information gathered during a background investigation, the DOD,  on October 16,2
2014, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that
it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to
classified information.  The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the reasons for the3
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. He
answered the SOR on November 15, 2014, and requested a hearing. 
The case was assigned to me on February 25, 2015. The hearing was held as
scheduled on March 23, 2015. Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1–4, and they were
admitted. Applicant offered Exhibits A–I, and they were admitted. The hearing transcript
(Tr.) was received on March 31, 2015.
The record was kept open until April 20, 2015, to provide Applicant an
opportunity to submit additional documentation. Those matters (to include his
explanatory e-mails) were timely submitted and they are admitted as Exhibits J–S.  
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 42-year-old storage consultant for a technology company. He is
seeking to obtain a security clearance for the first time. He has worked for his current
employer since 2008. Before that, he worked as an account support manager for a
technology company during 1996–2008.  
The SOR alleged five delinquent accounts consisting of a past-due mortgage
loan in the amount of $130,385, with a balance of $290,297, and four medical collection
accounts for a total of $1,923. Applicant’s adverse financial history dates to the
2008–2009 period when he experienced a business failure (with no connection to his
employment) that in time led to defaulting on the mortgage loan for his residence. A
brief discussion of the business, its failure, and the subsequent mortgage default and
foreclosure follows below.

In 2007, Applicant opened a computer-related business.  The business plan4
called for providing a place for computer gamers to gather and compete against each
other face-to-face and in large numbers as opposed to playing from home. Applicant
described it as a gamers’ lounge. Applicant was interested in providing a safe location
for gamers (primarily teenage boys) rather than spending time alone at home or on the
street. Applicant made money by charging an hourly fee as well as concession sales. 
Applicant used $135,000 to start the business, consisting of $35,000 of his own
money, $50,000 obtained by an home-equity line-of-credit (HELOC), and a $50,000
bank loan or investment. The business was hit hard by the economic crisis that began in
2008 as his customers no longer had discretionary money to spend. Applicant decided
to close and liquidate the business by April 2008. Tax paperwork from 2009 shows the
business had a loss of nearly $34,000.  5
By 2009, Applicant had defaulted on the mortgage loan. The value of his house
decreased substantially and he was upside down on the mortgage loan. He was in
contact with the lender in an effort to resolve the situation, including a short sale, but
was unsuccessful. A January 2012 credit report shows the mortgage loan had a high
balance of $295,535, a current balance of $290,297, a past-due balance of $70,538,
was past due more than 180 days, and foreclosure proceedings had been initiated.  A6
December 2013 credit report shows the mortgage loan had a past-due balance of
$130,385 and that foreclosure proceedings had started.7
Applicant vacated the house in about December 2013,  and the house was sold8
in a foreclosure sale in February 2014.  The mortgage lender issued a Tax Year 20149
Form 1099-C to Applicant showing the following: (1) date of event 04/23/2014; (2)
amount of debt discharged $174,797; and (3) fair market value of the property
$115,500.  The effect of the Form 1099-C was to cancel the deficiency balance. 10
Applicant had a number of medical collection accounts, some of which were
resolved before the SOR was issued. He speculated that he did not receive the medical

bills due to his employer changing the provider of his health care insurance.  The four11
medical collection accounts in the SOR are discussed briefly below.
The $99 medical collection account in SOR ¶ 1.a is resolved. This debt appears
in the December 2013 credit report. Applicant submitted documentation showing that
there was a billing error and the remaining balance was paid-in-full in January 2014.12
The $190 medical collection account in SOR ¶ 1.c is resolved. This debt appears
in the January 2012 credit report, but not in the December 2013 credit report. Applicant
was unable to provide documentation from the creditor, but he provided sufficient
information of his communications with the creditor to show that the debt is satisfied.13
The $905 medical collection account in SOR ¶ 1.d is resolved. This debt appears
in the January 2012 credit report, but not in the December 2013 credit report. Applicant
submitted documentation showing that the debt was cancelled or forgiven.14
The $729 medical collection account in SOR ¶ 1.e is resolved. This debt appears
in the January 2012 credit report, but not in the December 2013 credit report. Applicant
submitted documentation showing that the debt was cancelled or forgiven.15
In addition to the four medical collection accounts in the SOR, Applicant
submitted documentation showing that he resolved about eight other medical collection
accounts.16
Applicant submitted documentation about his overall financial situation as follows:
(1) he has three credit card accounts with total available credit of more than $13,000
with current balances of $0; (2) he has a checking account balance of $10,598; (3) he
has a credit score of 699; (4) he has investment accounts of about $153,000; and (5) he
has a savings account balance of about $29,000.  He stated that his current annual17
base salary is about $116,000 with a bonus of $10,000 to $25,000, and that he has not
made less than $130,000 in the past several years.  18

Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As19
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt20
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An21
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  22
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting23
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An24
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate25
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  26
In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a
preponderance of the evidence.  The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s27
reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence
standard.28

is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness or recurring
financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In
security clearance cases, “the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances
surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation
omitted). 
 AG ¶ 18.  32

The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. The
Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those
persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it29
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant30
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern is: 31
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  32
The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly compromise
classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It encompasses
concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important qualities. A
person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or
negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.    
The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. Taken together, the evidence indicates inability or unwillingness

to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning33 34
of Guideline F. 
 In mitigation, I have considered six mitigating conditions under Guideline F,  and35
I have especially considered the following as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or death, divorce, or
separation), and the [person] acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved and is under control; and
AG ¶ 20(d) the [person] initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts.
Applicant’s main financial problem, the past-due mortgage loan that went into
foreclosure, was connected to the business failure, which was a circumstance largely
beyond his control. He acted responsibly under difficult circumstances by quickly closing
and liquidating the business before he incurred a greater loss. The mortgage loan was
resolved via the foreclosure sale and the mortgage lender then elected to cancel the
deficiency balance. The remaining four medical collection accounts were resolved by
payment or were forgiven or cancelled. He also resolved several other medical
collection accounts. 
At present, it is apparent the delinquent accounts in the SOR are resolved and
under control based, in part, on Applicant’s good-faith effort to repay creditors.
Moreover, I am not concerned that Applicant will have a recurrence of similar financial
problems, because he is financially stable and not overextended. He knows how to earn
money, save money, and invest money. In other words, he’s financially savvy and
unlikely to make similar mistakes in the future. 
Applicant met his burden to present sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate
the financial considerations security concern. I have no doubts about his reliability,
trustworthiness, and good judgment. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence
as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable
evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.36

Accordingly, I conclude that he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to
classified information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.e: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility is granted.
