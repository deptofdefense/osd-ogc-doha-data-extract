HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 25 delinquent, collection, or 
charged-off accounts, totaling $15,446. She failed to provide sufficient documentation of 
her progress resolving her financial problems. Financial considerations concerns are not 
mitigated. Her eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 13, 2013, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of an application for a public trust position (SF 
86). (Item 5) On August 8, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), 
dated January 2, 1992, as amended, and modified; DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, 
Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006.    
 
The SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). (Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD was unable to find that it 
is consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility to 
occupy a public trust position, which entails access to sensitive information. (Item 1) 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
The DOD CAF recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether 
access to sensitive information should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On September 24, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and she 
did not request a hearing. (Item 4) A complete copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM), dated January 27, 2015, was provided to her on March 12, 2015.1 Applicant 
did not respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on May 22, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, 
1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k, 1.n-1.t, 1.x, and 1.y. (Item 4) She also provided mitigating information. 
Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 34-year-old military service representative who has been employed 
by a defense contractor since February 2013.3 In 2005, Applicant married, and in 2011, 
she divorced. In 2011, her son was born. She has never served in the military. There is 
no evidence of felony or misdemeanor charges, alcohol abuse, or use of illegal drugs. 
She attended college for four months in 2004, for four months in 2007, and for 14 
months from 2010 to 2011. There is no evidence of security or rule violations. 
 
From May 2002 to September 2006, she was employed as a vocational 
associate. From September 2006 to July 2007, she was employed as a support 
facilitator. From July 2007 to October 2009, she was employed as an inspection report 
analyst. From October 2009 to January 2010, Applicant was unemployed. From 
January 2010 to January 2013, Applicant was employed as a receptionist at a clinic.    
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s credit reports and SOR allege 10 delinquent non-medical debts, 
totaling $5,457 as follows: bank collection debts in ¶ 1.a ($1,308), ¶ 1.m ($679), ¶ 1.n 
($894), ¶ 1.o ($831), ¶ 1.r ($453), and ¶ 1.s ($307); utilities collection debts in ¶ 1.g 
($126) and ¶ 1.l ($472); a store collection debt in ¶ 1.q ($312); and a library collection 
debt in ¶ 1.x ($75).   
 
Applicant’s credit reports and SOR include 15 medical collection debts, totaling 
$9,989 as follows: ¶ 1.b ($301); ¶ 1.c ($1,744); ¶ 1.d ($256); ¶ 1.e ($65); ¶ 1.f ($110); ¶ 
                                            
1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated February 23, 
2015, and Applicant’s receipt is dated March 12, 2015. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant 
that she had 30 days after her receipt to submit information.  
 
2Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
3The source of the information in this paragraph and the next paragraph is Applicant’s February 
13, 2013 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of an application for a 
public trust position (SF 86). (Item 1) 
 
3 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
1.h ($610); ¶ 1.i ($1,422); ¶ 1.j ($103); ¶ 1.k ($245); ¶ 1.p ($256); ¶ 1.t ($1,422); ¶ 1.u 
($69); ¶ 1.v ($2,169); ¶ 1.w ($100); and ¶ 1.y ($1,117).   
 
In her SF 86, Applicant disclosed the following negative financial entries: one 
monthly $30 garnishment to address a $791 medical debt; three unpaid credit card 
debts for $1,176, $679, and $759; one mortgage debt for $223,000 and foreclosure of 
her residence in 2010;4 four unpaid medical bills for $237, $1,607, $278, and $100; and 
one utility bill for $116. (Item 5) For three of the medical debts, she said she called the 
creditors to set up payments; for the medical debt for $116, she said she was making 
payments; and for the three credit card debts, she said she lacked the financial 
resources to address these debts. (Item 5)   
 
In her SOR response (Item 4), Applicant addressed each SOR debt as follows.  
 
Applicant disputed her responsibility for the debts in ¶¶ 1.a and 1.m because she 
believes her husband is responsible for them in her divorce decree; however, she did 
not provide a copy of her divorce decree. She believed her former husband had paid the 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.m. 
 
The creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c garnished $75 monthly from Applicant’s pay, and this 
debt is paid. She said the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.p, both for $256, are 
duplications of each other. She said she had arranged payment plans of $10 each 
month for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.p. 
 
Applicant disputed her responsibility for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e because she had 
a receipt from an insurance company indicating the debt was paid. Applicant said the 
creditor in SOR ¶ 1.f agreed to defer her payments until a garnishment was paid. She 
planned to contact the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.n and 1.o to arrange payment plans three 
months after her garnishment is completed. She planned to contact the creditors in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.q, 1.r, 1.s, and 1.t to arrange payment plans six months after her garnishment 
is completed.  
 
Applicant contacted the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.k, and she offered to 
arrange a monthly payment plan of $10 for ¶ 1.g, $25 for ¶ 1.k, and $10 for 1.p. 
                                            
4Applicant’s SOR does not allege that she failed to pay her mortgage, and her house was 
foreclosed. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five 
circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). The allegations that she failed to pay her mortgage will not be considered for any 
purpose because Applicant has not had adequate notice and a full opportunity to collect and present 
evidence of mitigation regarding this allegation.

Applicant was unable to contact the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.j, 1.u, 1.v, and 1.w, and 
she was unable to verify her responsibility for these five debts. 
 
Applicant said the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i was being resolved with a $257 monthly 
garnishment, and two payments were made and two remain. Applicant said the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.l related to someone else, and she was disputing her responsibility for it.  
 
Applicant made arrangements to pay the debt in SOR ¶ 1.x by September 12, 
2014. She intended to contact the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.y to make payment 
arrangements.  
    
The FORM correctly noted that Applicant’s file contained no evidence of: 
financial counseling; no evidence that she took reasonable actions to address her debts 
after her unemployment from October 2009 to January 2010; and no evidence that she 
made any payments to creditors. (FORM at 4-5) The FORM advised Applicant that she 
had 30 days “to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, 
extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as appropriate.” (FORM at 5-6) The February 
23, 2015 DOHA letter conveying the FORM to Applicant reiterated that Applicant had a 
30-day opportunity to submit evidence supporting her approval or continuation of 
access to sensitive information.     
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Government’s authority to restrict access to 
classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified 
information. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access 
to information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. See Id. at 527.  
 
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”  
Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. “The standard that must be met for . . . 
assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s 
loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to 
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” Regulation ¶ 
C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the 
procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination 
may be made. See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, an 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of 
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the 
whole person. An administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
sensitive information.   
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security and trustworthiness suitability. See 
ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance [or access to sensitive information].” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity 
clearance [or trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). The protection of the national security 
and sensitive records is of paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) requires that “[a]ny 
doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] information will 
be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a trustworthiness 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s SOR and 
credit reports allege 25 delinquent, collection, or charged-off accounts, totaling $15,446. 
 
  In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board 
explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. (internal 
citation omitted).  
 
The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.  
  
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;5 and 
                                            
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving her delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all of her SOR debts; however, she provided 
some mitigating information. From October 2009 to January 2010, Applicant was 
unemployed, and in 2011, Applicant and her husband divorced. These are 
circumstances largely beyond her control that adversely affected her finances; however, 
she did not provide sufficient evidence that she acted responsibly under the 
circumstances. 
 
Applicant receives some credit for the funds paid to her creditors through a $75 
monthly garnishment6 to address the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c, and a $257 monthly 
garnishment to address the debt in SOR ¶ 1.l. The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.p, both 
for $256, are duplications of each other.  Applicant is credited with mitigating the debts 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, and 1.l. 
                                                                                                                                            
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].  
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
6Of course, Applicant loses some mitigating credit because some debt payments were made 
through garnishment of her salary even though her opportunity to establish a payment plan was limited 
because of her limited income and other financial commitments. Payment of a debt “though garnishment 
rather than a voluntary effort diminishes its mitigating force.” Compare ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 4 
(App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2010) with ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (payment of two 
of four debts through garnishment did not bar mitigation of financial considerations concerns).

Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances. She received ample 
notice of her delinquent debts raising trustworthiness concerns. Applicant did not 
provide sufficient information about her finances to establish her inability to make 
greater progress paying her SOR creditors. She did not receive financial counseling.     
 
There is no financial documentation relating to any of her SOR creditors showing 
maintenance of contact with creditors,7 establishment of payment plans, disputes of 
debts, payments to creditors, or other evidence of progress or resolution of her SOR 
debts. There is insufficient evidence that her financial problems are being resolved, are 
under control, and will not occur in the future. Financial considerations concerns are not 
mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
Applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s application for a 
public trust position. Applicant is a 34-year-old military service representative who has 
been employed by a defense contractor since February 2013. Some circumstances 
beyond her control adversely affected her finances, including unemployment from 
October 2009 to January 2010, and divorce in 2011. In 2011, her son was born. She is 
a single parent. Applicant is credited with mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, and 
                                            
7“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

1.l. The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.l were addressed through garnishment of her salary, 
and the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d is a duplication of another SOR debt. There is no evidence of 
felony or misdemeanor charges, alcohol abuse, use of illegal drugs, or of rule violations. 
She contributes to her company and the Department of Defense.  
 
The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more 
substantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial problems. Applicant’s credit 
reports and SOR allege 25 delinquent, collection, or charged-off accounts, totaling 
$15,446. As a result of mitigating SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, and 1.l, she has 23 SOR debts 
totaling $12,974. She failed to provide sufficient documentation of her progress 
resolving her financial problems, which shows lack of financial responsibility and 
judgment and raises unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, 
and ability to protect sensitive information. See AG ¶ 18. More financial progress and 
time without criminal offenses is necessary to mitigate trustworthiness concerns. 
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s eligibility for 
a public trust position, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
public trust position. Unmitigated financial considerations concerns lead me to conclude 
that grant or reinstatement of a public trust position to Applicant is not warranted at this 
time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or 
will not attain the state of reform necessary to justify the award of a public trust position 
in the future. With more effort towards resolving her past-due debts, and a track record 
of behavior consistent with her obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate 
persuasive evidence of her worthiness for access to sensitive information.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude Applicant is not eligible for a public trust position at this time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d:  For Applicant  
Subparagraphs 1.e to 1.k:  Against Applicant   
Subparagraph 1.l:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.m to 1.y:  Against Applicant

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust 
position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.
