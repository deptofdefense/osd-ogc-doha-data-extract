HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 28 delinquent, charged-off, or 
collection accounts totaling $59,257. He failed to provide sufficient documentation of his 
progress resolving his financial problems. Financial considerations concerns are not 
mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 27, 2013, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of security clearance application (SF 86). 
(Item 6) On August 18, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006.    
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the affirmative finding 
under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an

administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. (Item 1) 
 
On September 16, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and on 
October 10, 2014, Applicant sent an email to the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals and waived his right to a hearing. (Items 4, 5) A complete copy of the file of 
relevant material (FORM), dated March 4, 2015, was provided to him on April 20, 2015.1 
Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on June 8, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted responsibility for all of the SOR debts.3 
He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are 
accepted as findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 28-year-old engineering draftsman, who worked for a defense 
contractor since March 2013.4 From February 2012 to March 2013, he worked for a 
technical staffing company; and from December 2011 to February 2012, he was 
unemployed. From July 2010 to December 2011, he was a building engineer. From 
March 2010 to July 2010, he was unemployed. From December 2005 to July 2010, he 
worked in heating and air conditioning. He has never served in the military. He recently 
married, and his spouse is pregnant. (Item 4)  
 
In June 2006, Applicant graduated from high school, and from 2006 to 2008, he 
attended a university. From 2009 to 2011, he attended a technical institute, and in 2011, 
he received an associate’s degree. There is no evidence of security violations or use of 
illegal drugs. He disclosed some of his financial problems on his March 27, 2013 SF 86. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s credit reports and SOR allege 28 delinquent, charged-off, or 
collection accounts totaling $59,257. (Items 1, 8, 9) Ten of Applicant’s SOR debts are 
education loans, totaling $53,880 as follows: ¶ 1.a for $20,844; ¶ 1.b for $8,046; ¶ 1.c 
for $7,700; ¶ 1.d for $4,943; ¶ 1.e for $3,237; ¶ 1.f for $2,920; ¶ 1.g for $2,482; ¶ 1.h for 
$1,957; ¶ 1.i for $1,747; and ¶ 1.k for $1,004.  
                                            
1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated April 6, 2015, 
and Applicant’s receipt is dated April 20, 2015. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he 
had 30 days after his receipt to submit information.  
 
2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.  
 
3The source for the information in this paragraph is Applicant’s SOR response. (Item 4)   
 
4Unless stated otherwise, Applicant’s March 27, 2013 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations 
Processing (e-QIP) version of security clearance application (SF 86) is the source for the facts in this 
paragraph and the next paragraph. (Item 6)

Thirteen of Applicant’s SOR debts are medical accounts, totaling $2,659 as 
follows: ¶ 1.l for $307; ¶ 1.n for $237; ¶ 1.p for $168; ¶ 1.q for $148; ¶ 1.r for $148; ¶ 1.s 
for $102; ¶ 1.t for $90; ¶ 1.u for $54; ¶ 1.v for $919; ¶ 1.y for $239; ¶ 1.z for $127; ¶ 1.aa 
for $70; and ¶ 1.bb for $50. Three of Applicant’s SOR debts are telecommunications 
accounts, totaling $1,474 as follows: ¶ 1.m for $292; ¶ 1.w for $640; and ¶ 1.x for $542. 
Two of Applicant’s SOR debts are financial accounts, totaling $1,244 as follows: ¶ 1.j for 
$1,037; and ¶ 1.o for $207. 
 
Applicant attributed his financial problems to underemployment and 
unemployment. (Item 4) He said six student loans went into deferment and “[o]nce that 
was accepted I had to call them back to establish a monthly payment.” (Item 4) He listed 
the following student loans as being in this payment program: ¶ 1.b for $8,046; ¶ 1.c for 
$7,700; ¶ 1.d for $4,943; ¶ 1.e for $3,237; ¶ 1.f for $2,920; and ¶ 1.h for $1,957. (Item 4) 
He said he “was only able to make small payments towards [his] debt at this time.” (Item 
4) He did not describe the amounts or timing of the “small payments.” He notified DOHA 
that he had a court date for a non-SOR landlord-tenant dispute about damage claims 
and costs of repairs. (Item 4) 
 
Applicant’s FORM repeated the admonition about the absence of corroborating 
documentation and other mitigating information and explained that Applicant had 30 
days from the receipt of the FORM “in which to submit a documentary response setting 
forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as appropriate. If you 
do not file any objections or submit any additional information . . . your case will be 
assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination based solely” on the evidence 
set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 3) Applicant did not respond to the FORM.               
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.

  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports and SOR response. Applicant’s SOR alleges 28 delinquent, charged-off, 
or collection accounts totaling $59,257. The Government established the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible 
applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;5 and 
                                            
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].  
 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
interest.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
 Applicant’s conduct in resolving his delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all of his SOR debts. He did not provide 
sufficient information about his finances to establish his inability to make greater 
progress paying his creditors. Underemployment and unemployment damaged his 
family finances and is a circumstance largely beyond his control; however, he did not 
act responsibly under the circumstances. He recently married, and his spouse is 
pregnant, resulting in additional financial responsibilities. He explained in his SOR 
response that he had placed six of his student loans into a repayment plan and was 
making small payments to his creditors; however, he did not provide any evidence of 
payments to his student loan creditors.  
 
 Applicant did not provide documentation showing his income and expenses, and 
he did not a budget. He presented insufficient evidence about what he has done over 
the last three years to pay his SOR debts or his other debts. He did not provide any of 
the following documentation relating to the SOR creditors: (1) proof of payments, such 
as checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or a letter from the creditor 
proving that he paid or made any payments to the creditor; (2) correspondence to or 
from the creditor to establish maintenance of contact with the creditor;6 (3) a credible 
                                                                                                                                            
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
6“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is

debt dispute; (4) attempts to negotiate payment plans, such as settlement offers or 
agreements to show that he was attempting to resolve these SOR debts; (5) evidence 
of financial counseling; or (6) other evidence of progress or resolution of his SOR debts.   
 
 Applicant’s failure to prove that he has made more substantial steps to resolve 
his debts shows a lack of judgment and responsibility that weighs against approval of 
his security clearance. There is insufficient evidence that he was unable to make 
greater progress resolving his delinquent debts, or that his financial problems are being 
resolved, are under control, and will not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, 
he failed to establish that financial consideration concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s clearance. Applicant 
is a 28-year-old engineering draftsman, who worked for a government contractor since 
March 2013. From March 2010 to July 2010, and from December 2011 to February 
2012, he was unemployed. He was also underemployed during the last five years. He 
recently married, and his spouse is pregnant. These circumstances beyond his control 
contributed to his financial problems. In 2011, he received an associate’s degree. There 
is no evidence of security violations or use of illegal drugs. He disclosed some of his 
financial problems on his March 27, 2013 SF 86. 
The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s clearance is more 
substantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial problems. His SOR alleges 
                                                                                                                                            
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

28 delinquent, charged-off, or collection accounts totaling $59,257. He failed to provide 
sufficient documentation of progress to resolve his financial problems. His failure to 
provide more corroborating documentation shows lack of financial responsibility and 
judgment and raises unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, 
and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18. More information about 
inability to pay debts or documented financial progress is necessary to mitigate security 
concerns. 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial 
considerations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to 
Applicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a 
determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary to 
justify the award of a security clearance in the future. With more effort towards 
documented resolution of his past-due debts, and a track record of behavior consistent 
with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his 
security clearance worthiness. Based on the facts before me and the adjudicative 
guidelines that I am required to apply, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility at this time. 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial considerations concerns are 
not mitigated.   
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.bb:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
