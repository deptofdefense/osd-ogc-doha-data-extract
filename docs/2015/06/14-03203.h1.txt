Decision 
______________ 
 
 
TUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has mitigated security concerns pertaining to Guideline F (financial 
considerations). Clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 11, 2013, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86). On 
August 19, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated 
February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on September 1, 2006 
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations).  The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for 
 
2 
 
 
Applicant, and it recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge 
for a determination whether his clearance should be granted.  
 
On September 23, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR. On January 8, 2015, 
Department Counsel was ready to proceed on Applicant’s case. On January 23, 2015, 
DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to me. On January 23, 2015, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a hearing notice, setting the hearing for 
February 13, 2015. Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 
through 4, which were received into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and 
offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E, which were received into evidence 
without objection. I held the record open until February 27, 2015 to afford Applicant an 
opportunity to submit additional evidence. Applicant timely submitted AE F through 
M(5), which were received into evidence without objection. On February 24, 2015, 
DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.).  
  
Findings of Fact 
 
In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d through 1.h, 1.j, 1.l, 
1.n, and 1.o with explanations; and denied ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.i, 1.k, 1.m, and 1.p, through 
1.v with explanations. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following 
additional findings of fact.  
 
Background Information 
 
Applicant is a 61-year-old truck driver employed by a defense contractor since 
September 2012. He seeks a secret security clearance, which is a requirement of his 
continued employment. (GE 1; Tr. 13-14, 19, 33-37, 70-71)  
 
Applicant was awarded his GED in 1976. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 
1973 to 1976. Applicant went on to serve in the Air National Guard from 1976 to 1978, 
and then in the Army National Guard from 1978 to 1980, and was honorably 
discharged. (GE 1, GE 2; Tr. 13, 19-23) 
 
Applicant has been married three times with his first two marriages ending by 
divorce. He married his third wife in 1998 and has been separated from her since 
2001. Applicant has been living with a cohabitant since 2004. He has eight children 
with his oldest being 40 and his youngest being 7. He is paying child support for his 
two youngest children in the amounts of $135 and $700 per month to their respective 
mothers. However, in the case of his youngest child he is currently paying $778 per 
month to pay off an arrearage owed, discussed below. (GE 1, GE 2; Tr. 13-14, 23-32) 
 
 
 
 
 
3 
 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s SOR lists 22 debts totaling approximately $26,000, and two of the 
largest debts are for child support arrearages in the amounts of $12,721 and $2,456 
owed to two different states. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.v; Tr. 12) Applicant attributes his 
financial difficulties to a vehicle accident in 2005, and two uncovered surgeries in 2006 
and 2010. During these times, he was unable to work and fell behind on his debts. 
Also, he suffers from diabetes and is “in and out” of the hospital.  (Tr. 73-75) 
 
The following summarizes the status of each SOR allegation or debt:  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a – Collection account owed to State A for past-due child support in 
the amount of $12,721 on an account with a balance of $27,296. Applicant stated that 
the balance owed does not reflect the $300 monthly payments he paid for three years 
through an informal arrangement with his youngest child’s mother. Regardless, 
Applicant is current on his monthly $779 child support payments, which not only 
covers his monthly child support payment, but also addresses his arrearage. DEBT 
BEING RESOLVED. (SOR answer; GE 1 – GE 4; AE A, AE B, AE I, AE J, AE L; Tr. 
39-42, 66-69) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b – Delinquent account for $5,721 owed to a finance company. 
Applicant co-signed for an automobile loan for a former girlfriend. She defaulted and 
the finance company repossessed the automobile. Applicant was not aware that his 
former girlfriend defaulted until he was contacted by the finance company. Applicant 
contacted creditor and is making $125 monthly payments. DEBT BEING RESOLVED. 
(SOR answer; GE 1 – 4; AE A, AE B; Tr. 42-46) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c – Collection account for $603 for a cable company bill. Debt arose 
when cable company charged Applicant for equipment that he purportedly did not 
return. Applicant contacted the creditor and convinced them that he did return the 
equipment. This is the same debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.u, below. DEBT RESOLVED. 
(SOR answer, GE 2 – 4; AE B, AE G; Tr. 46-48) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d – Delinquent account for $558 for a medical bill. Applicant contacted 
creditor and is making $158 monthly payments. This is the same debt alleged in SOR 
¶ 1.k, below. DEBT BEING RESOLVED.  (SOR answer; GE 2 – 4; AE B; Tr. 48-49)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.e – Delinquent account for $95 for a medical bill. Applicant paid this 
account in full. DEBT RESOLVED. (SOR answer; GE 2 – 4; B; Tr. 49-52) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.f – 1.h - Delinquent accounts $80, $52, and $52 for medical bills. 
Applicant paid these accounts in full. DEBTS RESOLVED.  (SOR answer; GE 2 – 4; 
AE B; Tr. 49-52) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i – Delinquent account for $44 for a medical bill. Applicant paid this 
account in full. DEBT RESOLVED. (SOR answer; GE 2 – 4; AE B; Tr. 52-53) 
 
4 
 
 
SOR ¶ 1.j – Past-due account owed to State B for child support for $2,456. 
Applicant was making $135 monthly payments, but recently increased his monthly 
payments to $150. DEBT BEING RESOLVED. (SOR answer, GE 2-4; AE B, AE K; Tr. 
53-55, 66-69) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.k – Collection account for $558 for a medical bill. This the same debt 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d, above. DUPLICATE DEBT.   (SOR answer; GE 2 – 4; AE B; 48-
49, 55-57) 
  
SOR ¶ 1.l – Delinquent account for $933 for a medical bill. The amount actually 
increased to $1,245, and reflects debts consolidated in SOR ¶¶ 1.n and 1.o, below. 
Applicant settled the debt for the lesser amount of $1,000, set up a payment plan, and 
is making payments. DEBT BEING RESOLVED. (SOR answer; GE 2 – 4; AE B, AE 
C; Tr. 57-58) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.m – Delinquent account for $53 a medical bill. Applicant made a good-
faith attempt to contact creditor before and after his hearing, but was unable to locate. 
Information on credit report is either inaccurate or incomplete. DEBT RESOLVED. 
(SOR answer; GE 2 – 4; AE B; AE F, AE G; Tr. 58-59) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.n and 1.o – Delinquent accounts for $232 and $278 for medical bills. 
These debts were consolidated by the same creditor as noted in SOR ¶ 1.l, See 
above. DEBTS BEING RESOLVED. (SOR answer; GE 2 – 4; AE B; Tr. 59-61) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.p – Delinquent account for $159 for an unknown creditor. Applicant 
made a good-faith attempt to contact creditor before and after his hearing, but was 
unable to locate the creditor. Information on his credit report is either inaccurate or 
incomplete. DEBT RESOLVED. (SOR answer; GE 2 – 4; AE B; AE F, AE G; Tr. 61) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.q – Delinquent account for $94 for former employer’s equipment. 
Applicant paid this account in full. DEBT RESOLVED. (SOR answer; GE 2 – 4; AE B; 
Tr. 61-62) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.r through 1.t – Collection account for $93 for entertainment company; 
collection account for $356 for cell phone company; and collection account for $300 
for credit card, respectively. Applicant made a good-faith attempt to contact creditors 
before and after his hearing, but was unable to locate these three creditors. 
Information on credit report is either inaccurate or incomplete. Applicant disputes the 
fact that these accounts are his. DEBTS RESOLVED. (SOR answer; GE 2 – 4; AE B; 
AE F, AE G; Tr. 62-65) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.u – Collection account for $603 for cable company bill. This the same 
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c, above. DUPLICATE DEBT.   (SOR answer; GE 2 – 4; AE 
B; 48-49, 65) 
 
 
5 
 
 
SOR ¶ 1.v – Delinquent account for $631 for medical bill. This is a duplicate of 
medical bills previously listed. See SOR ¶ 1.l. DUPLICATE DEBT. (SOR answer; GE 
2 – 4; AE B; Tr. 65) 
 
Applicant’s annual salary is approximately $37,000 and he estimates that he 
has a net monthly remainder of $800 to $900. He has not sought financial counseling. 
Apart from these debts, Applicant is current on all of his other obligations. (Tr. 30, 37, 
71-75) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
 Applicant stated that he does not have a criminal background, and is 
trustworthy. (Tr. 75) He added that his cohabitant is retired military, holds a security 
clearance, and that he and she drive together. (Tr. 76) 
 
 Applicant submitted five reference letters from persons such as his cohabitant 
and co-worker, as well as, former employers. These individuals collectively capture 
the last two decades and describe Applicant from a personal and professional 
perspective. They enthusiastically describe Applicant as trustworthy and professional. 
(AE M(1) – AE M(5)). 
 
                                                   Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible 
rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
 
6 
 
 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in 
this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the 
burden of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 
531.  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” 
See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The 
guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any 
of the criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should 
err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
                                                     Analysis 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
 AG ¶ 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, “(a) inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” 
 
7 
 
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is established by the evidence presented. The 
Government established disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c).   
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the 
circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of AG ¶ 20(a) because 
there is more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. His 
debt is a “continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence. See 
ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-
03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Nevertheless, he receives partial credit under AG ¶ 
20(a) because the debts occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur and 
his behavior does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.  
 
Full application of AG ¶ 20(b) is warranted. Applicant’s accident and surgeries 
were unplanned and costly. He not only was unable to work and earn income, but also 
did not have sufficient medical insurance for 100% coverage. Applicant reached out to 
his creditors, and as noted, has resolved or is resolving all of his debts. He has made 
substantial progress in regaining financial responsibility.1  
                                                          
1
“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 
 
8 
 
 
AG ¶ 20(c) is applicable. Although Applicant did not receive financial 
counseling, there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control. A review of his monthly budget indicates that he is living within his means. 
Having paid or in the process of resolving the debts and having a reasonable basis to 
dispute several of his debts, Applicant is able to receive full credit under AG ¶¶  20(d) 
and 20(e). Notably, Applicant has addressed his child support arrearages and is 
current on those payments. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should 
consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the 
motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, 
exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must 
be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis 
section under Guideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. However, 
further comments are warranted. 
Applicant’s military service and service as a defense contractor weigh heavily in 
his favor. He is a law-abiding citizen and a productive member of society. He is current 
on his day-to-day expenses, lives within his means, and his SOR debts have been 
resolved or are being resolved. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the 
whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating F cases, the Board has previously noted that the concept 
of “‘meaningful track record’” necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
(App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 
99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A 
component is whether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial 
payments to keep his debts current. 
 
9 
 
 
demonstrate that he has “. . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” The 
Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s 
plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and 
realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. 
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for 
the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a 
reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
 
Due to circumstances beyond his control, Applicant’s debts became delinquent. 
Despite the financial setback as a result of his accident and surgeries, it is clear from 
Applicant’s actions that he is on the road to a full financial recovery. These factors 
show responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.  
 
Both the mitigating conditions under Guideline F and the whole-person analysis 
support a favorable decision. I specifically considered his military service, the 
circumstances that led to his financial difficulties, his financial recovery and steps he 
has taken to resolve his financial situation, his potential for future service as a defense 
contractor, the mature and responsible manner in which he dealt with his situation, his 
character evidence, and his testimony and demeanor. After weighing the disqualifying 
and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the 
whole-person, I conclude he has mitigated the financial considerations security 
concerns.  
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative 
process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the 
SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.v:  For Applicant 
 
 
 
 
10 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility 
for a security clearance. Clearance is granted.
