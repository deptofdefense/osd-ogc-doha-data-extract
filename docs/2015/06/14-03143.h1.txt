GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 6, 2013, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On August 12, 
2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended 
and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information 
(December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations 
made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged 
trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed

reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative 
judge to determine whether to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for occupying a 
public trust position to support a contract with the Department of Defense, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether such eligibility 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. In a statement, notarized October 2, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a 
hearing.2 A complete copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was 
provided to Applicant on February 25, 2015, and she was afforded an opportunity, 
within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit 
material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was 
furnished a copy of the Directive, as well as the Guidelines applicable to her case. 
Applicant received the FORM on March 23, 2015. The response was due on April 22, 
2015. Applicant submitted information in response to the FORM, to which Department 
Counsel did not object.3 The case was assigned to me on June 1, 2015.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one of the factual 
allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.o., and 
1.q.). She denied the remaining allegation. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated 
herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of 
fact: 
 
Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been 
serving as a claims processor with her current employer since March 2013.4 She was 
previously unemployed on several occasions during which she was generally supported 
by her parents: from July 2006 until January 2008; from August 2008 until November 
2008; from October 2009 until April 2010; from June 2010 until June 2011; and from 
January 2013 until March 2013.5 Applicant graduated from high school in 1995, and for 
several years attended college courses, but did not receive a degree.6 She has never 
served with the U.S. military.7 She was never granted a security clearance,8 and it is

unclear if she ever held a public trust position. Applicant was married in September 
2000, and temporarily separated from September 2006 until May 2012. Although they 
are no longer “separated,” Applicant’s husband has been incarcerated since August 
2009.9 They have four children, born in 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2004.10 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 It is unclear when Applicant first experienced financial difficulties, but a review of 
her February 2013 credit report11 reveals at least one delinquent account as early as 
2006.12 She reported some other accounts in her e-QIP as being delinquent since 
2007.13 At some point, Applicant’s finances deteriorated to the point where her accounts 
were not timely addressed by her to prevent them from becoming delinquent, placed for 
collection, or charged off. One vehicle was repossessed. Applicant attributed her 
financial problems to her periods of unemployment; her period of separation from her 
husband which resulted in her income being reduced from a two income household to a 
single income household; and having to raise four children.14  Applicant has “always” 
been on Medicaid.15 While there was at least one delinquent medical account, Applicant 
reported no major illnesses or other unexpected incidents that were largely beyond her 
control.  
 
In her February 2013 e-QIP, Applicant stated she anticipated making payments 
on some of her delinquent accounts when she got her income tax refund.16 Although 
she did not specifically use the words “identity-theft,” she did not recognize other 
accounts in her name and said that “somebody must have used [her] information.”17 
During her April 2013 interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM), Applicant stated her future intent was to dispute those accounts 
“in question,” and if those accounts are hers, as well as her valid accounts for which 
there is no dispute, she would set up payment arrangements by 2014.18

The SOR identified 17 purportedly continuing delinquent debts totaling 
approximately $25,183 that had been placed for collection, charged off, or repossessed, 
as reflected by the February 2013 credit report19 and a March 2014 credit report.20 
Those accounts were as follows: SOR ¶ 1.a. for $185; SOR ¶ 1.b. for $178; SOR ¶ 1.c. 
for $2,618; SOR ¶ 1.d. for $12,545; SOR ¶ 1.e. for $871; SOR ¶ 1.f. for $428; SOR ¶ 
1.g. for $4,866; SOR ¶ 1.h. for $1,453; SOR ¶ 1.i. for $598; SOR ¶ 1.j. for $474; SOR ¶ 
1.k. for $212; SOR ¶ 1.l. for $180; SOR ¶ 1.m. for $167; SOR ¶ 1.n. for $161; SOR ¶ 
1.o. for $128; SOR ¶ 1.p. for $70; and SOR ¶ 1.q. for $49.  
 
In her Answer to the SOR in October 2014, Applicant acknowledged all of the 
accounts and, with the exception of one account which she contended she had already 
resolved (SOR ¶ 1.p.), and the account related to a vehicle repossession (SOR ¶ 1.d.), 
she stated she would make arrangements to pay them.21 Applicant has offered no 
documentation to support the creation of any repayment plan, or positive actions with 
her creditors, such as letters, statements, receipts, or cancelled checks. She did not 
submit any documentation indicating she had disputed any of the accounts with either 
the creditors, collection agents, or the credit reporting agencies. She did offer one 
document downloaded from the Internet reflecting that the collection agent for the 
account identified in SOR ¶ 1.l. settled with the attorney general of one particular state 
for making payday loans that violate the state’s usury and licensed lender laws.22 She 
did not submit evidence reflecting that her account was of the type identified or that she 
disputed the particular account. There is no evidence that Applicant has taken any steps 
to resolve her debts. 
 
It is not known what Applicant’s financial resources may be because she did not 
submit a personal financial statement to indicate her net monthly income, her monthly 
household or debt expenses, or whether or not she has any funds remaining at the end 
of each month for discretionary use or savings.  She offered no evidence to indicate that 
her financial problems are now under control. There is no evidence to indicate that 
Applicant ever received financial counseling. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”23 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. Positions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as “sensitive

positions.”24 “The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is 
that, based on all available information, the person’s loyalty, reliability, and 
trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security.”25 Department of Defense contractor 
personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any 
final unfavorable access determination may be made.26  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a public trust 
position. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”27 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.28  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the

2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  
Furthermore, security clearance determinations, and by inference, public trust 
determinations, should err, if they must, on the side of denials.29 In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. 
Under AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially 
disqualifying.  Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” 
may raise trustworthiness concerns. Applicant has had a long-standing problem with her 
finances which started as early as 2006. It is unclear if she found herself with insufficient 
funds to continue making her routine monthly payments or if she simply chose to stop 
doing so, and various accounts became delinquent, and were placed for collection or 
charged off.  One vehicle was repossessed. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
    
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows

“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”30 In addition, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply if “the individual has a reasonable 
basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem 
and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
 
AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do not apply. 
The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties since 
about 2006 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so 
infrequent.” Applicant was previously unemployed on several occasions during which 
she was generally supported by her parents: from July 2006 until January 2008; from 
August 2008 until November 2008; from October 2009 until April 2010; from June 2010 
until June 2011; and from January 2013 until March 2013. She attributed her financial 
problems to her periods of unemployment; her period of separation from her husband 
which resulted in her income being reduced from a two income household to a single 
income household; and having to raise four children. However, Applicant offered no 
explanation as to why she took no action to resolve her delinquent accounts between 
periods of unemployment or after she obtained her current position in March 2013. 
Applicant offered no evidence of a good-faith effort to resolve any of her debts and 
essentially ignored them until relatively recently.  
 
Applicant failed to submit any documentation such as receipts, cancelled checks, 
account records, etc., to support her contentions that one of her delinquent accounts 
was resolved. Likewise, she did not submit documentation regarding possible debt 
consolidation, disputes, or any continuing contacts with her creditors. There is no 
evidence to indicate that Applicant ever received financial counseling. It is unclear if she 
has funds remaining at the end of each month for discretionary use or savings. There is 
no evidence to reflect that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. Applicant 
has not acted responsibly by failing to address her delinquent accounts and by making 
little, if any, efforts of working with her creditors.31 Applicant’s actions under the 
                                                          
30
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
31
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

circumstances cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment.32 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public 
trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.33   
     
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. She has been 
with her current employer since March 2013. She was previously unemployed on 
numerous occasions. She has declared her intention of addressing her creditors and 
resolving her financial problems.  
  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
There is no evidence from third-parties as to her current reputation for reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. Despite her repeated promises to resolve her 
delinquent accounts, Applicant has essentially taken no positive actions to do so. 
Applicant’s actions under the circumstances cast doubt on her current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. Considering the relative absence of confirmed debt 
resolution and elimination efforts, Applicant’s financial issues are likely to remain. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:34

In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of ‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.’ However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has ‘. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.’ The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (‘Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.’) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated an essentially negative track record of debt 
reduction and elimination efforts, generally ignoring her debts.  Overall, the evidence 
leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a 
public trust position. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate 
the trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) 
through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility to 
occupy a public trust position to support a contract with the Department of Defense. 
Eligibility is denied.
