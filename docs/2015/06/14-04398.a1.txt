APPEAL BOARD SUMMARY DISPOSITION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On
September 30, 2014, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for
that decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department
of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. 
On April 2, 2015, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)
Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance. 
Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant’s appeal brief requests a new hearing “so that the records can be set straight.”  We
have no authority to remand a case for a new hearing simply for the purpose of taking in new
evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00976 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2015).  Our authority to review
cases is limited to those in which the appealing party has raised an issue of harmful error.  To the 
extent that Applicant is arguing that the Judge either mis-weighed the evidence or failed to consider
all of the evidence in the record, the argument fails for lack of specificity.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
09-06067 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2010).  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge
considered all of the evidence in the record.  Neither has he shown that the Judge weighed the
evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
08-06438 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2009).  Accordingly, the Decision is AFFIRMED.
