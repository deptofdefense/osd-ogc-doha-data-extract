COACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concern. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 8, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. DOD CAF acted under Executive 
Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 
1960), as amended; DOD 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG). 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on October 6, 2014, and elected to have his case 
decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the Government’s File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) on March 27, 2015. The evidence included in the FORM is 
 
2 
 
 
identified as Items 1-5 and is admitted into the record. The FORM was mailed to 
Applicant who received it on April 10, 2015. Applicant was given an opportunity to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He chose not to 
submit any further information. The case was assigned to me on May 21, 2015.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.j. He 
denied ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f and 1.h. The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. 
After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional 
findings of fact. 
 
 Applicant is 35 years old. He is divorced and has no children. He has worked for 
a federal contractor since August 2011. He has a master’s degree. He has never served 
in the military.1  
  
 The SOR lists 10 delinquent debts totaling approximately $46,208. Applicant 
stated that most of the debts were the result of poor financial decisions he made several 
years ago. He further stated that he is working toward paying these debts. He was 
making progress when his contract was cut last April and he was forced to live off his 
savings. He pointed out that he is current on his student loan accounts, his car 
payment, and three current credit cards.2  
 
 The debts include nine credit card or consumer debt accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.h, 
and 1.j) and one medical delinquent debt (SOR ¶ 1.i). The debts are supported by credit 
reports from April 2013 and April 2014 and by Applicant’s admissions.3 
 
 The status of the debts is as follows: 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h: 
 
 Applicant provided documentation showing he paid SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c. He also 
pointed out that the debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.h are duplicate debts with SOR ¶ 
1.b and the documentation supports this assertion. Additionally, SOR ¶ 1.e was also a 
duplicate debt with SOR ¶ 1.c. These debts are resolved.4 
 
 
 
 
                                                          
1 Item 3. 
 
2 Items 1-2. 
 
3 Items 2, 4-5. 
 
4 Items 2, 4, 7-8. 
 
 
3 
 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j: 
 
 Applicant admitted all these debts and they remain on his credit reports. He has 
not paid these debts or established payment plans for them. These debts are 
unresolved.5 
 
 Applicant did not provide any information about his current financial status or a 
budget. There is no evidence that he sought financial counseling.6 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
                                                          
5 Items 2, 4-5. 
 
6 Item 2. 
 
 
4 
 
 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
AG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have 
considered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: 
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
Applicant has delinquent debts that remain unpaid or unresolved. I find both the 
disqualifying conditions are raised.  
 
The guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns 
arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under 
AG ¶ 20 and the following potentially apply: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
 
5 
 
 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debts which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant’s debts are recent and remain unresolved. He did not provide sufficient 
evidence to show that financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG ¶ 20(a) does not 
apply. Applicant did not present evidence that the debts were due to circumstances 
beyond his control. I find AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. He provided documentation that 
two debts were paid. I find AG ¶ 20(c) and AG ¶ 20(d) apply to SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c., but 
not to the remaining allegations. He provided documentation that SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 
1.h were duplicative with other debts and are resolved in favor of Applicant. AG ¶ 20(e) 
applies to those debts. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guideline and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not shown a track 
 
6 
 
 
record of financial stability, and even though he has made some progress resolving his 
debts, he has not resolved approximately $21,000 of remaining debt.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, 
financial considerations. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 Subparagraph   1.a:     For Applicant 
Subparagraph   1.b:     Against Applicant 
Subparagraph   1.c:     For Applicant 
Subparagraph   1.d:     Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.e – 1.f:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph   1.g:     Against Applicant 
Subparagraph   1.h:     For Applicant 
 Subparagraphs 1.i – 1.j:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
