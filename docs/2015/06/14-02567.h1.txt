GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding personal conduct, foreign 
influence, financial considerations, and alcohol consumption. Eligibility for a security 
clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 30, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and 
submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a 
Security Clearance Application.1 On July 30, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility – Division A (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the

Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and detailed reasons why the 
DOD CAF could not make an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR, as there is no receipt in the case 
file. In a statement, dated and notarized on August 7, 2014, Applicant responded to the 
SOR allegations and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a 
hearing.2 However, on August 25, 2014, pursuant to ¶ E3.1.7 of the Additional 
Procedural Guidance of Enclosure 3, of the Directive, Department Counsel requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge.3 On September 25, 2014, Department Counsel 
indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to me on 
October 14, 2014. A Notice of Hearing was issued on October 27, 2014. I convened the 
hearing, as scheduled, on November 18, 2014. 
 
 During the hearing, 7 Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 7) and 11 Applicant 
exhibits (AE A through AE K) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on November 26, 2014. I kept 
the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that 
opportunity. He submitted one document, which was marked as AE L and admitted into 
evidence without objection. The record was closed on November 21, 2014. 
 
 Rulings on Procedure 
 
At the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel requested that I take 
administrative notice of certain enumerated facts pertaining to the Islamic Republic of 
Afghanistan (Afghanistan), appearing in six U.S. Government publications. Facts are 
proper for administrative notice when they are easily verifiable by an authorized source 
and relevant and material to the case. In this instance, the Government relied on source 
information regarding Afghanistan in selected pages of publications of the U.S. 
Department of State,4 the U.S. Department of Defense,5 and the Congressional 
Research Service.6

After weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the 
relevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by the Government, pursuant to Rule 
201, Federal Rules of Evidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts,7 as set 
forth below under the Afghanistan subsection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted a number of the factual allegations 
pertaining to personal conduct and alcohol consumption in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a., 1.c. 
through 1.e., 1.g. through 1.i., 4.a., and a portion of 1.m.); all of the allegations 
pertaining to foreign influence (¶¶ 2.a. through 2.c.); and one of the allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶ 3.a.). He either denied or failed to specifically 
admit or deny the remaining allegations.8 Applicant’s admissions and other comments 
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 48-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor. While 
he was hired as a linguist in September 2013, he is awaiting his security clearance. He 
was an unemployed care-giver for his father from 2002 until 2008, and from 2008 until 
2013, he was a part-time bookkeeper.9 Applicant never served in the U.S. military or 
any other military.10 Applicant graduated from high school in July 1985.11 In 2006, he 
completed educational requirements for a real estate license.12 He has never held a 
security clearance.13 Applicant was married the first time in November 1997, and 
divorced in July 1998; and the second time in February 2001, and divorced in 
September 2009.14

 Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See 
McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 
n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 
at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)). The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice 
facts that are either well known or from government reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & 
Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize 
authoritative information or sources from the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006) (citing 
internet sources for numerous documents). Tr. at 29-35.

Personal Conduct & Alcohol Consumption 
 
 Applicant purportedly has a lengthy history of criminal or inappropriate conduct 
and alcohol abuse involving police and judicial authorities which, for the purposes of this 
security clearance review, has been characterized as personal conduct and alcohol 
consumption. He was convicted of some charges and other charges have been 
dismissed. Those incidents commenced in 1986 and continued until as recently as 
2013. The alleged incidents were varied, with some involving alcohol and driving 
violations, others were purely criminal in nature, and others involved alleged deliberate 
falsifications on a personnel security questionnaire and during an interview with an 
investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The SOR alleged 
14 such incidents. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): In January 1986, Applicant was working as a cashier at an Indian-
owned convenience store located across the street from the local high school when 
several students were caught shoplifting. The owner chased them out with a baseball 
bat. The police arrived and both Applicant and the owner were arrested and charged 
with assault with a deadly weapon.15 The charge was dismissed in furtherance of 
justice, but Applicant was convicted of disturbing the peace for using offensive words. 
He was fined an unspecified amount.16  
 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.):17 In January 1987, Applicant was purportedly charged with assault 
with a deadly weapon. The charge was apparently reduced in court to brandishing a 
deadly weapon (other than a firearm).18  While the minimum sentence for the reduced 
charge is 30-days in the county jail, Applicant was convicted of the reduced charge and 
sentenced to probation for six months, and he was fined an unspecified amount.19 
Applicant denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, the incident.20  
 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): At some point in late 1990, Applicant was injured at work and 
placed on temporary disability.  Once he returned to work, the disability checks were to 
have ceased, but they continued coming and Applicant continued cashing them.21 In 
March 1991, Applicant was charged with false statement to obtain aid.22 The charge 
was apparently reduced in court to forgery. Applicant was convicted of the reduced

charge and sentenced to probation for five years, and he was ordered to pay 
restitution.23  
 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.d. and 4.a.): In about February 1995, Applicant was charged with 
driving while intoxicated (DWI).24 There is no evidence as to the circumstances that led 
to the charge. Applicant was apparently convicted of the charge, and he was sentenced 
to unsupervised probation for one year, ordered to attend a Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving (MADD) program, and required to abstain from alcohol.25 He successfully 
completed his sentence.26  
 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): At some point in late 1997 or early 1998, Applicant filed for divorce 
from his first wife. His wife was so upset that she reported to the police that he had 
slapped her and prevented her from calling the police.27 As a result, in January 1998, 
Applicant was charged with assault.28 An investigation ensued, and in January 1999, 
the charge was dismissed.29  
 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.f. and 4.a.): In about April 1998, after he had finished dinner, including 
some wine, while Applicant was driving, he was stopped for speeding and later charged 
with DWI. He did not undergo any alcohol tests. He was taken into custody, and after 
spending the night in jail, he was released and his $500 bond was returned. The charge 
was dismissed. Other than Applicant’s comments regarding the incident, there is no 
other evidence to support the allegation, and the FBI Identification Record does not 
reflect the incident.30 
 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.g. and 4.a.): In about August 2001, Applicant was charged with DWI 
3rd offense.31 There is no evidence as to the circumstances that led to the charge. 
Applicant was convicted of the reduced charge, DWI 2nd offense, and he was sentenced 
to serve four days in jail, fined $2,000, and his operator’s license was suspended.32

(SOR ¶¶ 1.h. and 4.a.): In about January 2003, and again in about March 2003, 
Applicant was charged with two separate DWI 3rd offenses.33 There is no evidence as to 
the circumstances that led to the charges. Both charges were tried together in July 
2004. Applicant was convicted of the charges, and he was sentenced to serve probation 
for ten years, fined $5,000 per charge, required to wear an ankle bracelet to monitor his 
blood level for 36 months (the requirement ended after one year), required to install a 
breathalyzer in his vehicle, ordered to attend 90 meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous 
(AA), and required to attend an anger management class.34 Applicant successfully 
completed his probation and community supervision in July 2014. Furthermore, instead 
of merely completing 200 hours of community service, he completed 1,400 hours.35 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.i.): Over a period of time, Applicant’s then-employer, a principal in a law 
firm, owed Applicant’s adoptive father in excess of $67,000. A series of promissory 
notes and agreements were agreed to in 2000, and the borrower was to repay the 
monies by February 23, 2001. He failed or refused to do so. Applicant left his employer 
to care for his adoptive father who was very ill. Applicant repeatedly requested 
repayment by telephone, facsimile, and e-mails, but his requests were ignored. In 
January 2003, Applicant’s adoptive father’s attorney formally requested repayment and 
indicated that if it was not resolved, a lawsuit would follow.36 In June 2005, the borrower 
filed charges against Applicant for harassment.37 It is unclear as to what transpired next. 
At some point, Applicant was either placed on probation or issued a restraining order. 
Eventually, because he was not earning any salary and was a full-time care-giver for his 
adoptive father, Applicant called the borrower and begged for some money. He was 
subsequently charged with violating the terms of the probation/restraining order, and in 
October 2007, he was convicted of harassment and probation violation. He was 
sentenced to 180 days in jail and placed on probation for nine months. He was released 
from jail after 30 days.38 Because the borrower had managed to delay repayment until 
the state of limitations had run, the loan was never repaid.39 
 
 (SOR ¶¶ 1.j. and 4.a.): Applicant rented a room in the residence of his 
employer/landlord from June 2008 until December 2012.40 Over time, some disputes 
broke out between the landlord and Applicant, and in late November 2012, the landlord 
called the police to report that Applicant had been drinking the night before and had

been harassing the landlord. The police and Applicant’s probation officer responded and 
found Applicant asleep in his room. Applicant took a test for alcohol consumption and 
the test registered negative. The landlord also identified a new vehicle purportedly 
belonging to Applicant. The vehicle did not have an alcohol interlocking device. The car 
was actually the landlord’s and not Applicant’s. The police officer and the probation 
officer instructed the landlord not to touch Applicant’s property, consisting of paintings, 
clothing, jewelry, and other items, and that the police would escort Applicant to the 
residence over the next few days to retrieve his property. Nevertheless, the landlord’s 
nephew moved the property to a storage unit outside the property. Applicant sued the 
landlord for theft of some of his property, and the landlord’s attorney subsequently 
called the probation officer in an effort to have Applicant’s probation revoked, and have 
him sent to another state, but the effort was rejected.41 Other than the exculpatory 
affidavit of the probation officer in support of Applicant, there is no evidence to support 
the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.j. and 4.a.  
 
 Applicant has never been diagnosed with alcohol dependence or alcohol 
abuse.42 He has abstained from using alcohol since the day after his most recent DWI 
arrest in March 2003 – over 12 years ago. Before his two DWIs in 2003, Applicant had 
never been in any type of alcohol-related treatment or counseling, other than his 
attendance at the MADD program. Since the 2004 court mandate to attend AA, 
Applicant has continued to attend AA meetings, giving speeches, sponsoring, and 
generally participating in AA where he has gone through the 12-step program. He last 
attended an AA meeting the morning before the security clearance hearing. He keeps 
his sobriety token on the dashboard of his car.43  
 
 (SOR ¶¶ 1.k., 1.l., and 1.n.): On September 30, 2013, when Applicant completed 
his e-QIP, he responded to certain questions pertaining to his employment activities and 
foreign business, professional activities, and foreign government contacts. The question 
in Section 13A asked him to list all of his employment activities, including 
unemployment and self-employment, over the most recent ten year period.44 The 
question in Section 20B asked him if, in the past seven years, he had provided advice 
or support to any individual with a foreign business or other foreign organization that he 
had not previously listed as a former employer.45 Applicant did not include one particular 
company in response to Section 13A, and he answered “no” to the remaining 
question.46 He certified that the responses were “true, complete, and correct” to the best 
of his knowledge and belief, but the responses to those questions may, in fact, have 
been false. In addition, when Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator, he was 
supposed to list all his employers from an unspecified date to the date of the interview.

Once again, as he had done in response to Section 13A, he did not include one 
particular company.47  
 
 The SOR alleged that Applicant intentionally falsified and/or omitted information 
related to Applicant’s relationship with that one particular company. Applicant denied 
intentionally falsifying material facts in either his e-QIP or during his OPM interviews, 
and he explained that relationship. One of Applicant’s nephews, a translator for the U.S. 
Army, recommended that he get in touch with an Afghan company that had a contract 
with the U.S. armed forces. While Applicant considered seeking employment with the 
company, he chose not to do so because it was not enforcing child labor protections. 
However, he did speak with a representative while he was in Afghanistan and offered 
some advice regarding website design and business issues. Applicant referred the 
company to a website designer and an attorney in the United States. There was no 
employment contract or agreement between Applicant and the company. Nevertheless, 
while neither the company nor Applicant considered him to be an employee of the 
company, but merely a consultant or advisor, Applicant was compensated for his efforts 
on the company’s behalf, and in 2012, he was paid about $10,000, partially by check 
and partially in cash. Despite an aggressive cross-examination by Department Counsel, 
Applicant steadfastly denied that he was ever an employee of the company, but did 
concede that he made an innocent mistake or error in responding to Section 20B.48  
 
 (SOR ¶ 1.m.): Another question in Applicant’s e-QIP was in Section 26 which 
asked if, in the last seven years, he had bills or debts turned over to a collection 
agency.49 Applicant answered “no” to the question.50 However, in response to another 
question in the same section, Applicant acknowledged having had his debts discharged 
under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2008,51 well within the seven year period. He certified 
that the responses were “true, complete, and correct” to the best of his knowledge and 
belief. The response to the particular question regarding collections was, in fact, false 
for Applicant had omitted multiple accounts that were placed for collection. He 
subsequently denied he had falsified material facts and explained that some of his 
accounts were discharged in bankruptcy and his medical accounts should have been 
covered by the hospital’s indigent program.52

 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, supra note 2, at 2-3; Tr. at 97-111. Applicant was apparently interviewed 
on two separate occasions by the OPM investigator. He referred to himself as a consultant during the first interview, 
and when the issue of Applicant’s relationship with the company arose during the second interview, Applicant 
contended he offered to again explain that relationship, but since he was not an “employee” of the company, when he 
offered to do so, the investigator was not interested in hearing Applicant’s explanation. See Tr. at 108-111. It should 
be noted that neither a transcript nor a summary of the interviews was offered as evidence. Furthermore, based on 
Applicant’s testimony and the fact that there was no contradictory evidence, Department Counsel accepted 
Applicant’s testimony related to SOR ¶1.n. See Tr. at 112-113.

Financial Considerations 
 
 Prior to giving up his job to become his adoptive father’s full-time care-giver in 
2002, Applicant’s finances were unremarkable. Until his father passed away in 2008, 
although Applicant received no salary, he spent between $3,000 and $5,000 each 
month just for his father’s medication. In addition, his father was in and out of the 
hospital for six months in five years also at a substantial cost, without health 
insurance.53 In the beginning, Applicant had good investments, money in the stock 
market and with a broker, art, and antiques. His credit cards had zero balances. His 
father had a little amount of money. Applicant used whatever funds he had available to 
spend on his father, but after a few years, he started running short and started selling 
his assets. He simply ran out of money caring for his father and honoring his father’s 
burial request.54  
 
(SOR ¶ 3.a.): In August 2006, with insufficient funds and no salary to continue 
paying any bills, Applicant and his second wife jointly filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 
7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.55 They identified 55 creditors, collection agents, and 
debt purchasers holding approximately $279,191 in unsecured nonpriority claims.56 The 
debts were discharged on August 3, 2007.57 
 
Applicant subsequently relocated to another part of the country, where he did 
part-time work house cleaning, translating, and bookkeeping.58 In addition to Applicant’s 
bankruptcy, the SOR identified 12 purportedly continuing delinquent debts totaling 
approximately $18,504 that had been placed for collection or charged off, as reflected 
by an October 2013 credit report59 and a May 2014 credit report.60 Ten of those 
accounts are medical accounts with creditors whose identity has not been revealed. His 
SOR-related accounts were as follows:

 AE D, supra note 55. There is some duplication of debts in Appellant’s bankruptcy schedule. In a 
bankruptcy filing, most debtors list potential creditors, even when the debt may have been resold or transferred to a 
different collection agent or creditor, to ensure notice, and reduce the risk of subsequent dismissal of the bankruptcy. 
If Appellant failed to list some debts on his bankruptcy schedules, this failure to list some debts does not affect their 
discharge. Absent fraud, in a no-asset bankruptcy, all unsecured, nonpriority debts are discharged when the 
bankruptcy court grants a discharge, even when they are not listed on a bankruptcy schedule. See Judd v. Wolfe, 78 
F.3d 110, 114 (3d Cir. 1996); Francis v. Nat’l Revenue Service, Inc., 426 B.R. 398 (Bankr. S.D. FL 2010), but see

(SOR ¶ 3.b.): There is a bank credit card listed in Applicant’s bankruptcy petition, 
with an unpaid balance of $11,585 (increased to $12,041 when it was transferred or 
sold to another collection agent), that was discharged in 2008.61 The account was 
subsequently transferred or sold in 2009 with a high credit of $12,837 (and a balance of 
$12,836) that was initially 120 days or more past due and eventually placed for 
collection with a stated balance of $12,837.62 The account was again transferred or sold 
to another collection agent in 2011.63 Applicant contended the account, regardless of 
the collection agent, is the same account that was in his bankruptcy petition.64 The 
account is not listed in Applicant’s 2014 credit report. Although the account was listed in 
the 2013 credit report, it was actually discharged in bankruptcy in 2008. The account 
has been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 3.h.): There is a bank credit card listed in Applicant’s bankruptcy petition, 
with an unpaid balance of $400, that was discharged in 2008.65 The account was 
subsequently reported as having a past due balance of $347 that was charged off in 
August 2008.66 The account was again transferred or sold to another collection agent in 
2011.67 The account is the same account that was in his bankruptcy petition. Although 
the account was listed in the 2013 and 2014 credit reports, it was actually discharged in 
bankruptcy in 2008. The account has been resolved. 
 
The remaining SOR-related medical accounts arose after Applicant relocated 
and developed sinus issues. During his initial visit to the emergency room, Applicant 
advised the hospital worker that he had no insurance and he was enrolled in the 
Indigent Health Care Program, which provided essentially free health care services to 
eligible residents (those with low or no income) through the counties, hospital districts 
and public hospitals.68 His eligibility for outpatient/ancillary and inpatient services during 
extensive periods commencing on August 25, 2010, and periodically continuing through 
September 17, 2013, was approved, and he was informed that he was not financially 
responsible for any such services.69 Nevertheless, the accounts may have been 
erroneously listed in Applicant’s credit reports. He was not aware that there was any 
issue regarding any of the medical expenses, until he was informed about them during 
the processing of his security clearance application, because he never received any

delinquency notices.70 Applicant went to the county clinic and the human services office, 
and he was also referred to the Medicaid office, in an effort to have the accounts 
resolved. The hospital is investigating the accounts to determine if Applicant has any 
further financial responsibility. In the event there is, because he is attempting to 
reestablish his credit, Applicant intends to contact the creditor(s) to resolve any 
outstanding medical accounts.71 
  
Those unpaid medical accounts are listed in the credit reports and in the SOR 
without any identification of the actual healthcare provider.  Several collection agents 
are identified. The accounts are: SOR ¶ 3.c. for $1,130; SOR ¶ 3.d. for $774; SOR ¶ 
3.e. for $667; SOR ¶ 3.f. for $539; SOR ¶ 3.g. for $536; SOR ¶ 3.i. for $311; SOR ¶ 3.j. 
for $63; SOR ¶ 3.k. for $440; SOR ¶ 3.l. for $410; and SOR ¶ 3.n. for $360.72 
Applicant’s most recent credit report, obtained in November 2014, reflects only seven of 
the ten SOR medical accounts in collection (SOR ¶¶ 3.c., 3.d., 3.e., 3.f., 3.g., 3.i., and 
3.j.).73 
 
Applicant’s average monthly income from his part-time jobs is $1,200. As a 
result, he periodically receives food stamps – a situation which he finds embarrassing.74 
He presently has a minimal balance in his checking account, and he has no savings, 
retirement savings, or investments.75 He has never received financial counseling.76 
Applicant has no other delinquent accounts.77

or intelligence service.82 Applicant was raised in Afghanistan, but in 1982 he relocated 
to Pakistan because of the civil unrest and hostilities during the Soviet invasion and 
subsequent occupation. After residing in Pakistan as a refugee, at the age of 16, he 
immigrated to the United States in 1983.83 Applicant had no contact with his family and 
was lonely.84 Several years later, Applicant and an older co-worker, a native-born U.S. 
citizen, developed a relationship that evolved into a father-son relationship, and 
Applicant was adopted.85 Applicant looked at his adoptive father as his father, mother, 
and siblings all rolled into one person.86 Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 
October 1992.87  
 
(SOR ¶ 2.a.): Applicant has three brothers, two of whom are citizens and 
residents of Afghanistan, and one who is a naturalized U.S. citizen and resident of the 
United States.88 One brother in Afghanistan is a shopkeeper, and Applicant does not 
know what the other brother does.89 None of his brothers ever had any affiliation with 
the Afghan government, military, or intelligence service.90 Applicant last communicated 
with one brother in Afghanistan in 2002.91 He used to speak with the other brother in 
Afghanistan once a year, but no longer has any contact with him.92 He generally speaks 
with his brother in the U.S. on a monthly basis.93 
  
(SOR ¶ 2.b.): Applicant also has two sisters, both of whom are citizens and 
residents of Afghanistan.94 They are both housewives. Neither of his sisters ever had 
any affiliation with the Afghan government, military, or intelligence service.95 Applicant 
last had any contact with one sister in 1998, and he used to communicate with his other

sister on an annual basis on special occasions.96 Although he briefly resided with one 
sister when he was in Afghanistan in 2012, he no longer has any contact with her.97  
 
(SOR ¶ 2.c.): Although Applicant has varied extended family members who are 
citizens and residents of Afghanistan, he really does not even know their names 
because they were all born after he emigrated from Afghanistan over 30 years ago. He 
has no relationship with them.98  
 
Applicant’s last contact with his mother was in 1998. In 2004, when she was 
dying and Applicant was caring for his dying adoptive father, he remained in the U.S. to 
assist his father rather than going to see his mother.99 In 2011, because he was still 
depressed over their deaths, he wanted to go to Afghanistan to visit the graves of his 
biological father and mother.100 While in Afghanistan, Applicant resided primarily with 
his sister and for a period of time with his brother.101 He felt as though the Afghans 
treated him as an American. He returned to the United States because he missed the 
United States, and he has no intention of ever returning to Afghanistan.102  
 
During the civil war and the Taliban periods, between 1998 and 2001 - over 15 
years ago - some of Applicant’s Afghan family members had their houses looted and 
burned, and one of his sisters relocated to Pakistan for a few years. He tried to assist 
them by sending them money, estimated as $30,000, but since that time he has not 
done so.103 Applicant does not own any real estate or other financial interests in 
Afghanistan.104 
 
Afghanistan  
 
Formerly under the control of the United Kingdom, Afghanistan received 
independence in August 1919. It has common borders with Pakistan on the east and 
the south, Iran on the west, and Russia on the north. Afghanistan has had a turbulent 
political history, including the abolishment of the monarchy in 1973, following a coup 
d'état, invasion by the Soviet Union in 1979, occupation by the Soviet Union until 1989, 
and civil war between the occupiers and home-grown freedom fighters, known as 
mujaheddin. Anarchy ensued, and fighting continued among the various ethnic, clan,

and religious warlords and their respective militias even after the Soviet Union withdrew 
from the country. By the mid-1990s, the Taliban rose to power and controlled significant 
portions of the country, imposing repressive policies and Sharia law, guiding all aspects 
of Muslim life. Afghanistan became a sanctuary for terrorist groups. 
 
After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the demands by the United States 
that Afghanistan expel Osama Bin-Laden and his followers were rejected by the 
Taliban. In October 2001, U.S. forces and coalition partners led military operations in 
the country, forcing the Taliban out of power. Following a few years of governance by 
an interim government, a democratic presidential election took place in October 2004, 
and a new democratic government took power. Despite the election, many daunting 
challenges remained largely because terrorists including al-Qaida and the Taliban 
continue to assert power and intimidation within the country. Terrorists continue to 
target United States and Afghan interests through suicide bombings, assassinations, 
and hostage taking.  
 
Afghanistan’s human rights record remains poor. There are continuing 
extrajudicial killings; torture and other abuse; widespread official corruption and 
impunity; ineffective government investigations of abuses by local security forces; 
arbitrary arrest and detention; judicial corruption; violations of privacy rights; violence 
and societal discrimination against women; sexual abuse of children; trafficking in 
persons; and restrictions on freedoms of religion, the press, assembly, and movement. 
 
Taliban insurgents retain the capability and intent to conduct attacks and 
kidnappings of Americans, other Western nationals, and members of the local populace. 
The United States has made a long-term commitment to help Afghanistan rebuild itself 
after decades of war, and along with others in the international community, provides 
substantial assistance, focusing on reintegration, economic development, improving 
relations with Afghanistan regional partners, and steadily increasing the security 
responsibilities of the Afghan security forces. Furthermore, there is increased terrorist 
support coming into Afghanistan from Pakistan and Iran. Not only has the security 
situation remained volatile and unpredictable throughout Afghanistan, but there are also 
tensions with Afghanistan over limiting U.S. military operations. 
  
 The security situation in Afghanistan worsened in 2008, driven in part by 
insurgent access to safe havens in western Pakistan through the porous Afghan-
Pakistan border. In early 2009, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), a semi-
autonomous tribal region in northwestern Pakistan, continued to provide vital sanctuary 
to al-Qaida and a number of foreign and Pakistan-based extremist groups. Al-Qaida 
exploits the permissive operating environment to support the Afghan insurgency, while 
also planning attacks against the United States and Western interests in Pakistan and 
worldwide. Together with the Afghan Taliban and other extremists groups, al-Qaida 
uses this sanctuary to train and recruit operatives, plan and prepare regional and 
transnational attacks, disseminate propaganda, and obtain equipment and supplies.  
 
In 2012, there were a number of insider attacks upon the International Security 
Assistance Force (ISAF), a NATO-led security mission in Afghanistan, by Afghan 
 
15 
                                      
 
security personnel, also known as “green on blue” attacks. Although such attacks 
declined in 2012, they continued occasionally in 2013. In addition, in 2013, insurgents 
conducted a significant number of large vehicle-borne improvised explosive device 
attacks, targeting coalition forces bases, military convoys, and Afghan government 
buildings, mostly in southern and eastern Afghanistan. Travel to all areas of Afghanistan 
remains unsafe due to ongoing military combat operations, landmines, banditry, armed 
rivalry between political and tribal groups, and the possibility of insurgent attacks. At the 
start of 2014, about 38,000 total U.S. personnel are in country, with just over 27,000 of 
those troops in the ISAF. The remaining U.S. troops are supporting Operation Enduring 
Freedom. 
 
Character References and Community Service 
 
 Several long-standing friends and acquaintances, including his father’s pastor, 
several of his father’s doctors, and Applicant’s attorney, have characterized Applicant in 
extremely favorable terms. He is generally referred to as caring, concerned, devoted, 
attentive, responsible, compassionate, enterprising, sober, and punctual.105 In addition 
to his extensive community service, which was well over the court-mandated amount, 
Applicant spent seven years doing volunteer work at a hospital.106 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”107 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”108   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines

are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”109 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to 
establish a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.110  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”111 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”112 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to

Analysis 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern under the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in AG ¶ 
15:  
      
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 16(a), it is potentially disqualifying if there is a  
 
deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  
 
Under AG ¶ 16(b), security concerns may be raised by “deliberately providing 
false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, 
security official, competent medical authority, or other official government 
representative.” 
 
Under AG ¶ 16(c), it is potentially disqualifying if there is 
 
Credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not 
sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, 
but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person 
assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, 
lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other 
characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard 
protected information. 
 
 Also, it is also potentially disqualifying under AG ¶ 16(e) if there is 
personal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, that 
creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . . 
engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person’s personal, 
professional, or community standing. . . . 
There are allegations of a lengthy history of criminal or inappropriate conduct and 
alcohol abuse involving police and judicial authorities commencing in 1986, when 
 
18 
                                      
 
Applicant was 19 years old. Over the years he was convicted of disturbing the peace for 
using offensive words (1986), forgery (1991), DWI (1995, 2001, and twice in 2003), and 
harassment (2005). Other charges were either unsubstantiated or dismissed. As to 
those criminal convictions, AG ¶¶ 16(c) and 16(e) have been established.  
 
 Other incidents involved alleged deliberate falsifications and omissions on a 
personnel security questionnaire and during an interview with an OPM investigator. As 
noted above, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he responded to certain questions 
pertaining to his employment activities and foreign business, professional activities, and 
foreign government contacts. In addition, when Applicant was interviewed by an OPM 
investigator, he was supposed to list all his employers from an unspecified date to the 
date of the interview. Once again, as he had done in the e-QIP, he did not include one 
particular company. The SOR alleged that Applicant intentionally falsified and/or omitted 
information related to Applicant’s relationship with that one particular company. 
Applicant denied intentionally falsifying material facts in either his e-QIP or during his 
OPM interviews, and he explained that relationship. There was no employment contract 
or agreement between Applicant and the company. Nevertheless, while neither the 
company nor Applicant considered him to be an employee of the company, but merely a 
consultant or advisor, Applicant was compensated for his efforts. Applicant steadfastly 
denied that he was ever an employee of the company, but did concede that he made an 
innocent mistake or error in failing to include his advisory position. 
 
 Another question in Applicant’s e-QIP asked if, in the last seven years, he had 
bills or debts turned over to a collection agency. Applicant answered “no” to the 
question, but in response to another question in the same section, Applicant 
acknowledged having had his debts discharged under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2008, 
well within the seven year period. He subsequently denied he had falsified material facts 
and explained that some of his accounts were discharged in bankruptcy and his medical 
accounts, about which he had no knowledge of their alleged delinquent status, should 
have been covered by the hospital’s indigent program.  
 
 Applicant’s responses provide sufficient evidence to examine if his submissions 
were deliberate falsifications, as alleged in the SOR, or merely the result of his 
misunderstanding of the true facts. I have considered Applicant’s background in 
analyzing his actions. His confusion and resultant actions are understandable and his 
positions are reasonable. As to the alleged deliberate falsifications and omissions, 
Applicant denied any deliberate falsification, but he acknowledged having mistakenly 
omitted his advisory role with one particular company from his e-QIP. As it pertains to 
the alleged deliberate falsifications, Applicant’s credible explanation has refuted AG ¶¶ 
16(a) and 16(b).113 In this instance, I conclude that Applicant’s actions do not cast doubt 
on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
                                                          
113
 The Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving 
falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant’s 
intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record 
evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the 
applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  
 
19 
                                      
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from personal conduct. Under AG ¶ 17(c), personal conduct security 
concerns may be mitigated where “the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, 
or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it 
is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment.” Evidence that “the individual has acknowledged the behavior and 
obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other 
inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur” is potentially mitigating 
under AG ¶ 17(d). Also, AG ¶ 17(e) may apply if “the individual has taken positive steps 
to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.” Similarly, 
AG ¶ 17(f) may apply if “the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of 
questionable reliability.” 
 
 AG ¶¶ 17(c), 17(d), 17(e), and 17(f) all apply. As noted above, over the years 
Applicant was convicted of disturbing the peace for using offensive words (1986), 
forgery (1991), DWI (1995, 2001, and twice in 2003), and harassment (2005). Other 
charges were either unsubstantiated or dismissed. Applicant has acknowledged his 
problems with drinking and driving, and he has taken a number of positive steps to alter 
his behavior. He has abstained from alcohol since March 2003 – over 12 years ago. 
Since the 2004 court mandate to attend AA, Applicant has continued to attend AA 
meetings, giving speeches, sponsoring, and generally participating in AA where he has 
gone through the 12-step program. He last attended an AA meeting the morning before 
the security clearance hearing. His remaining criminal conduct was referred to in the 
SOR as personal conduct because it occurred so long ago and has not recurred since 
2005 – ten years ago. Some of the incidents alleged in the SOR involved offenses that 
occurred under rather unique circumstances, especially disturbing the peace for using 
offensive words (1986) and harassment (2005), while other alleged incidents were 
essentially false charges that were either dismissed or never occurred. 
 
Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out 
in AG ¶ 21:  
      
Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable 
judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about 
an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns, but 
only one of those conditions might apply. Under AG ¶ 22(a), “alcohol-related incidents 
away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse 
abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
 
ISCR Case No. 03-10390 at 8 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). 
 
 
 
20 
                                      
 
individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent” is potentially 
disqualifying. AG ¶ 22(a) has been established by Applicant’s DWI convictions in 1995, 
2001, and twice in 2003.  
 
 The guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from alcohol consumption. Under AG ¶ 23(a), the disqualifying 
condition may be mitigated where “so much time has passed, or the behavior was so 
infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
or does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.” In addition, when “the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or 
issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, 
and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if 
an alcohol abuser)”, AG ¶ 23(b) may apply.  
 
AG ¶¶ 23(a) and 23(b) both apply. Applicant has never been diagnosed with 
alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse. He has never failed to follow any court order 
relating to alcohol. Applicant acknowledged his problems with drinking and driving, and 
he has taken a number of positive steps to alter his behavior. He has abstained from 
alcohol since March 2003 – over 12 years ago. He has continued to attend AA 
meetings, giving speeches, sponsoring, and generally participating in AA where he has 
gone through the 12-step program. He last attended an AA meeting the morning before 
the security clearance hearing. After careful consideration of the Appeal Board’s 
jurisprudence on alcohol consumption, I conclude Applicant’s alcohol problem has been 
put behind him and will not recur. 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant was unable to continue making his routine monthly 
payments on various accounts. He eventually filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 in 
2006, and his debts were discharged in 2007. Additional medical accounts 
subsequently became delinquent. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) have been established. 
 
 
21 
                                      
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”114 In addition, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply if “the individual has a reasonable 
basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem 
and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), and 20(e) apply, and AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) partially apply. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and he did not spend beyond his means. Instead, as noted above, Applicant’s financial 
problems started sometime after 2002, after he had quit his job to become the full-time 
care-giver for his father. Until his father passed away in 2008, Applicant spent between 
$3,000 and $5,000 each month just for his father’s medication. In addition, his father 
was in and out of the hospital for six months in five years also at a substantial cost, 
without health insurance. At first, Applicant was able to handle the expenses because 
he had a good portfolio of investments, money in the stock market and with a broker, 
art, and antiques. His credit cards had zero balances.  As a loving and compassionate 
son, Applicant used whatever funds he had available to spend on his father, but after a 
few years, he started running short and started selling his assets. He simply ran out of 
money caring for his father and honoring his father’s burial request. In August 2006, 
with insufficient funds and no salary to continue paying any bills, Applicant filed for 
bankruptcy. The debts were discharged in August 2007. 
 
                                                          
114
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].  
 
ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (internal citation and footnote omitted, quoting ISCR Case 
No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
 
22 
                                      
 
Applicant has never received any financial counseling. Nevertheless, all of 
Applicant’s newer accounts are current. Two accounts listed in the SOR were actually 
discharged in the bankruptcy. It appears that the medical accounts listed in the SOR 
should have been covered under Applicant’s membership in the Indigent Health Care 
Program which provided essentially free health care services to eligible residents. 
Applicant is awaiting information to determine if there is a continuing financial liability. 
He has started rebuilding his credit by opening up some credit cards with small 
balances and making routine monthly payments. Applicant’s newer accounts are 
current. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are finally under 
control. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting him, do not cast doubt 
on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.115 
Guideline B, Foreign Influence 
 
The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set 
out in AG ¶ 6:       
Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual 
has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or 
induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a 
way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by 
any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should 
consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or 
financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such 
considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United 
States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a 
risk of terrorism. 
The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, 
as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in 
a foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is 
sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the 
compromise of classified information.116 Applicant’s relationship with his four siblings 
and his extended family members in Afghanistan, all of whom remain citizens and 
residents of Afghanistan, are current security concerns for the Government. 
The guideline notes one particular condition that could raise security concerns. 
Under AG ¶ 7(a), “contact with a foreign family member, business or professional 
associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if 
that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, 
pressure, or coercion” is potentially disqualifying. AG ¶ 7(a) has been established. 
However, the security significance of this identified condition requires further 
examination of Applicant’s respective relationships with his family members and 
                                                          
115
 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). 
 
116
 See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 12 (App. Bd. 
Feb. 8, 2001). 
 
23 
                                      
 
extended family members who are citizen-residents of Afghanistan, to determine the 
degree of “heightened risk” or potential conflict of interest.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from foreign influence. Under AG ¶ 8(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the 
country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those 
persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a 
position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, 
organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.” Similarly, AG ¶ 8(b) may 
apply where the evidence shows “there is no conflict of interest, either because the 
individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or 
country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships 
and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of 
interest in favor of the U.S. interest.” In this instance, Applicant’s relationship with his 
extended family members is essentially non-existent.  His relationship with one sister, 
with whom he has had no contact since 1998, and one brother, with whom he has had 
no contact since 2002, are largely casual, if not non-existent. As to them, AG ¶ 8(c) 
applies.  Applicant’s relationships with his other brother and sister in Afghanistan, with 
whom he has had no contact since 2012, are now not necessarily casual, but they are 
infrequent. Accordingly, AG ¶ 8(c) only partially applies as it pertains to them.  
In assessing whether there is a heightened risk because of an applicant’s 
relatives or associates in a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant 
factors, including the totality of an applicant’s conduct and circumstances, in light of any 
realistic potential for exploitation. One such factor is the potential for pressure, coercion, 
exploitation, or duress. In that regard, it is important to consider the character of the 
foreign power in question, including the government and entities controlled by the 
government within the relevant foreign country.  Nothing in Guideline B suggests it is 
limited to countries that are hostile to the United States.117 In fact, the Appeal Board has 
cautioned against “reliance on overly simplistic distinctions between ‘friendly’ nations 
and ‘hostile’ nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline B.”118 
 
Nevertheless, the relationship between a foreign government and the United 
States may be relevant in determining whether a foreign government or an entity it 
controls is likely to attempt to exploit a resident or citizen to take action against the 
United States. It is reasonable to presume that although a friendly relationship, or the 
existence of a democratic government, is not determinative, it may make it less likely 
that a foreign government would attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen through relatives or 
associates in that foreign country. In this instance, it is more likely that an indiscriminate 
Islamist terrorist attack on a public place might cause collateral injury or death to 
Applicant’s siblings rather than a targeted attempt by the Afghan Government to obtain 
sensitive information from them. 
                                                          
117
 See ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002); ISCR Case No. 00-0489 at 12 (App. Bd. Jan. 
10, 2002).

 ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). 
 
24 
                                      
 
As noted above, since October 2001, when U.S. forces and coalition partners led 
military operations in Afghanistan, there has been first an interim government, and then 
a democratic government in Afghanistan. Nevertheless, many daunting challenges 
remained largely because terrorists including al-Qaida and the Taliban continue to 
assert power and intimidation within the country. It is less likely that the Afghan 
government would attempt coercive means to obtain sensitive information. The real 
concern in this instance is not the Afghan government, but rather al-Qaida and Taliban 
terrorists. Applicant’s two brothers and two sisters still reside in Afghanistan and there is 
substantial risk – a “heightened risk” – of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, 
pressure, or coercion to disqualify Applicant from holding a security clearance. There is 
no evidence that Applicant’s siblings are or have ever been political activists, 
challenging the policies of the Afghan government; that terrorists have specifically 
approached or threatened Applicant or his siblings for any reason other than during 
periods when the Soviets occupied the country and at least one of his siblings fled to 
Pakistan; that the Afghan government, al-Qaida, or the Taliban have approached 
Applicant; or that his siblings currently engage in activities that would bring attention to 
themselves. As such, there is a reduced possibility that he would be a target for 
coercion or exploitation by the Afghan government, al-Qaida, or the Taliban, which may 
seek to quiet those who speak out against them. 
 
Applicant has significant connections to the United States, having lived in the 
United States for over 30 years. His happiest years have been spent in the United 
States with his adoptive father. He was educated here and considers himself to be more 
American than Afghan. Applicant wants his security clearance so that he can assist U.S. 
Armed Forces in their combat and intelligence-gathering missions in Afghanistan. This 
is not a situation where an applicant seeks a security clearance so he or she can simply 
work with classified information and enjoy the comforts of home in the United States. 
Applicant has offered to risk his life to support the United States’ goals in Afghanistan, 
and has shown his patriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United States. Applicant’s 
continuing relationship with his one brother, a naturalized U.S. citizen residing in the 
United States, is relatively close. Applicant has met his burden of showing there is little 
likelihood that relationships with his other siblings and extended family members in 
Afghanistan could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. Furthermore, I am 
persuaded that Applicant’s loyalty to the United States is steadfast and undivided, and 
that he has “such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that [he] 
can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.” AG ¶¶ 8 
(a) and 8(b) apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
 
25 
                                      
 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated this case in 
light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal 
analysis.119       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant’s earlier 
personal conduct and alcohol consumption issues exposed him to various criminal 
charges, and he was convicted of disturbing the peace for using offensive words, 
forgery, DWI on four occasions, and harassment. Other criminal charges were either 
unsubstantiated or dismissed. His financial problems led to his inability to maintain his 
routine monthly account payments, and accounts became delinquent. Applicant filed for 
bankruptcy in 2006.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial than 
the disqualifying evidence. Applicant immigrated to the United States to escape the 
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, and he entered into a loving and caring relationship 
with an American who eventually adopted Applicant. Applicant has resided in the United 
States for over 30 years, and he has been a naturalized citizen since October 1992. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and he did spend beyond his means. Instead, his financial problems were a direct result 
of his love and compassion for his dying adoptive father. Applicant previously had a 
good financial portfolio including investments, money in the stock market and with a 
broker, art, and antiques. His credit cards had zero balances. But he used whatever 
funds he had available to spend on his father. After a few years, he sold his assets and 
eventually simply ran out of money caring for his father and honoring his father’s burial 
request. Applicant’s bankruptcy cleaned out his delinquent accounts. It appears that the 
medical accounts listed in the SOR should have been covered under Applicant’s 
membership in the Indigent Health Care Program, which provided essentially free health 
care services to eligible residents. Applicant has started rebuilding his credit by opening 
up some credit cards with small balances and making routine monthly payments. 
Applicant’s newer accounts are current.  Applicant has been abstinent for over 12 years, 
and there have been no valid incidents involving criminal conduct for 10 years. There 
are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems, alcohol issues, and associated 
personal conduct issues are under control. His actions under the circumstances do not 
cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.

Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
 
26 
                                      
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without substantial questions and doubts 
as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, 
I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal 
conduct, foreign influence, financial considerations, and alcohol consumption. See AG ¶ 
2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
