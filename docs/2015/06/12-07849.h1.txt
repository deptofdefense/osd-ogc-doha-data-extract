GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 15, 2012, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On June 28, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued her a set of interrogatories. She 
responded to the interrogatories on August 14, 2014.2 On November 18, 2014, the DOD 
CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended 
and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the

Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information 
(December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations 
made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security 
concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and detailed reasons why the 
DOD CAF was unable to make an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR, as there is no receipt in the case 
file. In a statement, notarized December 12, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a 
hearing.3 A complete copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was 
mailed to Applicant on April 1, 2015, and she was afforded an opportunity, within a 
period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in 
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished 
a copy of the Directive as well as the Guidelines applicable to her case. Applicant 
received the FORM on April 15, 2015. A response was due by May 15, 2015. Although 
the memorandum to me indicated that Applicant had submitted information in response 
to the FORM,4 there is no other documentation from her in the case file. The case was 
assigned to me on June 9, 2015.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one of the factual 
allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.b. through 1.j.). 
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I 
make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She had been 
serving as an administrative assistant with her former employer from December 2011 
until an unspecified date, but now is employed by her current employer in an 
unspecified position.5 She was previously unemployed from March 2002 until November 
2002, during which time she received unemployment compensation.6 It is unclear if 
Applicant graduated from high school or received a General Educational Development 
(GED) diploma. She attended classes at a community college from 2005 until 2007, but 
did not receive a degree.7 She has never served in the U.S. military.8 She has never

held a security clearance.9 Applicant has never been married.10 She has one son (born 
in 1989) and one daughter (born in 2002).11 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 It is unclear when Applicant first experienced financial difficulties, but a review of 
her February 2012 credit report12 and her August 2014 credit report13 reveal several 
delinquent accounts as early as 2009. Applicant acknowledged that some financial 
delinquencies occurred as early as 2005 and 2007, and that there were judgments 
against her in 1998 and 2004.14 She also indicated that she opened one credit card 
account in 2003 to help repair her credit.15 Based on the above, it is apparent that 
Applicant has experienced financial difficulties for a substantial period. 
 
It is equally unclear as to how or why Applicant’s finances deteriorated to the 
point where her accounts were not timely addressed by her to prevent them from 
becoming delinquent, placed for collection, charged off, or going to judgment. Although 
Applicant stated that she had been involved in an automobile accident which required 
her to purchase a new car in 2005, that she underwent surgery in 2011, and that her 
bills exceeded her income, Applicant reported no other significant issues such as a 
more recent (than in 2002) loss of employment, divorce, or other unexpected incidents 
that were largely beyond her control.  
 
The SOR identified ten purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, totaling 
approximately $19,623, which had been placed for collection, charged off, or which 
went to judgment. Those debts and their respective current status, according to the 
credit reports, Applicant’s comments to the investigator from the U.S. Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM),16 her answers to the interrogatories, and her Answer to 
the SOR, are described as follows:  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a. - a department store account (for which she was merely an 
authorized user) that was charged off in the amount of $938;17 SOR ¶ 1.b. - a medical

$250;19 SOR ¶ 1.d. – a medical account with a balance of $82;20 SOR ¶ 1.e. - a medical 
account that went to judgment in 2012 in the amount of $13,513 (about which Applicant 
professed no knowledge);21 SOR ¶ 1.f. - a medical account with a balance of $223;22 
SOR ¶ 1.g. – an unspecified account with a balance of $500 that was over 180 days 
past due when it was purchased by another lender;23 SOR ¶ 1.h. – a credit card account 
with a balance of $649;24 SOR ¶ 1.i. – an unspecified account that went to judgment in 
2004 in the amount of $192 (about which Applicant professed no knowledge);25 and 
SOR ¶ 1.j. – an unspecified account that went to judgment in 1998 in the amount of 
$2,968 (about which Applicant professed no knowledge).26 
 
Applicant denied any knowledge of the three judgments against her. She 
contended that she had been working with a credit repair company since December 
2011 in an effort to resolve three of her accounts, and has been sending them $246 
each month so that monthly payments of $82 could be sent to each of the three 
creditors.27 In May 2012, Applicant was initially interviewed about her delinquent 
accounts. By December 2014, she still had not taken any positive action to resolve any 
of her SOR-related debts. Upon receipt of the SOR, Applicant indicated that her mother 
agreed to assist her in paying off most of her debts, and that she established a 
proposed repayment plan. That plan calls for paying off three accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.b. 
through 1.d.) in January 2015; two accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.f. and 1.g.) in February 2015; 
two accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.h. and 1.i.) in March 2015; and making future plans to make 
payment arrangements with two other accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.e. and 1.j.).28 She denied 
any liability or responsibility for the account for which she was merely an authorized

user. Although Applicant received the FORM in April 2015, she failed to submit any 
documentation to support her contentions that she had made any of the projected 
payments to the creditors under her plan. 
 
There is no evidence to indicate that Applicant ever received financial 
counseling. In May 2012, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement indicating 
her net monthly income and monthly household or debt expenses, but that information 
was corrected during her interview. Her net monthly income, including $300 in child 
support, was $2,250; her monthly household expenses were $1,420; and her remaining 
balance at the end of each month for discretionary use or savings was $550, but even 
those numbers do not add up.29 Applicant offered no evidence to indicate that her 
financial problems are now under control. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”30 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”31   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.

In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”32 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.33  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”34 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”35 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant has had a long-standing problem with her finances which 
started as early as 1998. It is unclear if she found herself with insufficient funds to 
continue making her routine monthly payments or if she simply chose to stop doing so. 
Various accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection, charged off, or 
went to judgment.  AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
    
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”36 In addition, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply if “the individual has a reasonable 
basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem 
and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
 
                                                          
36
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
 
8 
                                      
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do not apply. AG ¶ 20(b) minimally applies. 
The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties since 
about 1998 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so 
infrequent.” Applicant was previously unemployed from March 2002 until November 
2002, during which time she received unemployment compensation, but that period was 
well after her initial financial problems arose. Applicant attributed her financial difficulties 
to an automobile accident which required her to purchase a new car in 2005, to her 
surgery in 2011, and because her bills exceeded her income. She reported no other 
significant issues or other unexpected incidents that were largely beyond her control. 
  
Applicant offered no evidence of a good-faith effort to resolve any of her debts 
and essentially ignored them until relatively recently. She failed to submit any 
documentation such as receipts, cancelled checks, account records, etc., to support her 
contentions that her non-SOR delinquent accounts were resolved. Likewise, there is the 
absence of documentation regarding her relationship with the credit repair company in 
2011 or any continuing contacts with her creditors. There is no evidence to indicate that 
Applicant ever received financial counseling.  
 
The only documented evidence attributed to Applicant shows a promise to pay 
her debts on an established schedule. But even her schedule and the associated 
promises appear to be unfulfilled.37 It appears that Applicant has funds remaining at the 
end of each month for discretionary use or savings, but there is no evidence that she 
has taken any steps to resolve even the smallest of her delinquent accounts with that 
money. There is no evidence to reflect that Applicant’s financial problems are under 
control. Applicant has not acted responsibly as shown by her failure to address her 
delinquent accounts and by making little, if any, effort to work with her creditors.38 
Applicant’s actions under the circumstances cast doubt on her current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment.39 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
                                                          
37
 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute 
for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR 
Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).  
  
38
 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.40   
     
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. She was 
previously unemployed from March 2002 until November 2002. She has declared her 
intention of addressing her creditors and resolving her financial problems.  
  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
There is no evidence as to Applicant’s current reputation for reliability, trustworthiness, 
and good judgment. Her long-standing failure to repay her creditors, even in the 
smallest amounts, or to arrange payment plans over a substantial period of years, 
reflect traits which raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. Despite 
her promises to resolve her delinquent accounts, Applicant has essentially taken no 
positive actions to do so. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances cast doubt on her 
current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Considering the relative absence 
of confirmed debt resolution and elimination efforts, Applicant’s financial issues are 
likely to remain. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:41 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of ‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.’ However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has ‘. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.’ The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the

extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (‘Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.’) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated an essentially negative track record of debt 
reduction and elimination efforts, generally ignoring her debts.  Overall, the evidence 
leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a 
security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate 
the security concerns arising from her financial considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) 
through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant  
Subparagraph 1.b through 1.j:  Against Applicant 
    
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
