HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 10 charged-off or collection 
accounts totaling $39,446. She paid four SOR debts, disputed one SOR debt, planned 
to pay one SOR debt in April 2015, and one SOR debt in May 2015. She also plans to 
begin payment plans for two debts in May 2015. She failed to address one $95 medical 
debt. She provided sufficient documentation of her progress resolving her financial 
problems. Financial considerations concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 23, 2011, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86). (Item 2) On April 28, 2014, the Department 
of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to 
Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on 
September 1, 2006.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the affirmative finding 
under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. (Item 1) 
 
On May 29, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and she did not 
request a hearing. (Item 1) A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), 
dated February 23, 2015, was provided to her on March 17, 2015.1 On April 14, 2015, 
Applicant responded to the FORM and provided additional mitigating evidence. On May 
6, 2015, Department Counsel did not object to consideration of the additional evidence. 
On June 18, 2015, the case was assigned to me. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR 
¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e through 1.j. (Item 1) She also provided extenuating and mitigating 
information. (Item 1) Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 47-year-old senior business manager, who has worked for a 
defense contractor since May 1997.3 In 1986, she received a high school diploma. From 
1986 to 1987, she attended a university; however, she did not receive a degree. She 
has never served in the military. In 1991, she married, and in 1996, she divorced. In 
1997, she married; however, she is separated from her spouse. Her two sons were born 
in 1992 and 1998. Her eldest son is on active duty in the Army. (FORM response) There 
is no evidence of disciplinary problems with her employer, illegal drug use, criminal 
offenses, or alcohol abuse. 
   
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s pay was reduced by $30,000 in 2010 because her employer 
experienced a business downturn.4 In September 2011, her company lost a major 
source of revenue and Applicant lost her income. Her home was foreclosed, and she 
closed all of her active accounts. Her pay did not recover until June 2013. In 2013, her 
                                            
1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated March 4, 2015, 
and Applicant’s receipt is dated March 17, 2015. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that she 
had 30 days after her receipt to submit information.  
 
2Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
3Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this paragraph is her December 23, 
2011 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86). (Item 2) 
  
4Applicant’s response to DOHA interrogatories, SOR response, and FORM response are the 
sources for the facts in this paragraph.

gross annual compensation was $40,500. (FORM response, IRS Form 1099 MISC) 
When her pay increased, she began paying her delinquent debts.  
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in the following exhibits: her 
December 23, 2011 SF 86; her January 4, 2012, April 10, 2014, and October 8, 2014 
credit reports; her SOR response; and her FORM response. (Items 2-7; FORM 
response)  
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges 10 charged-off or collection accounts totaling $39,446. 
She paid four debts and disputed one debt. She planned to pay one debt in April 2015, 
and one debt in May 2015. She has payment plans for her remaining SOR debts, 
except for a $95 medical debt, which she does not address. The status of her SOR 
debts is as follows: 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b are debts for $447 and $223 originating from the same 
business and being collected by the same collection agent. (PAID) Applicant paid these 
two debts on January 16, 2014, and on February 18, 2014, as documented in her 
checking account statements. (FORM response)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.c is a medical collection debt for $95. She did not explain how she plans 
to resolve this debt. (FORM response) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d is a telecommunications collection debt for $592. Applicant disputed 
her responsibility for this debt, asserting she has never had an account with this 
creditor. (FORM response) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e is a telecommunications collection debt for $781. She said she 
planned to pay this debt in April 2015. (FORM response) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f is a collection debt for $377. (PAID) On January 2, 2014, and February 
3, 2014, Applicant paid the debt in full as documented in her checking account 
statements. (FORM response)   
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h are telecommunications collection debts originating from the 
same creditor for $1,846 and $368. She said she planned to pay the smaller debt in 
May 2015, and to start paying the larger debt through an installment plan in May 2015. 
(FORM response) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i is a charged-off bank debt for $33,660. This debt was a home equity 
loan borrowed in September 2005, which became delinquent in 2012. (FORM 
response) She planned to start paying this debt through an installment plan on April 30, 
2015. (FORM response) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.j is a charged-off bank debt for $1,057. (PAID) On December 17, 2013, 
Applicant paid the debt in full as documented in her checking account statement. 
(FORM response)

There is no evidence of credit counseling. She did not provide a budget or 
comprehensive information about her income the last several years.   
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt 
is documented in her credit reports, SF 86, SOR response, and FORM response. Her 
SOR alleges 10 charged-off or collection accounts totaling $39,446. The Government 
established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional 
inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
  
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;5 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving her debts warrants application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) to 
20(c). Her financial problems were affected by circumstances largely beyond her 
control. Applicant’s employer lost business; her salary was decreased substantially; and 
then stopped completely for a time. Once her salary resumed, she resumed payments 
to her creditors. She paid four SOR debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, and 1.j); she planned to 
pay two SOR debts in April and May 2015 (SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.h); and she planned to 
begin payment plans on two SOR debts in May 2015 (SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.i).6 She did not 
address the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c, a $95 medical debt. It is noteworthy that she paid the 
four SOR debts before she received the SOR. 
 
A recent Appeal Board decision illustrates the analysis for applying AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
and 20(b). In ISCR Case No. 09-08533 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010), the applicant had 
$41,000 in delinquent credit card debt and defaulted on a home loan generating a 
$162,000 delinquent debt. Id. at 2. That applicant filed for bankruptcy the same month 
the Administrative Judge issued her decision. Id. at 1-2. The applicant in ISCR Case 
No. 09-08533 was recently divorced, had been unemployed for 10 months, and had 
childcare responsibilities. Her former husband was inconsistent in his payment of child 
support to her. The Appeal Board determined that AG ¶ 20(a) was “clearly applicable 
(debt occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and [the debt] does 
not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)” 
even though that applicant’s debts were unresolved at the time the Administrative 
Judge’s decision was issued. Id. at 3. The Appeal Board also decided that the record 
                                            
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
6The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

evidence raised the applicability of AG ¶ 20(b) because of the absence of evidence7 of 
irresponsible behavior, poor judgment, unreliability, or lack of trustworthiness. Id. at 4.   
 
  Similarly, in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal 
Board addressed a situation where an applicant, who had been sporadically 
unemployed and lacked the ability to pay his creditors, noting that “it will be a long time 
at best before he has paid” all of his creditors. The applicant was living on 
unemployment compensation at the time of his hearing. The Appeal Board explained 
that such a circumstance was not necessarily a bar to having access to classified 
information stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for 
repayment, accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which 
evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). The applicant in ISCR Case 
No. 08-06567 used his limited resources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a 
repayment plan for the remaining debts; and (3) took “reasonable actions to effectuate 
that plan.” Id. The Appeal Board remanded the Administrative Judge’s decision because 
it did not “articulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions,” emphasizing the 
Administrative Judge did “not explain[] what he believes that applicant could or should 
have done under the circumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor 
financial condition, or why the approach taken by applicant was not ‘responsible’ in light 
of his limited circumstances.” Id.   
 
  Applicant’s delinquent debts “occurred under such circumstances that [are] 
unlikely to recur and [do] not cast doubt on [her] current reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment.” Due to a business decline, her income was significantly reduced. Once 
her income resumed, she paid 4 of 10 SOR debts, disputed her responsibility for one 
debt, planned to pay two debts in April and May 2015, and intended to initiate payment 
plans in May 2015 for two debts. She did not address her $95 collection medical debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.c. She acted responsibly under the circumstances by maintaining contact with 
her creditors,8 making payments, and paying four SOR debts. Although she did not 
                                            
7Applicant has the burden of proving the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and the burden 
to disprove a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. 
 
8“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

receive financial counseling, there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control.  
  
 AG ¶ 20(d) is partially applicable. Applicant admitted responsibility for and took 
reasonable and responsible actions to resolve her SOR debts, establishing some good 
faith. AG ¶ 20(e) mitigates one debt. She disputed her responsibility for the debt in SOR 
¶ 1.d, which is a telecommunications collection debt for $592, asserting she has never 
had an account with this creditor.      
 
In sum, Applicant fell behind on her debts primarily because of a significant 
reduction in income. Once her income increased, she made substantial progress and 
took reasonable actions to rehabilitate her finances. Her efforts are sufficient to mitigate 
financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 47-year-old senior business manager, who has worked for a 
defense contractor since May 1997. From 1986 to 1987, she attended a university; 
however, she did not receive a degree. There is no evidence of disciplinary problems 
with her employer, illegal drug use, criminal offenses, or alcohol abuse. Reduction in her 
income when her employer lost business caused her financial woes. I give Applicant 
substantial credit for paying, planning payment plans, or disputing her delinquent SOR 
debts, except for one $95 medical debt.

The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence 
of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant 
is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted).  
 
Applicant understands what she needs to do to establish and maintain her 
financial responsibility. Her efforts at debt resolution have established a “meaningful 
track record” of debt re-payment. I am confident she will resolve the remaining debts on 
her SOR when she is financially able to do so, and she will maintain her financial 
responsibility.9    
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
                                            
9Of course, the Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation, and interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the Government 
from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the security 
significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative security 
significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). Violation of a promise made in a 
security context to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may 
support future revocation of a security clearance. An administrative judge does not have “authority to 
grant an interim, conditional, or probationary clearance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 
2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 04-03907 
at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006) (stating, “The Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or 
probationary security clearance to allow her the opportunity to have a security clearance while she works 
on her financial problems.”). This footnote does not imply that this Applicant’s security clearance is 
conditional.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.j:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
