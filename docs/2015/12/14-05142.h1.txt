Decision

CURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:
Applicant financially overextended herself in assisting relatives. Consequently,
she incurred approximately $16,000 of delinquent debt. In January 2015, she began
contacting creditors to develop payment plans and negotiate settlements. Since then,
she has either satisfied all of the delinquencies in their entirety, or has been steadily
satisfying them with monthly payments. Applicant has mitigated the financial
considerations security concerns. 
 
Statement of the Case
On March 27, 2015, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications
Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing
security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry
(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as
At Department Counsel’s request, I marked GE 2 for identification purposes only. (Tr. 10)1

amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on
September 1, 2006.
 Applicant answered the SOR, denying all of the allegations except 1.b and 1.e,
and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on July 18, 2015. On August 4,
2015, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing
scheduling the case for September 1, 2015.
At the hearing, I received seven Government exhibits marked and identified as
Government Exhibits (GE) 1, and GE 3 through GE 8,  and I received two Applicant1
exhibits that I marked and identified as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. Also, I
considered the testimony of Applicant, and took administrative notice of the discovery
letter (Hearing Exhibit I), that Department Counsel mailed to Applicant on July 2, 2015. 
At the close of the hearing, I left the record open to allow Applicant to submit
exhibits. Within the time allotted, she submitted nine additional exhibits (AE C-AE K).
DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 10, 2015. 
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 47-year-old single woman with an adult daughter. Applicant is a
high school graduate and has earned two years of college credit over the years. (Tr. 14)
She is a U.S. Army veteran, having served on active duty from 1978 to 1995, and as a
reservist from 1995 to 2003. (Tr. 15) She was honorably discharged. 
Since 2007, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor as a network
engineer. (Tr. 16) She services routers and switches. She has held a clearance
continuously since 1988. (Tr. 16)
In 2009,  both of Applicant’s brothers lost their jobs. (Tr. 17) One of these
brothers has four children, and had been the sole income provider of his family before
losing his job. (Tr. 17) Consequently, Applicant decided to help both brothers financially.
(Tr. 17)
At the time when Applicant chose to help her brothers, she was already providing
financial assistance to her daughter, who was a then a private in the U.S. Air Force. (Tr.
18) Gradually, Applicant financially overextended herself and began falling behind on
her bills. She contacted creditors to discuss resolving debts, but “they weren’t
cooperative.” (Tr. 17) Subsequently, Applicant stopped paying many bills in their
entirety, “just kind of put[ting] them on the back burner until [she] could get back on
stable ground.” (Tr. 18)

By 2011, Applicant had incurred $16,000 of delinquent debt, including credit
cards (SOR subparagraphs 1.a - 1.d, 1.j), medical bills (SOR subparagraphs 1.e, 1.g,
and 1.k), a loan (SOR subparagraph 1.h), and multiple parking tickets (SOR
subparagraphs 1.l - 1.o).
SOR subparagraph 1.a, (duplicated in SOR subparagraph 1.i), totals $2,089. In
January 2015, Applicant contacted the creditor and negotiated a reduction in the payoff
amount to $900. (Tr. 21) She satisfied the balance by April 2015. (AE A at 1; AE C)
The debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.b, (duplicated in SOR subparagraph 1.f),
totals $2,279. Applicant contacted the creditor listed in SOR subparagraph 1.b in May
2015 to arrange a payment plan. (Tr. 21) Since then, she has been making $300
payments twice per month. (AE A at 2) By September 2015, she had completely
satisfied it. (AE J)
The debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.c totals $1,425. The creditor obtained a
judgement in 2011. Applicant satisfied this judgment through a wage garnishment. (AE
A at 3)
The debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.d totals $943. Applicant arranged to
satisfy this debt in three monthly increments in June 2015. By August 2015, she had
satisfied it entirely. (AE D)
The debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.e, totalling $54, is a medical bill.
Applicant paid this bill in April 2015. (AE E) 
SOR subparagraph 1.g is a medical bill totalling $1,464. Applicant organized a
payment plan in August 2015. She has been paying it in $215 increments since
September 2015. (AE B, AE F) The balance is approximately $1,000.
The debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.h, totals $7,979, Applicant opened this
loan to finance the renovation of her home in 2009. It became delinquent in 2010. (GE 2

SOR subparagraph 1.j, a credit card debt owed to a hardware store, totals $226.
It became delinquent in 2010. Applicant satisfied this debt in September 2015. (AE I)
SOR subparagraph 1.k is a delinquent hospital bill totalling $133, for emergency
room treatment received in early 2013. Applicant satisfied it later that year. (AE H)
SOR subparagraphs 1.l through 1.n are outstanding parking tickets totaling $265.
Applicant incurred them between 2009 and 2012. She paid them in 2013, shortly after
discovering they were still outstanding. (Tr. 27; AE H)
SOR subparagraph 1.o is a medical bill totalling $48. Applicant satisfied this debt
in 2013. (AE H)

Applicant earns $135,000 annually, and has approximately $750 of monthly
discretionary income. (Tr. 50) Her checking account has a balance of approximately
$4,000. (Tr. 47) In order to get control of her finances, she “had to make some pretty
tough calls in terms of not allowing [her] family to put [her] in a position that [she]
experience[s] financial issues of [her] own.” She no longer gives money to one brother,
and her daughter is thriving financially and needs no help. (Tr. 27) Although she still
helps her brother with the four children, she does so consistently within her budget. (Tr.
48)  
Policies
The adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating
conditions. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the
complexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the
adjudicative process. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,
past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b)
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel. . . .” The
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security
decision.
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
Under this guideline, “failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts,
and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about
an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.”
(AG ¶ 18) Between 2009 and 2011, Applicant incurred approximately $16,000 of
delinquent debt. AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c),
“a history of not meeting financial obligations,” apply. 
The following mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
5
 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control; and  
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or
otherwise resolve debts. 
Because Applicant could have chosen not to help her relatives, the resulting
financial difficulties she experienced cannot be attributed to circumstances beyond her
control. Nevertheless, she has satisfied all of her debts, except SOR subparagraph 1.g,
which she has been paying monthly since September 2015. She is only providing
financial assistance to one relative now, and that assistance is provided consistently
within her budget. She makes $135,000, has $750 in monthly, discretionary income,
and has a $4,000 checking account balance. I conclude that all of the mitigating
conditions, as set forth above, except for AG ¶ 20(b) are applicable. 
Whole-Person Concept
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge should consider the
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a). They are as follows: 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.
Applicant’s financial problems, at their core, stemmed from compassion - the
desire to help relatives - rather than overindulgence, or frivolous overspending on
material items. Consequently, these surrounding circumstances are to an extent
mitigating factors regardless of whether they were circumstances beyond her control. 
Also, Applicant’s honorable military service and maintenance of a security
clearance for nearly 30 years weigh in her favor. Upon considering this case in the
context of the whole-person concept, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the
security concern.

Formal Findings
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.o: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
