HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges 25 delinquent or charged-off 
debts and collection accounts totaling $35,768. She admitted responsibility for 22 
delinquent or charged-off debts and collection accounts totaling $34,980. Applicant did 
not provide sufficient evidence of progress paying or otherwise resolving her delinquent 
debts. Her eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 2, 2012, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86). (Item 3) On May 9, 2015, the Department of 
Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, 
pursuant to DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, and modified; DOD 
Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended 
(Regulation); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on 
September 1, 2006.    
 
The SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). (Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD was unable to find that it 
is consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility to 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
occupy a public trust position, which entails access to sensitive information. (Item 1) 
The DOD CAF recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether 
access to sensitive information should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On June 15, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and she 
requested a decision without a hearing. (Item 1) A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM), dated July 27, 2015, was provided to her on August 26, 2015.1 The 
FORM included six exhibits, which were admitted without objection. (Items 1-6) 
Applicant provided a timely response to the FORM. (pages (pg.) 1-33; Hearing Exhibit 
(HE) 1) The case was assigned to me on November 7, 2015. I issued a decision on 
November 21, 2015; however, I had not received and did not consider the documents 
Applicant provided in response to the FORM. (HE 1) Applicant did not provide notice of 
appeal to the DOHA Appeal Board. Department Counsel requested that I retain 
jurisdiction of Applicant’s case and consider Applicant’s FORM response. (HE 2) My 
decision of November 21, 2015, is vacated. I am considering Applicant’s FORM 
response and this case de novo.  Applicant was informed that the decision was vacated 
on November 30, 2015. (HE 1) 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a-1.j, 
1.m, and 1.o-1.y. (Item 2) She denied the other SOR allegations. She also provided 
mitigating information. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 55-year-old medical claims processor who has been employed by 
a defense contractor since 1989.3 In 1982, she graduated from college and received a 
bachelor’s degree. In 1989, she married her spouse. In 1993 and 1995, her children 
were born. She has never served in the military. She has held a public trust position for 
the previous 10 years. There is no evidence of felony or misdemeanor charges, alcohol 
abuse, use of illegal drugs, or rule violations. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s August 2, 2012 SF 86 disclosed five negative financial issues: (1) a 
charged-off credit card debt for $621—Applicant said she would “setup payment 
arrangements”; (2) an automotive collection account for $5,315—Applicant said she “will 
ask for settlement option”; (3) a charged-off credit card debt for $576—Applicant said 
                                            
1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated August 14, 2015, 
and Applicant’s receipt is dated August 26, 2015. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that she 
had 30 days after her receipt to submit information.  
 
2Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
3The source of the information in this paragraph and the next paragraph is Applicant’s August 2, 
2012 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of an application for a public 
trust position (SF 86). (Item 3) 
 
3 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
she “will ask for settlement plan”; (4) a charged-off credit card debt for $400—Applicant 
said she “will try and setup a payment plan”; and (5) a delinquent vehicle loan for 
$10,349 resulting after a voluntary vehicle repossession—Applicant said the vehicle 
was defective, and the creditor declined “to work with” her on resolution of this debt. 
 
Applicant’s SOR response addresses the SOR debts as follows: ¶ 1.a is a 
charged-off vehicle loan for $8,695—Applicant said her spouse was helping with 
payments until his hours were cut, and payments could not be afforded; ¶ 1.b is a 
delinquent debt for $7,327 resulting from repossession of a defective vehicle; ¶ 1.c is a 
charged-off debt for $6,990 resulting when payments were stopped after purchase of a 
defective vehicle; ¶ 1.d is a collection account for $922; ¶ 1.e is a collection account for 
$872; ¶ 1.f is a medical debt for $637; ¶ 1.g is a collection account for $426; ¶ 1.h-¶ 1.l 
are five medical-collection debts for $392, $180, $172, $100, and $92 that Applicant 
believes should have been paid by her insurance company; ¶ 1.m is a charged-off debt 
for $89; ¶ 1.n is a judgment for $596 that Applicant denied because she did not 
recognize it; ¶ 1.o is a collection account for $640; ¶ 1.p is a charged-off debt for $400; 
¶ 1.q is a collection account for $5,315, and Applicant said she was a cosigner for this 
account; ¶ 1.r is a collection account for $721; ¶ 1.s is a medical-collection debt for 
$278; ¶ 1.t is a medical-collection account for $224; and ¶ 1.u-¶ 1.y are five delinquent 
medical debts for $164, $164, $139, $139, and $94.   
 
Applicant explained in her June 15, 2015 SOR response: 
 
My plan in the future is to start paying something to these creditors, or 
maybe I will be given an opportunity to pay a portion of what’s owe[d] to 
them. Work out some type of agreement. I want to make this right. I pray 
to God that I will be given that chance. 
 
I love my job, I think the years should vouch for that (26 years). I enjoy 
what I do, and I have no intentions and never will of doing anything to 
make me lose my job here . . . I have no criminal record. Do not plan to 
start now.  
 
Although it may not appear this way; but I have no intentions of putting my 
job on the line after 26 years. I am a good person and I am an honest 
person. I just have a problem paying my bills and paying them on time. So 
if I am given the chance to improve on how I pay my bills, and I pray to 
God that I will be given the chance to do just that, even if I have to seek 
some financial counseling. After being on my job for 26 years, I would 
really be devastated if I lost my job. I can do better, and I will do better. I 
can be trusted. I can. Please consider giving me another chance. 
  
Applicant’s FORM response provided some evidence of progress on some of her 
debts: 
 
On September 21, 2015, the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.a ($8,695) noted the balance 
owed was $11,683 and offered to settle the debt for $4,000 to be paid by 36 monthly 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
payments of $111, starting on October 2, 2015. (pg. 13-14) On September 14, 2015, the 
creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.q ($5,315) wrote Applicant, noted the debt is not 
collectable because it is beyond the statute of limitations, and offered to settle the debt 
for six monthly payments of $25, starting September 18, 2015. (pg. 31) There is no 
evidence of payments to the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.q.   
 
On September 2, 2015, the creditor for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d ($922), 1.e 
($872), and 1.g ($426) wrote agreeing to a payment plan of $25 monthly for six months 
on each debt starting September 18, 2015. (pg. 18-26, 29-30) There is no evidence of 
payments to the creditor.   
 
Applicant said the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.o ($640) had three accounts. (pg. 3) On 
September 30, 2015, she paid one account for an unspecified amount, and she made 
arrangements to pay two accounts $25 monthly. (pg. 3, 12)    
 
Applicant said she contacted the medical creditor in SOR ¶¶ 1.s ($278), 1.v 
($164), 1.x ($139) and 1.y ($94). (pg. 4, 15-17) The medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.u ($164) is 
the same medical debt as in SOR ¶ 1.v ($164). (pg. 9) She provided a copy of her credit 
report, and indicated that the creditor was unable to locate any debts. (pg. 4)  
 
Applicant said she paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.m ($89) on September 30, 2015. 
(pg. 3-4, 28, 32-33) Applicant said she contacted the creditor for three non-SOR debts 
for $982, $965, and $4,065. (pg. 4) She agreed to send the creditor $25 monthly 
beginning on October 15, 2015. (pg. 4) She said she made payment arrangements on 
another non-SOR medical debt for $545. (pg. 4, 11)   
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The standard applicable to trustworthiness cases is 
that set forth in Egan, “regarding security clearances: such a determination ‘may be 
granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security’” ADP 
Case No. 14-00590 at 3 (Dec. 10, 2014) (citing Kaplan v. Conyers, 733 F.3d 1148 (Fed. 
Cir. 2013); ADP Case No. 12-04343 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2013)). The Government’s 
authority to restrict access to classified information applies similarly in the protection of 
sensitive, unclassified information. As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security or other sensitive 
information and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have 
access to such information. See Id. at 527.  
 
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”  
Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. “The standard that must be met for . . . 
assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s 
loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to 
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” Regulation ¶ 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the 
procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination 
may be made. See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, an 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of 
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the 
whole person. An administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial 
and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
sensitive information.   
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security and trustworthiness suitability. See 
ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance [or access to sensitive information].” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity 
clearance [or trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
The protection of the national security and sensitive records is of paramount 
consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national 
security.” This decision is based on national security and is not a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant.

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a trustworthiness 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant admitted 
responsibility for 22 delinquent or charged-off debts and collection accounts totaling 
$34,980. In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board 
explained the evidentiary-threshold weight given to credit reports in financial cases: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. (internal 
citation omitted).  
 
The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions. Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;4 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving her delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all of her SOR debts; however, she provided 
some mitigating information. She indicated her husband had some unemployment or 
underemployment, which constitutes a condition beyond her control. However, she did 
not provide details about how these circumstances affected the family finances. She 
denied responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.k ($100), 1.l ($92), and 1.n ($596), and I 
have credited her with mitigating these three debts. Applicant is also credited with 
successfully disputing the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.s ($278), 1.v ($164), 1.x ($139) 
and 1.y ($94) under AG ¶ 20(e). The medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.u ($164) is mitigated as a 
duplication.  
                                            
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

Applicant said the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.o ($640) had three accounts. On 
September 30, 2015, she paid one account for an unspecified amount, and she made 
arrangements to pay two accounts $25 monthly. Applicant paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.m 
($89). I am crediting Applicant with mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.m and 1.o.   
 
Applicant is credited with contacting the creditor for three non-SOR debts for 
$982, $965, and $4,065. She agreed to send the creditor $25 monthly beginning on 
October 15, 2015. She said she made payment arrangements on another non-SOR 
medical debt for $545. She is not credited with having an established payment plan with 
the creditors because she failed to provide proof of any payments made to the creditors.   
 
Applicant receives some credit for contacting the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
($8,695), 1.d ($922), 1.e ($872), 1.g ($426), and 1.q ($5,315), and obtaining settlement 
information; however, these five debts are not mitigated because she did not provide 
proof of any payments.    
 
Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances. Her August 2, 2012 
SF 86 disclosed delinquent debts, and she received ample notice of her delinquent 
debts raising trustworthiness concerns. There is limited financial documentation relating 
to her SOR creditors showing maintenance of contact with creditors before September 
2015,5 establishment of payment plans, disputes of debts, payments to creditors, or 
other evidence of progress or resolution of her SOR debts. She did not receive financial 
counseling. Mitigation is limited because there is insufficient evidence that her financial 
problems are being resolved, are under control, and will not recur in the future. Financial 
considerations concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
Applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
                                            
5“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s access to sensitive 
information. Applicant is a 55-year-old medical claims processor who has been 
employed by a defense contractor since 1989.  In 1982, she graduated from college and 
received a bachelor’s degree. She has held a public trust position for the previous 10 
years. Applicant is credited with mitigating the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.k through 1.o, 
1.s, 1.u, 1.v, 1.x, and 1.y. Her husband had some unemployment or underemployment, 
which damaged their finances to an unspecified extent. She expressed a positive 
intention to pay her debts. There is no evidence of felony or misdemeanor charges, 
alcohol abuse, use of illegal drugs, or security or rule violations. She contributes to her 
company and the Department of Defense.  
 
The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s access to sensitive 
information is more substantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial 
problems. She admitted responsibility for 22 delinquent or charged-off debts and 
collection accounts totaling $34,980. The proof of actual payments to her creditors is 
very limited. She failed to provide sufficient documentation of her progress resolving her 
financial problems, which shows lack of financial responsibility and judgment and raises 
unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
sensitive information. See AG ¶ 18. More evidence of financial progress is necessary to 
mitigate trustworthiness concerns. 
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s eligibility for 
a public trust position, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
public trust position. Unmitigated financial considerations concerns lead me to conclude 
that grant or reinstatement of a public trust position to Applicant is not warranted at this 
time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or 
will not attain the state of reform necessary to justify the award of a public trust position 
in the future. With more effort towards resolving her past-due debts, and a documented 
track record of behavior consistent with her obligations, she may well be able to 
demonstrate persuasive evidence of her worthiness for access to sensitive information.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. For the reasons stated, I 
conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to sensitive information at this time.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.j:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.k through 1.o:  For Applicant  
Subparagraphs 1.p through 1.r:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.s:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.t:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.u and 1.v:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.w:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.x and 1.y:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust 
position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.
