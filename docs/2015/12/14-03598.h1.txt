HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges a Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
discharge of her debts in 2004, failure to file state and federal tax returns from 2006 
through 2012, and 28 delinquent or charged-off debts and collection accounts totaling 
$15,604. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence of progress paying or otherwise 
resolving her delinquent debts. She did not file her federal and state tax returns from 
2006 through 2012. Her eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 28, 2013, Applicant signed and submitted an Electronic 
Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of an application for a 
public trust position (SF 86). (Item 2) On November 7, 2014, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant 
to DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, and modified; DOD 
Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended 
(Regulation); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on 
September 1, 2006.    
 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
The SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). (Item 1) The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to 
find that it is consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s 
eligibility to occupy a public trust position, which entails access to sensitive information. 
(Item 1) The DOD CAF recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether access to sensitive information should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked. 
 
On December 1, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and she 
requested a decision without a hearing. (Item 1) A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM), dated August 27, 2015, was provided to her on October 7, 2015.1 The 
FORM included five exhibits, which were admitted without objection. (Items 1-5) 
Applicant did not provide a response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on 
December 18, 2015.    
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant indicated “I admit” next to each of the SOR 
allegations in light pencil, or “I admit” may have been written and then partially erased. 
(Item 2) She wrote “unable to pay” under SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.g through 1.ee. (Item 2) Her 
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 48-year-old medical referral specialist who has been employed by 
a defense contractor since February 2013.3 In 1982, she married, and in 1996, she 
divorced. In 1997, she married, and in 1999, she divorced. In 2002, she married, and in 
2004, she divorced. In 2009, she married her spouse. Her children were born in 1982, 
1984, 1985, and 1989, and her step-daughter was born in 1968. She has never served 
in the military. She was unemployed from January to September 2010 because her 
elbow was injured. She has had periods of underemployment. There is no evidence of 
felony charges, alcohol abuse, use of illegal drugs, or rule violations. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s SOR allegations are as follows: ¶ 1.a is a Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
discharge of her debts in 2004; ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c are failures to file federal and state tax 
                                            
1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letters are dated September 1 
and 14, 2015, and Applicant’s receipts are dated October 6 and 7, 2015. The DOHA transmittal letter 
informed Applicant that she had 30 days after her receipt to submit information.  
 
2Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
3The source of the information in this paragraph is Applicant’s February 28, 2013 Electronic 
Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of an application for a public trust position 
(SF 86). (Item 2)

returns for 2006 through 2012;4 ¶ 1.d is an apartment-related collection debt for $4,135; 
¶¶ 1.f and 1.y are telecommunications collection debts for $1,188 and $216; ¶¶ 1.g, 1.i, 
and 1.m are bank collection debts for $775, $635, and $482;  ¶¶ 1.e, 1.h, 1.j, 1.v, 1.x, 
and 1.aa are collection debts of unspecified origin for $1,205, $661, $588, $754, $239, 
and $128; ¶¶ 1.k, 1.l, 1.n, 1.o through 1.s, 1.u, 1.w, 1.z, 1.bb through 1.ee, are medical 
collection or delinquent debts for $526, $494, $420, $129, $100, $49, $48, $27, $911, 
$241, $141, $105, $95, $82, and $61; and ¶ 1.t is a dental collection debt for $1,169.    
 
In Applicant’s March 20, 2013 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal 
subject interview (PSI), she described her history of delinquent debt, admitted the SOR 
debts, 2004 bankruptcy, and her and her husband’s failures to file their state and federal 
tax returns from 2006 through 2012. (Item 3) She described periods of 
underemployment and unemployment and medical issues. In 2010, Applicant and her 
spouse met with a tax advisor, who drafted federal tax returns for Applicant for 2006 
through 2009. (Item 3) The tax advisor told Applicant she owed $15,869 for her federal 
tax returns for tax years 2006 through 2009. (Item 3) They did not take further actions to 
address their taxes because her husband was receiving expensive cancer treatments, 
and she had medical problems or debts. (Item 3)    
 
Applicant’s FORM noted the absence of other mitigating information. The FORM 
explained that Applicant had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM “in which to submit a 
documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or 
explanation, as appropriate. If you do not file any objections or submit any additional 
information . . . your case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a 
determination based solely” on the evidence set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 2-3)  
 
 The DOHA letter conveying the FORM to Applicant reiterated that Applicant had 
a 30-day opportunity to submit evidence supporting her approval or continuation of 
access to sensitive information. Applicant did not file a response to the FORM.    
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
                                            
4The SOR did not allege that willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax may 
constitute a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense under 26 U.S.C. § 7203. See note 6, infra. In 
ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in 
which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: 
  
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). I have considered the non-SOR evidence related to this issue for the four purposes 
(reasons (b) to (e)), and not for any other purpose.

emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The standard applicable to trustworthiness cases is 
that set forth in Egan, “regarding security clearances: such a determination ‘may be 
granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security’” ADP 
Case No. 14-00590 at 3 (Dec. 10, 2014) (citing Kaplan v. Conyers, 733 F.3d 1148 (Fed. 
Cir. 2013); ADP Case No. 12-04343 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2013)). The Government’s 
authority to restrict access to classified information applies similarly in the protection of 
sensitive, unclassified information. As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security or other sensitive 
information and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have 
access to such information. See Id. at 527.  
 
Positions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as “sensitive positions.”  
Regulation ¶¶ C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. “The standard that must be met for . . . 
assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person’s 
loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to 
sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” Regulation ¶ 
C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the 
procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination 
may be made. See Regulation ¶ C8.2.1.  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, an 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of 
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the 
whole person. An administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial 
and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
sensitive information.   
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s trustworthiness suitability. See ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance [or access to sensitive information].” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity 
clearance [or trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
The protection of the national security and sensitive records is of paramount 
consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being 
considered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national 
security.” This decision is based on national security and is not a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant. 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a trustworthiness 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;” and “(g) failure to file annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required . . .” Applicant’s OPM PSI and 
credit reports establish a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge of her debts in 2004, failure to 
file state and federal tax returns from 2006 through 2012, and 28 delinquent or charged-
off debts and collection accounts totaling $15,604. In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained the evidentiary-threshold weight 
given to credit reports in financial cases: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. (internal 
citation omitted).

The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), 
and 19(g) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions. Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;5 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
                                            
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving her delinquent debt does not warrant full 
application of any mitigating conditions to all of her SOR debts; however, she provided 
some mitigating information. She is credited with mitigating the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a 
because discharge of her debts in 2004 under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code is not 
recent. Five circumstances beyond her control adversely affected her finances: (1) 
divorce; (2) unemployment from January to September 2010; (3) Applicant’s medical 
problems; (4) underemployment; and (5) her husband’s medical problems. However, 
she did not provide enough information about her income and expenses over the last 
three years to prove she acted responsibly under the circumstances.   
 
Applicant’s failure to file her state and federal tax returns for 2006 through 2012, 
and to show some progress towards paying her taxes raises the most significant 
trustworthiness concern. The federal government considers failure to file federal income 
tax returns important enough to warrant making that conduct a federal criminal offense 
under 26 U.S.C. § 7203.6 On November 7, 2014, the SOR was issued, and Applicant 
learned that her failure to file her federal and state tax returns raised a trustworthiness 
concern. She has not filed her tax returns.  
 
Applicant received ample notice of her delinquent debts raising trustworthiness 
concerns. There is no financial documentation relating to her SOR creditors showing 
maintenance of contact with creditors,7 establishment of payment plans, disputes of 
debts, payments to creditors, or other evidence of progress or resolution of her SOR 
debts. She did not receive financial counseling in the previous three years. Mitigation is 
                                            
626 U.S.C. § 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, provides:  
 
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this 
title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or 
supply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such 
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by 
law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a 
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 
($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, 
together with the costs of prosecution. 
 
7“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

limited because there is insufficient evidence that her financial problems are being 
resolved, are under control, and will not occur in the future. Financial considerations 
trustworthiness concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the 
Applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant’s access to sensitive 
information. Applicant is a 48-year-old medical referral specialist who has been 
employed by a defense contractor since February 2013. Five circumstances beyond her 
control adversely affected her finances: (1) divorce; (2) unemployment from January to 
September 2010; (3) Applicant’s medical problems; (4) underemployment; and (5) her 
husband’s medical problems. There is no evidence of felony charges, alcohol abuse, 
use of illegal drugs, or rule violations. 
 
The financial evidence against approval of Applicant’s access to sensitive 
information is more substantial at this time. Applicant has a history of financial 
problems. She failed to file state and federal tax returns from 2006 through 2012,8 and 
she has 28 delinquent or charged-off debts and collection accounts totaling $15,604. 
                                            
8The Appeal Board has recently reversed three grants of security clearances involving failures to 
file or pay federal income taxes. See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (stating “A 
security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national 
secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an 
applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.”); ISCR Case No. 14-
01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); 
ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (noting not all tax returns were filed, and an 
insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens).

Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence of progress paying or otherwise resolving 
her delinquent debts, which shows lack of financial responsibility and judgment and 
raises unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect sensitive information. See AG ¶ 18. More evidence of financial progress is 
necessary to mitigate trustworthiness concerns. 
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s eligibility for 
a public trust position, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
public trust position. Unmitigated financial considerations concerns lead me to conclude 
that grant or reinstatement of a public trust position to Applicant is not warranted at this 
time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or 
will not attain the state of reform necessary to justify the award of a public trust position 
in the future. With more effort towards resolving her past-due debts and her tax issues, 
and a documented track record of behavior consistent with her obligations, she may 
well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her worthiness for access to 
sensitive information.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, the Regulation, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of 
the whole person. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. For the reasons 
stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to sensitive information at this 
time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.b through 1.ee: Against Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust 
position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.
