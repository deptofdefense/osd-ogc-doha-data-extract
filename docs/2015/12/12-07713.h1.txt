METZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:
Based on the record in this case,  Applicant’s clearance is granted.1
On 12 May 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a Statement
of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial
Considerations.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the2
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 4
March 2015, and I convened a hearing 8 April 2015. DOHA received the transcript 16
April 2015.

Findings of Fact
Applicant denied the SOR financial allegation. He is a 61-year-old security
specialist employed by a U.S. defense contractor since March 2012. He was previously
employed in a similar position with another contractor from December 2010 to March
2012. He was unemployed from September-December 2010 and from February-
September 2004. He seeks to retain the clearance he has held, as needed, since about
1988. He has been a security specialist all his career, both in the military and for
defense contractors.
Applicant entered the U.S. military in June 1987, enlisting in a state active
reserve unit. He served honorably until February 2004, when he was medically
discharged because of injuries he sustained while on deployment in support of military
operations begun in the wake of the September 2001 terrorist attacks. He was three
years from achieving regular retirement, but he began receiving irregular retired pay in
December 2014 (Tr. 53). He began receiving $376 monthly disability payments in 2005;
he currently receives $472 monthly (Tr. 50). His three adult children from his second
marriage and a grandchild live with him and his wife.
Applicant first married in June 1974. He and his first wife separated in September
1983, but he remained married to her because she became ill and he wanted her to
retain the benefits he was able to provide her. When he divorced her in April 1991, he
was already in a relationship with his second wife, whom he married in August 1991.
They have been married over 24 years.
When Applicant was medically discharged from the military in February 2004, he
lost his non-taxable allowances and his access to free medical care, as well as his
military pay. After nine months unemployment, the job he obtained paid only $30,000
annually, a significant pay cut from his military service. In the six years he was
employed by this Government contractor, he received periodic pay raises: to $55,000,
$60,000, and then $70,000. When the contract ended in September 2010, he was
making $70-75,000 annually. However, during his unemployment and the period of
lower pay in his early years with the company, Applicant estimates he spent about
$60,000 in savings to augment his reduced salary.
Although Applicant was only unemployed from September to December 2010,
the job he obtained paid only $60,000 annually, another significant pay cut. He moved
to his current employer in March 2012, at a starting salary of $85,000. He currently
earns $92,000 annually. His wife makes about $35,000 annually working for the state
Government. Applicant also now receives about $15,000 annual retired pay.
The SOR alleges, and Government exhibits substantiate, that Applicant filed for
Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in June 2013, listing $482,000 in liabilities, of which
almost $166,000 was unsecured. The reorganization plan was ultimately confirmed in
February 2014, obligating Applicant to pay almost $135,000 over five years (Answer;
Applicant’s bankruptcy petition (GE 4) clearly shows the $482,000 total liabilities. The bankruptcy court3
ordered Applicant to pay the trustee “the lump sum total of $10,769.21 for a period of 8 (sic) months . . .
$2,295 for 4 (sic) months and then $2,395 for 48 months for a total of 60 months.” (Answer) Applicant’s
assertion miscalculates the amount to be collected, based in part on the poor wording of the order.  If
Applicant paid $10,769.20 per month for each of eight months, he would indeed pay over $210,000 to the
trustee over 60 months. However, as is clear from Applicant’s payment records with the trustee (Answer,
Enclosure B), Applicant was to pay an aggregate $10,769.20 (lump sum) by the end of February 2014 (eighth
month), followed by the stated monthly payments over the next 58 months.
Although not reflected in the bankruptcy records, the court must have understood that while Applicant had4
sought and received a wage order for $1,600 monthly before confirmation of the plan, he was paying weekly
to the trustee. The court must also have understood that Applicant had paid the trustee over $12,000 by the
time the plan was confirmed. Consequently, the 20 February 2014 confirmation and pay orders reflect a lump-
sum payment followed by 52 monthly payments.
Applicant’s payment records for the trustee reflect a new weekly payment of $552.69. That amount is the5
required weekly amount necessary to make 12 monthly payments of $2,395. Similarly, although Applicant
made two larger payments in July 2013 to cover the initial court-ordered $1,600 monthly payment, the
subsequent weekly payments show the required payment of $369.23 to pay $1,600 monthly, and the required
payment of $529.62 to pay $2,295 monthly.
Applicant’s total payments of $21,321.19 between late July 2013 and early July 2014 are greater than the6
$19,949.20 due to have been paid by this time under the court’s confirmation order.

GE 2-4). Applicant denied the SOR allegation because he incorrectly believed that he
did not have $482,000 in liabilities, and was obligated to pay $210,000.  3
Later in June 2013, Applicant filed a motion to make payments before his plan
was confirmed. On 27 June 2013, the court approved a wage order of $1,600 monthly
(GE 3). Unfortunately for Applicant, his initial plan was denied, with leave to amend, on
14 August 2013, 10 October 2013, and 11 December 2013. Applicant filed four
amended plans before he ultimately received confirmation on 20 February 2014.
Concomitant with the confirmation, the court issued a wage order for $2,295 monthly.4
On 17 June 2014, the court issued another wage order for $2,395 monthly (Answer,
Enclosure C).  Applicant must make this monthly payment until approximately June5
2018.6
Applicant attributes his financial problems largely to his service-related injury,
which resulted in his medical discharge from the military, nine months’ unemployment,
and ongoing expenses no longer covered by the military. His financial problems were
exacerbated when he become unemployed, and when each new job after being
unemployed came with a significant pay cut.
Applicant received financial counseling as part of his bankruptcy process. He has
made all his required bankruptcy payments—another approximately $21,000 from July
2014 through March 2015. Two work references from a previous contractor employment
(one from the company; one from the Government agency) consider him honest and
trustworthy and recommend him for his clearance (Answer). There is no record of any
security violations during any time he held a clearance. Moreover, the Government
He obtained permission from the court to buy a new car, with a monthly payment that was within the amount7
approved by the court (Tr. 48-49). However, he was ultimately unable to keep up the payments and
surrendered the vehicle to the lender. He bought a used car at auction and is in the process of getting it into
working order.

produced no credit reports or other evidence to suggest that Applicant has had any
ongoing financial problems since undertaking his bankruptcy.7
Policies
The adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person’s suitability
for access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and
mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.
Each decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the
factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,
conclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case
can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to
classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,
the relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).
Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s security clearance. The Government
must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,
the burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s case.
Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden
of persuasion.
Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a
compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,
reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.
The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard compels resolution of any
reasonable doubt about an applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the Government.8
Analysis
The Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, but
Applicant mitigated the security concerns. Applicant’s medical discharge in February
2004, unemployment from February-September 2004, underemployment for a period
after September 2004, and unemployment from September-December 2010 created
financial problems for him.9
         
¶ 20 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that10
it is  unlikely to recur . . . 
¶ 20 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control . . . and11
the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
¶ 20 (c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications12
that the problem is being resolved or is under control;
¶ 20 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.13

The mitigating factors for financial considerations give Applicant substantial aid.
While his financial difficulties are both recent and multiple, his employment is much
more stable. His income has been recently augmented by his retirement pay,
suggesting that the circumstances that caused his financial problems are less likely to
recur.  Further, his financial problems were largely due to circumstances beyond his10
control, and he acted responsibly trying to keep his finances in order before deciding,
with advice of counsel, that a Chapter 13 financial reorganization was the most sensible
way to resolve his debt.11
 
Applicant received financial counseling as part of his bankruptcy petition in June
2013, and he acted to begin plan payments before the plan was confirmed.  Indeed, he12
satisfied the plan requirement for a lump-sum payment by the time the plan was
confirmed. Moreover, he met the next plan goal by the time he answered the SOR. His
continued plan payments since constitute a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. As of
the date of the hearing, he had paid about $42,000 of his required payments.  The13
Appeal Board has stated that an Applicant need not have paid every debt alleged in the
SOR, need not pay the SOR debts first, and need not be paying on all debts
simultaneously. Applicant need only establish that there is a credible and realistic plan
to resolve the financial problems, accompanied by significant actions to implement the
plan.  Applicant’s efforts to date constitute such a plan, and his consistent payments on14
his bankruptcy plan—before the SOR was issued—reflect significant actions. Finally,
Applicant’s record of military service, his record of appropriate handling of classified
information in the past, and the favorable work and character references he provided
establish a strong “whole person” analysis in favor of granting Applicant’s clearance. I
conclude Guideline F for Applicant.

Conclusion
Under the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant. Clearance granted.
