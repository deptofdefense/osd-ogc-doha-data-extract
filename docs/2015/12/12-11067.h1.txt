GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 29, 2012, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On September 8, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued her a set of interrogatories. She 
responded to the interrogatories on October 27, 2014.2 On July 16, 2015, the DOD CAF 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended 
and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the

Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information 
(December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations 
made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security 
concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the 
DOD CAF was unable to make an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. On August 29, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to 
have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the 
Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant on September 
23, 2015, and she was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt 
of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as 
well as the Guidelines applicable to her case. According to Department Counsel, 
Applicant purportedly received the FORM on October 1, 2015, but there is no receipt in 
the case file to confirm that fact. A response was due by October 31, 2015. On 
November 4, 2015, Applicant submitted information and documentation which 
addressed the allegations. Department Counsel did not object to the submitted 
documents. The case was assigned to me on December 10, 2015.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.g.). Applicant’s 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is 32 years old. Her current employment status is unclear, for since she 
completed her e-QIP in May 2012, she has changed jobs on several occasions. She 
held a position as a data entry operator, through a temporary staffing company, with a 
state agency from February 2012 until June 2012. She also held unspecified positions 
with two successive companies until sometime before November 2015, and now 
apparently is unemployed awaiting a security clearance.3 She has never held a security 
clearance.4 A June 2001 high school graduate,5 Applicant received a bachelor’s degree 
in an unspecified discipline in May 2005.6 She has never served in the U.S. military.7 
She has never been married.8 Applicant is a single mother.9

Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant has experienced several periods of unemployment over the years: May 
2011 until September 2011 (with the exception of one week in August 2011); April 2010 
until October 2010; June 2007 until November 2007; and May 2005 until November 
2005. During other periods, she held a number of different jobs or attended school.10 
During her periods of unemployment, Applicant either received unemployment 
compensation or was supported by her parents or a friend.11 It is unclear when 
Applicant first experienced financial difficulties, but in reviewing her June 2012 credit 
report,12 as well as her comments to an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM)13 it appears that a number of delinquent accounts existed as far 
back as 2007. Applicant had student loans, automobile loans, credit cards, multiple 
cellular telephone accounts, and charge accounts with clothing stores and jewelry 
stores. Applicant stated her financial problems commenced in 2007 when she became 
unemployed and had insufficient funds to pay her debts after spending her available 
funds on “car insurance, rent, cable, cell phone and her credit cards.”14 
 
The SOR identified seven purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, totaling 
approximately $42,151, which had been placed for collection, charged off, or became 
judgments. Those debts and their respective current status, according to the June 2012 
credit report, an August 2014 Equifax credit report,15 an April 2015 Equifax credit 
report,16 Applicant’s comments to the OPM investigator, her Answers to Interrogatories, 
her Answer to the SOR, and her Response to the FORM, are described as follows:  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a. – This is a $2,000 bank line of credit with a high credit of $2,403 that 
was placed for collection and charged off in 2008. A subsequent law suit was filed 
against Applicant, and a judgment in the amount of $2,443 was entered in 2009.17 
Applicant contends she negotiated with the creditor to pay $20 per month, but that after 
purportedly making payments for two to three months, she stopped doing so and chose

to direct her available funds to pay her car loan and car insurance.18 Applicant failed to 
submit any documentation to support her contention that she had a repayment 
agreement or that she made any payments to the creditor. On November 4, 2015, 
approximately six years after the judgment was entered, Applicant sent an e-mail to the 
creditor offering to make monthly payments of $25 until the account is paid.19 There is 
no evidence of a reply being received or a payment having been made. The account 
has not been resolved. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b. – This is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $386 that was 
placed for collection in August 2012.20 Applicant acknowledged that when she was 
paying her medical bills she overlooked this particular one. She intended to contact the 
creditor to resolve the account.21 She contended she recently entered into repayment 
arrangements with the creditor,22 but she failed to specify the arrangements or submit 
any documentation to support her contentions or any possible payments. The account is 
still listed in her November 2015 TransUnion credit report.23 The account has not been 
resolved. 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c. and 1.e. – Applicant obtained student loans from various sources 
that were eventually serviced by organizations other than the original lending 
institutions. While Applicant was enrolled in school at least half-time, or during periods 
of unemployment, loan repayment deferments were authorized to temporarily stop 
payments on the loans. During periods when she incurred temporary problems repaying 
her student loans but was not eligible for deferment for reasons such as financial 
hardship and illness, she could apply for forbearance to reduce or postpone payments. 
Some of her student loan deferments expired and various loans were placed for 
collection.  
 
One such loan, opened with SallieMae, now known as Navient, in December 
2004 in the original amount of $31,474.73 (SOR ¶ 1.c.), became delinquent in August 
2008. By August 2014, the unpaid balance had increased to $34,895, and the amount 
past due was $15,740.24 By April 2015, the unpaid balance had increased to $36,113, 
with a past-due balance of $17,387. The creditor eventually charged off $21,106.25

 Item 4, supra note 16, at 2. The SOR erroneously alleged the charged-off amount as $36,113, but the 
credit report reported the amount as $21,106. 
 
5 
                                      
 
The SOR also alleged a separate student loan, opened in January 2010 
(approximately five years after Applicant had already received her degree) with a high 
credit of $31,474 (SOR ¶ 1.e.), that became delinquent in December 2014. By April 
2015, the unpaid balance had increased to $34,251, with a past-due balance of $407.26 
By November 2015, the unpaid balance had increased to $34,967, with a zero past-due 
balance.27  
 
A closer inspection of the “two” student loans reveals that they are, in fact, one 
student loan as reflected during different time periods as reported by the lending 
institution and the servicing company. On October 28, 2015, the servicing company 
verified that the student loan with the original amount of $31,474.73, and a current 
principal balance of $34,967.06 was placed into forbearance from September 1, 2015, 
until December 31, 2015.28 Upon the termination of the forbearance period, within a 
matter of days from this Decision, Applicant will be expected to start making her monthly 
payments on this and the other two student loan accounts that are currently in 
forbearance. For reasons discussed below, it is unclear if Applicant will be able to start 
resolving the alleged student loan account. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d. – This is a national clothing store charge account with a credit limit of 
$200 that was placed for collection and charged off for $710 in March 2011.29 The 
account was sold to another lender, identified in the SOR. The debt purchaser 
increased the past-due balance to $887.30 Applicant acknowledged using the account to 
purchase clothing, but found herself unable to maintain her payments. During her July 
2012 OPM interview, she stated she would resolve the account within the next two 
years.31 She failed to do so. The account has not been resolved. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f. – This is a cellular telephone account that Applicant opened in her 
name for the benefit of her aunt and two cousins. At some point, they failed or refused 
to pay their share of the expenses and the account, with a past-due balance of 
approximately $1,572, became over 120 days past due, and was placed for collection.32 
The account was subsequently sold to a debt purchaser.33 In May 2012, Applicant 
stated she would “work on arranging some form of payment plan with the collector

soon,”34 but as of July 2015, the account remained delinquent. The account has not 
been resolved. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g. – This is another cellular telephone account that Applicant opened in 
her name for the benefit of her cousin. At some point, her cousin failed or refused to pay 
her share of the expenses and the account, with a past-due balance of approximately 
$341, became over 120 days past due, and was placed for collection.35 The account 
was subsequently sold to a debt purchaser.36 In May 2012, Applicant stated she would 
“work on arranging some form of payment plan with the collector soon,”37 but as of July 
2015, the account remained delinquent. In August 2015, Applicant claimed to be trying 
to work out payment arrangements,38 but she failed to indicate with whom those efforts 
were being made. The account has not been resolved. 
 
In October 2014, Applicant furnished a personal financial statement. Her net 
monthly income was approximately $2,136; her monthly household expenses totaled 
$2,347; and her monthly debt payments were zero, leaving her with a monthly deficit of 
approximately minus $211.39 Applicant’s financial situation has deteriorated since she 
submitted her personal financial statement because she now has a child and is 
unemployed. Thus, while she now receives financial assistance under the Special 
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC),40 she no 
longer receives a salary. In October 2014, Applicant wrote a financial advisor to inquire 
about the services that could be provided to improve her credit situation.41 There is no 
evidence that the financial advisor ever responded to the inquiry, or that Applicant ever 
received financial counseling. As recently as her response to the FORM, Applicant 
offered little evidence to indicate that her financial problems are now under control. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”42 As Commander in Chief,

the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”43   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”44 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.45  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”46 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”47 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant has had a long-standing problem with her finances which 
started as early as 2007. She had insufficient funds to continue making her routine 
monthly payments. Various accounts became delinquent, and were placed for 
collection, charged off, or went to judgment.  AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
    
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of

employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”48  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply. AG ¶ 20(b) minimally applies. The 
nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties since about 
2007 make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” 
Applicant attributed her financial problems generally to being periodically unemployed 
and recently added the fact that she is now a single mother. She offered no 
explanations as to why she had so many automobile loans, credit cards, and charge 
accounts with clothing stores and jewelry stores. She did explain why she had multiple 
cellular telephone accounts for the benefit of various family members, but she failed to 
demonstrate what actions she has taken to obtain the necessary funds from them to 
pay her accounts. Applicant did offer evidence that she notified the creditor regarding 
her delinquent student loans, because they were placed into forbearance from 
September 1, 2015, until December 31, 2015. I have credited her with mitigating her 
student loan debt because it was in forbearance until this week. Applicant has offered 
no documentary evidence of a good-faith effort to resolve any of her other delinquent 
debts. She essentially ignored them, and seemingly continues to do so.  
 
There is no evidence to indicate that Applicant ever received financial 
counseling. Based on what she reported in her personal financial statement in October 
2014, Applicant had a monthly deficit of minus $211. The overwhelming evidence is that 
Applicant’s financial problems are not under control, and that her financial situation has 
deteriorated even more since she submitted her financial statistics. Applicant has not 
acted responsibly by failing to address her delinquent accounts while employed and by 
making limited efforts of working with her creditors.49 Applicant’s actions under the

 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case

circumstances confronting her cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and 
good judgment.50 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.51   
     
There is little evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. She has 
declared her intentions of bringing her accounts current and repaying them.  
 
The disqualifying evidence is more substantial. Applicant has repeatedly 
declared her intentions of bringing her accounts current and repaying them, but to date, 
she has not. Instead, Applicant has continued to ignore those delinquent accounts; and, 
while still employed, she had a monthly budget deficit of minus $211. Applicant offered 
no evidence as to her reputation for reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. 
Applicant’s long-standing failure over the years to voluntarily repay her creditors, even 
in the smallest amounts, or to arrange even the most reasonable payment plans, 
reflects traits which raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. There 
are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are not under control. 
Applicant’s actions under the circumstances cast doubt on her current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. Considering the absence of confirmed debt 
resolution and elimination efforts, Applicant’s financial issues are likely to remain.

attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:52 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of ‘“meaningful track record” necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated an essentially negative track record of voluntary 
debt reduction and elimination efforts, generally ignoring her delinquent debts. Overall, 
the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her financial 
considerations concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:    Against Applicant

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
