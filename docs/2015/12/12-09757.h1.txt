HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s credit reports and statement of reasons (SOR) alleged three unpaid 
judgments and 15 collection or charged-off accounts totaling $32,016. All of her SOR 
debts are resolved, except for four debts totaling $6,418. She is diligently endeavoring 
to resolve the last four SOR debts. She established a track record of debt payment and 
resolution. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. Access to 
classified information is granted.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On March 23, 2012, Applicant completed and signed an Electronic 
Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 
1) On January 20, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 
10865,  Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
 
2 
                                         
 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the 
SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. 
  
On February 23, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR, and she requested a 
hearing. On August 20, 2015, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On 
September 14, 2015, the case was assigned to me. On September 25, 2015, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the 
hearing for October 19, 2015. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered 7 exhibits, and Applicant offered 
11 exhibits, which were admitted into evidence without objection. (Transcript (Tr.) 11-16; 
Government Exhibit (GE) 1-7; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-K) On October 27, 2015, DOHA 
received a copy of the transcript of the hearing. On November 19, 2015, Applicant 
offered 10 additional exhibits, which were admitted without objection. (AE L-U) On 
November 19, 2015, the record closed. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 
1.e, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.l through 1.r. (HE 3) She denied the remaining SOR allegations, and 
she also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are 
accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor, who is an engineer 
assisting with information technology (IT) certifications. (Tr. 17, 61) She earned a 
bachelor’s degree in management information systems. (Tr. 19) She used student loans 
to fund her college education. (Tr. 19-20) In 2003, she experienced unemployment and 
underemployment after college. (Tr. 20, 22) She has had steady employment since 
2004. (Tr. 40) In 2005, her roommate moved out, and payment of rent became 
problematic. (Tr. 22-23) She had expensive car repairs. (Tr. 24) In 2010, she had to 
move abruptly because of a burglary of her apartment. (Tr. 26-27, 56-57) She lost about 
$1,500 after receipt of restitution after the burglary. (Tr. 41) She provided family 
members about $15,000 over the last ten years. (Tr. 41-43, 57) In 2004, she received a 
security clearance, and there are no allegations of security violations or abuse of 
alcohol or illegal drugs. (Tr. 21; GE 1) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant’s monthly gross income is $8,462. (Tr. 28; AE H) She has a remainder 
of about $2,000 at the end of each month. (Tr. 29) She has investments totaling about 
$30,000. (AE H) Over the last six years, her raises have averaged about two percent 
annually. (Tr. 44) 
 
Applicant’s credit reports and SOR showed three judgments and 15 collection or 
charged-off accounts totaling $32,016, and their status is as follows: 
 
 
3 
                                         
 
SOR ¶ 1.a is a collection account originating from a bank for $7,922. On 
February 6, 2015, Applicant paid $4,000 resolving this debt. (Tr. 29-30, 45-46; AE A) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b is a collection account originating from a bank for $7,355. She 
believed the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b were duplications of each other. (Tr. 58) On 
March 2, 2015, the creditor wrote that the debt was transferred to a collection company. 
(AE B) On October 22, 2015, the collection company wrote that the account has a zero 
balance. (Tr. 30, 47; AE U) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c is a charged-off bank debt for $2,722. On February 7, 2015, March 9, 
2015, and April 7, 2015, Applicant made $454 payments to the creditor. (Tr. 30-31, 47; 
AE D) Applicant said the debt was paid. (Tr. 30-31) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d is a collection account originating from a bank for $929. On October 
13, 2015, the collection company wrote thanking Applicant for her payment and stating 
the account had a zero balance. (AE D) The status of the account is “satisfied.” (Tr. 31-
32, 48; AE D)     
 
SOR ¶ 1.e is a collection account originating from a bank for $606. On February 
9, 2015, the bank wrote that the debt was paid, and the account had a zero balance. 
(Tr. 32, 48; AE E)  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.f through 1.h are three judgments filed in 2009, which are owed to a 
corporation and total $4,356 for rent in 2008-2009. (Tr. 32-35, 48-49, 59-60) The 
creditor has gone out of active business. (AE S) A county attorney told Applicant to file a 
motion with the court along with three checks in the judgment amounts and to ask the 
court to vacate the judgments. (AE S) Applicant filed the three checks with the court. 
(AE Q, R) Applicant has sufficient funds in her account to cover the checks. (AE S) Her 
court date is November 25, 2015. (AE L)   
 
SOR ¶ 1.i is a collection account originating from a bank for $4,147. (Tr. 35-37, 
49-51) On November 13, 2015, the creditor offered to settle the debt for $2,448; and on 
November 17, 2015, Applicant paid the settlement amount. (AE I; AE M; AE N)        
 
SOR ¶ 1.j is a collection account originating from a bank for $558. (Tr. 51) On 
November 17, 2015, Applicant paid the creditor $558 resolving the debt. (AE P) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.k is a collection account originating from a bank for $2,062. Applicant 
did not recognize the account. (Tr. 51) On September 15, 2015, Applicant wrote the 
creditor asking for information on the account. (Tr. 39, 52; AE I) She did not receive a 
response to her request for information, and she believed the company might be out of 
business. (Tr. 52)  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.l through 1.q are six debts totaling $735 owed to a local government 
entity for $105; $200; $205; $55; $105; and $65 for parking tickets. On February 6, 
2015, Applicant paid her debt to the local government entity. (Tr. 38, 53; AE G)  
 
 
4 
                                         
 
SOR ¶ 1.r is a collection account originating from a bank for $622. On November 
18, 2015, the creditor wrote that the credit reporting companies would be notified that 
the status of the account would be changed to “Charged Off, Paid in Full.” (AE T) 
 
Applicant received financial counseling, and she provided several certificates 
from an on-line counseling service. (Tr. 38; AE K) She delayed paying some of her 
debts because she was focused on paying down her student loans and her vehicle loan. 
(Tr. 54)  Applicant’s October 21, 2014 credit report shows several debts that have been 
paid or are current, including student loans totaling $53,974. (GE 2) She has paid her 
student loans down to $39,000. (AE L) She is current on her taxes, her $20,000 vehicle 
loan, and her other debts. (Tr. 56; AE L) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
A friend and character witness, who has known Applicant for seven years, 
described her as loyal, honest, reliable, trustworthy, and dependable. (Tr. 70-71) She 
recommended continuation of Applicant’s security clearance. (Tr. 71) 
 
Coworkers, who have known Applicant for from 15 months to 6 years, and a 
friend, who has known her for 20 years, describe her as professional, reliable, diligent, 
loyal, helpful, and trustworthy. (AE J) Their letters support continuation of Applicant’s 
security clearance. (AE J)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
 
5 
                                         
 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this 
decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt 
 
6 
                                         
 
is documented in her credit reports, SF 86, SOR response, and hearing record. 
Applicant’s SOR alleges, and the evidence establishes three judgments and 15 
collection or charged-off accounts totaling $32,016. The debts in SOR ¶ 1.a ($7,922) 
and ¶ 1.b ($7,375) are duplications of each other, and the delinquent SOR debt total is 
$24,659. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;1 and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
                                            
1The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   
 
7 
                                         
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a) through 20(d) apply, and 20(e) applies to the three judgments in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.f through 1.h ($4,356) owed to a corporation for rent in 2008-2009 and SOR ¶ 
1.k ($2,062). She denied responsibility for these four debts, and she has taken 
reasonable actions to resolve or investigate them.  
 
In 2003, Applicant experienced unemployment and underemployment. In 2005, 
her roommate moved out, and payment of rent became problematic. She had expensive 
car repairs. In 2010, she had to move abruptly because of a burglary of her apartment. 
She provided family members about $15,000 over the last ten years. These are all 
circumstances beyond her control which adversely affected her finances. She received 
financial counseling. All of her SOR debts are resolved or disputed.     
 
Based on Applicant’s credible and sincere promise to timely pay her debts, future 
delinquent debt “is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on [Applicant’s] current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” and “there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control.” Her payments of her debts showed good 
faith. She has sufficient income to keep her debts in current status. Her efforts are 
sufficient to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Even if Applicant 
provided insufficient information to mitigate security concerns under AG ¶ 20, she 
mitigated security concerns under the whole-person concept, infra. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
 
8 
                                         
 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor, who is an engineer 
assisting with IT certifications. She earned a bachelor’s degree in management 
information systems. Her income was adversely affected by unemployment, 
underemployment, the loss of her roommate’s share of the rent, expensive car repairs, 
the burglary of her apartment, and financial support of her family. Several friends and 
coworkers described her as loyal, honest, reliable, trustworthy, professional, diligent, 
and dependable. Their statements support continuation of Applicant’s security 
clearance. There is no evidence of any security or employment rule violations, alcohol 
abuse, use of illegal drugs, or criminal conduct. 
 
All but four of her SOR debts are resolved. Applicant has filed a motion with the 
court to vacate or dismiss the three judgments in SOR ¶¶ 1.f through 1.h ($4,356) owed 
to a corporation for rent in 2008-2009, and she has proffered the funds to the court to 
pay the judgments. She has written the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.k ($2,062) seeking 
information on the debt.  
 
 Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances by aggressively working to 
resolve her debts. Her 2014 credit report indicates her two largest debts, her student 
loan and vehicle loan are current. She understands that she needs to pay her debts, 
and the conduct required to retain her security clearance. The Appeal Board has 
addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating:  
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence 
of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant 
is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  
 
9 
                                         
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted). Applicant has established a “meaningful track record” of debt 
payment, and I am confident she will maintain her financial responsibility. 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.r:  For Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
