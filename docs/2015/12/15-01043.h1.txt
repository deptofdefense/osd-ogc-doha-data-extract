GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 1, 2014, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On August 5, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial

Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on August 17, 2015. On August 29, 2015, Applicant 
responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative 
judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on 
September 29, 2015. The case was assigned to me on October 13, 2015. A Notice of 
Hearing was issued on October 15, 2015, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on 
October 27, 2015.2 
 
 During the hearing, 3 Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 3) and 11 Applicant 
exhibits (AE A through AE K) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on November 5, 2015. I kept the record open 
to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity. She 
timely submitted a number of documents, which were marked as AE L through AE O, 
and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on November 10, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.f.).3 Applicant’s answers are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been an 
analyst since December 2003.4 Applicant attended college over a multi-year period, 
sometimes attending part-time, and sometimes full-time, generally while working. She 
received a bachelor’s of science degree in June 1992.5 She has never served with the 
U.S. military.6 She has held a secret security clearance since 2005.7 She has never 
been married.8

 It should be noted that Department Counsel and Applicant had previously spoken by telephone as to the 
potential dates for the hearing, and although the Notice of Hearing had been issued on October 15, 2015, scheduling 
the hearing for October 26, 2015, that Notice was apparently not timely received by Applicant. On October 26, 2015, 
it was determined that Applicant was not yet present to commence the hearing, but was on her way to the hearing 
location. Rather than having her appear in a hurried manner, she was offered the option to appear the following day 
with her witnesses and evidence. Applicant accepted that opportunity. The hearing was postponed for one day. Upon 
convening the hearing, Applicant expressly waived any potential defects in notice, and she agreed to proceed. See 
Tr. at 12-14.

 During the proceeding, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by withdrawing ¶ 1.f. because it 
duplicated the allegation in ¶ 1.a. There was no objection to the motion. The motion was granted, and the SOR was 
amended in the manner described. Tr. at 21-22.

Financial Considerations 
It is unclear when Applicant first started having issues with her finances. The 
combination of high tuition fees, expensive student loans, under-employment, and 
unexpected household problems, all contributed to her financial situation. While initially 
working and going to school, she earned from $4 to $6 per hour. She funded her own 
inexpensive community college tuition and costs, but later, upon transferring to a more 
expensive state college, she sought the assistance of student loans and grants. She 
estimated she spent $30-$35,000 of her own money and obtained student loans of 
approximately $20-$25,000.9 In 1994, when her father passed away, Applicant moved 
into the family home, and she has resided there with her mother since that time. She 
contributes to the mortgage payments. Applicant has been faced with a panoply of 
unexpected problems including severe termite issues requiring extensive remediation, 
an old air conditioner that had to be replaced for approximately $10,000, and plumbing 
problems.10   
Applicant’s financial situation improved when her annual salary increased from 
approximately $60,000 to about $90,000. She now earns over $40 per hour. She 
monitored her credit reports and noticed several errors. Seeking to clean up her credit 
record, Applicant engaged the professional services of a credit repair service company. 
She paid the company approximately $600, and a number of errors were removed from 
her credit reports and other credit-reporting errors were corrected.11 It is unclear if 
Applicant received any financial counseling regarding budgeting, debt consolidation, or 
debt repayment plans. She shifted away from her use of credit cards, recently paid off 
one card, and is paying down the remaining cards.12 She filed her income tax returns for 
the last three years on time, and received small refunds.13  
On November 10, 2015, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement 
which reflected a monthly net income of $4,069.74; normal monthly expenses of 
$2,352.36; and monthly debt payments of $1,374.23. Her net monthly remainder was 
$343.15, available for discretionary savings or spending.14

The SOR, as amended, identified five purportedly delinquent debts that had been 
placed for collection, as reflected by an August 2014 credit report15 and a July 2015 
credit report.16 Those debts, totaling approximately $46,594, and their respective current 
status, according to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by the Government and 
Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described below. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b.): These are a direct unsubsidized consolidated student 
loan account with a high credit of $29,616 and a past-due balance of either $39,024 or 
$39,466; and a direct subsidized consolidated student loan account with a high credit of 
$4,451 and a past-due balance of $5,807. They were placed for collection in 2014 and 
transferred.17 The loans were in deferment and forbearance before entering an apparent 
default status. Applicant actually had been making monthly payments by automatic, 
electronic transfers, of $250 prior to January 2013. The payments increased to $300 per 
month on January 31, 2013; to $370 per month in January 2014; and to $400 per month 
in January 2014.18 For some unexplained reason, her payments were not reported to 
the credit reporting agencies.19 The student loan data report furnished by the National 
Student Loan Data System for Students (NSLDS) does not reflect the current status of 
the student loan accounts.20 Nevertheless, it appears that the accounts are in the 
process of being resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): This is a bank credit card with a credit limit of $250 and a high 
credit of $441 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser in 2009 after 
Applicant was involved in an automobile accident and out of work for several weeks.21 
The debt purchaser increased the unpaid balance, first to $841, and then to $878.73.22 
Applicant contacted the debt purchaser and it was agreed that Applicant would pay 
$878.73, on or before January 31, 2016, to satisfy and close the account.23 Applicant 
contends she started making unspecified payments in September 2015, but she had not 
yet reached the goal of paying the account off.24 The account is in the process of being 
resolved.

(SOR ¶1.d.): This is an automobile loan with a high credit of $34,461 and 
remaining balance of $22,888 that became two months past due in February 2015, but 
was never placed for collection.25 Applicant fell behind in her payments when she had to 
prioritize her allocation of funds first to the two major appliances and a new air 
conditioner in her residence.26 She resumed making payments in June 2015, and the 
account is now current.27 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): This is a department store charge account with a credit limit of 
$165 and high credit of $433 that was reported as charged off in the amount of $433 in 
August 2008.28 The report was in error. Applicant had paid the account on August 18, 
2008, seven years before the SOR was issued.29 The account has been resolved.  
Work Performance and Character References 
 Applicant’s supervisor said that Applicant “significantly exceeds in her 
performance within our group. She is dependable and provides accurate and quality 
reporting. [Applicant] works independently and uses good judgment in her decision 
making.”30 Applicant has also served as a mentor for other employees, and their 
feedback is generally four or five out of the best five, and in some cases, “firewall” 
fives.31 The former branch operations manager of the bank where Applicant previously 
worked also had very positive things to say about her: “[Applicant] has always displayed 
professionalism, honesty, and a good work ethic. . . I can vouch for her character or 
anything else that you need me to confirm.”32 A coworker, who has known Applicant 
since high school, has great respect for Applicant and has witnessed Applicant as a 
strong team player.33 Applicant’s mother is effusive in her praise for Applicant. She 
characterized Applicant as dependable, reliable, and trustworthy. They have joint bank 
accounts. “[Applicant] has been a big help. I know that whenever I need her she’s there. 
She usually just takes over, takes care of things. She is just a - - she’s a good 
daughter.”34

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”35 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”36   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”37 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.38  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”39 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”40 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. While it appears that Applicant may have had some isolated 
instances when she was unable to maintain all of her monthly payments, it is unclear 
when or if Applicant’s financial situation deteriorated to the point where she established 
a history of not doing so. Two accounts (an auto loan and a credit card) and possibly a

student loan became delinquent. AG ¶ 19(a) has been established. AG ¶ 19(c) has not 
been established.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”41 Under AG ¶ 20(e), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where 
“the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt 
which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the 
basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
AG ¶¶ 20 (a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) apply. Applicant’s financial problems 
were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending. The nature, frequency, and 
recency of Applicant’s isolated financial difficulties facilitate the conclusion that those 
financial issues occurred “so long ago” and they were “infrequent.” Applicant was faced 
with a number of unexpected household problems including severe termite issues 
requiring extensive remediation, an old air conditioner that had to be replaced for 
approximately $10,000, and plumbing problems. She also referred to two major 
appliances that required attention. She was involved in an automobile accident and was 
out of work for several weeks. Those circumstances were substantially beyond her 
control. Applicant was briefly forced to prioritize her monthly payments because of an 
inability to make the normal payments. Now that the financial situation has improved 
and stabilized, it appears that Applicant’s unanticipated financial issues occurred under 
such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur.  
                                                          
41
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating 
condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

Applicant monitored her credit reports and noticed several errors. She engaged 
the professional services of a credit repair service company, and through their joint 
efforts, a number of errors were removed from her credit reports and other credit-
reporting errors were corrected. Applicant contacted her known creditors and it was 
determined that her student loans, which had been in deferment and forbearance, and 
possibly in default, were not being accurately reported as being paid over a multi-year 
period. One department store charge account was erroneously reported as charged off, 
when in reality, it had been paid off in 2008, seven years before the SOR was issued. 
An automobile loan was at one point two months past due, but Applicant resumed her 
monthly payments in June 2015, two months before the SOR was issued, and that 
account is now current. Only one account alleged in the SOR has not yet been fully 
resolved. Applicant started making payments in September 2015, and the account is 
expected to be paid off by January 2016. Applicant has no other delinquent accounts. 
With a net monthly remainder of $343.15 available for discretionary savings or 
spending, there are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under 
control. Applicant’s actions, under the circumstances confronting her, no longer cast 
doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.42 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.43       
There is a paucity of evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Some of 
her accounts became periodically delinquent.

The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant has an outstanding reputation in the workplace. Applicant may have had 
some isolated instances when she was unable to maintain all of her monthly payments, 
but it does not appear that Applicant’s financial situation deteriorated to the point where 
she established a history of not doing so. Instead, Applicant was faced with a number of 
unexpected household problems and an automobile accident that required that she 
prioritize her monthly payments. She had errors removed from her credit reports, and 
other credit-reporting errors were corrected. It was determined that her student loans 
were not being accurately reported as being paid over a multi-year period. Another 
account was incorrectly reported as charged off, when in fact it had been paid off, seven 
years before the SOR was issued. Applicant has resolved all but one of her debts, and 
that one is expected to be resolved by January 2016, as payments commenced in 
September 2015. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are 
under control. Her actions under the circumstances confronting her do not cast doubt on 
her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 44 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.f:    Withdrawn 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
