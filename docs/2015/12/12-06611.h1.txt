GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 14, 2012, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On July 21, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued him a set of interrogatories. He 
responded to the interrogatories on September 3, 2014.2 On April 4, 2015, the DOD 
CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended 
and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information

(December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations 
made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security 
concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why the 
DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on April 22, 2015. On May 12, 2015, Applicant 
responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative 
judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on 
June 16, 2015. The case was assigned to me on July 9, 2015. A Notice of Hearing was 
issued on July 31, 2015, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August 26, 2015. 
 
 During the hearing, five Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 5) and one 
administrative exhibit were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. 
The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 3, 2015. I kept the record open to 
enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity. He 
timely submitted a number of documents, which were marked as Applicant exhibits (AE) 
A through AE J and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on 
September 24, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.h.). Applicant’s answers are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a 
technician working with hazardous material, including supplies and waste, since early 
2014.3 A June 1987 high school graduate,4 Applicant subsequently completed some 
online courses, but chose not to complete the requirements for a degree.5 He has held 
a secret security clearance since May 1987.6 Applicant was married in May 1991.7 He 
has two daughters, born in 1996 and 2000, respectively.8

Military Service 
 
Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy in June 1987, and he served on active duty 
until he retired honorably as a Petty Officer First Class (E-6) in June 2009.9 During his 
military service, he was awarded the Navy/Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the 
Navy/Marine Corps Achievement Medal (five awards), the Navy “E” Ribbon (four times), 
the Good Conduct Medal (seven awards), the National Defense Service Medal (two 
awards), the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (two awards), the Global War on 
Terrorism Service Medal, the Armed Forces Service Medal, the Sea Service 
Deployment Ribbon (four times), the Navy/Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal, the 
Overseas Service Ribbon, the NATO Medal, the Pistol Marksmanship Ribbon, and the 
Coast Guard Special Operation Ribbon.10 
 
Financial Considerations 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until his retirement in June 
2009. He had taken a two-week “superficial” transition assistance class in order to 
anticipate potential problems that might arise after retirement. The class did not discuss 
financial issues, such as financial planning or budgeting, but instead focused on writing 
a resume.11  His wife, until then a stay-at-home mom, returned to the work force.12 
Unable to find suitable post-retirement employment on a full-time basis, Applicant 
obtained part-time employment in July 2009.13  
Applicant’s transition into his naval retirement turned into a big culture shock. He 
was used to making $6,000 per month while on active duty, and his income, including 
his retirement income, plummeted down to $3,000 or $4,000 per month.14 Because of 
his status while on active duty as a geographical bachelor aboard ship, Applicant’s wife 
routinely handled the family finances. In June 2010, he found his wife crying because 
money was tight and they were unable to maintain their monthly payments. She had 
been unable to come to any agreements regarding the potential settlement of accounts 
because they had insufficient funds at the end of the month to be able to do so.15 
Although he briefly considered bankruptcy to resolve his financial problems, he

abandoned that option because he wanted to resolve his debts by setting up repayment 
plans.16 
In early August 2014, eight months before the SOR was issued, Applicant went 
to the base support center and received approximately three hours of financial 
counseling on budgeting and debt-resolution.17 One week later, on August 16, 2014, 
Applicant entered into a debt resolution agreement with a debt-relief company in an 
effort to negotiate agreeable settlements and make repayment arrangements with his 
creditors. He agreed to make a monthly program deposit. He initially listed four creditors 
in the program, with an estimated $19,438 in debts at the time.18 He anticipates adding 
two additional accounts to the program once the initial ones are resolved.19 Under the 
debt resolution program, Applicant has $213 automatically deducted from his bank 
account every two weeks.20 Since the commencement of his program, until as recently 
as August 2015, Applicant has made $2,770 in payments to one or more of his 
creditors.21  
The SOR identified eight delinquent debts that had been placed for collection or 
charged off, as reflected by a February 2012 credit report,22 a June 2014 credit report,23 
and a January 2015 credit report.24 Those debts, totaling approximately $46,054, and 
their respective current status, according to the credit reports, other evidence submitted 
by the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are 
described below. 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): This is a line of credit account with a credit limit of $7,000 and a 
past-due balance of $6,925 that was placed for collection in early 2014.25 Applicant 
contacted the creditor and authorized recurring payments, but when other expenses 
took priority (such as a new clutch in his automobile), those payments ceased. The 
account became further delinquent, and it was eventually charged off.26 In June 2015, 
the creditor offered to settle the account, which by then had increased to approximately

$7,452. The options offered included a payment of approximately $2,608 within 30 days 
of the offer.27 He was unable to accept the offers at the time. This account is one of the 
two accounts Applicant intends to add to the debt-resolution program once the initial 
ones are resolved. The account is not yet in the process of being resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This is a credit card account with a credit limit of $10,000 and a 
past-due balance of $10,524 that was placed for collection in early 2014.28 Applicant 
contacted the creditor, the same one holding the line of credit, and after making some 
payments, his other issues arose, and those payments ceased. The account became 
further delinquent, and it was eventually charged off.29 In July 2015, the creditor offered 
to settle the account, which by then had increased to approximately $10,545. The 
options offered included a payment of approximately $4,745 within 30 days of the 
offer.30 He was unable to accept the offers at the time. This account is the other one of 
the two accounts Applicant intends to add to the debt-resolution program once the initial 
ones are resolved. The account is not yet in the process of being resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): This is a credit card with a credit limit of $8,200 and a remaining 
past-due balance of $613 that was placed for collection and charged off.31 Because the 
debt was considered an indebtedness to the government, an allotment was set up and 
various amounts have been withheld from his military retirement payment each month:32 
in July 2014, it was $184.50;33 in August 2014, it was $123.50;34 and as recently as 
August 2015, it was $193.79.35 Because of the nature of the indebtedness, the creditor, 
the source of the funds, and the method of payment, it appears that the account is in the 
process of being resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): This is an unspecified type of bank account with a credit limit of 
$7,509 and a past-due balance of $8,043 that was placed for collection and charged 
off.36 The creditor agreed to settle the account for $3,600.37 The account is one of the 
four accounts listed in Applicant’s debt-resolution program for which he has $213

process of being resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): This is a bank credit card issued on behalf of a home-improvement 
store with a credit limit of $3,246 and a past-due balance of $4,616 that was placed for 
collection and charged off.39 The creditor agreed to settle the account for $2,033.40 The

purchaser.42 The account is one of the four accounts listed in Applicant’s debt-resolution 
program for which he has $213 automatically deducted from his bank account every two 
weeks.43 The account is in the process of being resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): This is another bank credit card with a credit limit of $1,092 
(subsequently increased to $1,108) and a past-due balance of $2,324 (later increased 
to $2,461) that was placed for collection, charged off, and sold to a debt purchaser.44 
The account is one of the four accounts listed in Applicant’s debt-resolution program for 
which he has $213 automatically deducted from his bank account every two weeks.45 
The account is in the process of being resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.h.): This is an indebtedness to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for 
unpaid income tax for the tax years 2010 and 2011 in the respective amounts of 
$277.51 and $1,333.38, or a combined total of $1,610.89.46 Applicant had timely filed 
his income tax returns online with a nationwide tax preparation service. In completing 
his returns for those years, Applicant entered information in the incorrect blocks, 
resulting in a repeated error.47 When the IRS eventually informed him of the errors,

Applicant entered into an installment agreement with the IRS under which, between 
February 2014 and April 2014, he paid the IRS $600.48 An overpayment of $3,176 for 
the tax year 2014 was applied to his unpaid income tax balances (including penalties, 
interest, and other charges), and as of August 2015, the unpaid balance was 
$1,671.58.49 The account is in the process of being resolved. 
In August 2014, Applicant completed a Personal Financial Statement which 
reflected a net monthly family income of $5,735; normal monthly expenses of $3,040; 
and mortgage and other financial obligations of $2,186. His net monthly remainder was 
approximately $527, available for discretionary savings or spending.50 His more recent 
budgeting worksheet reflects similar, but not identical, data.51 
Work Performance and Character References 
 A former coworker, whose relationship has evolved into a friendship, 
characterized Applicant as professional, respectful, helpful, easygoing, and honest, with 
a positive work ethic.52  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”53 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”54   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information.

An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”55 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.56  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”57 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”58 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to

2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a “history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems arose shortly after his retirement in 
2009. He was unable to continue making his routine monthly payments. Various 
accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection or charged off. He 
mistakenly underpaid his federal income tax for a two-year period. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”59  
                                                          
59
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person

Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
but he apparently did spend beyond his newly-established post-retirement means. The 
nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties make it 
difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” Instead, as 
noted above, Applicant’s financial problems started shortly after his retirement from the 
U.S. Navy in June 2009, occasioned by culture shock and his unanticipated decrease in 
salary due to his brief period of unemployment, subsequent underemployment, and the 
loss of benefits associated with active duty. Those were circumstances that were 
substantially beyond his control. Applicant’s wife, the family member who usually 
handled the family finances since Applicant frequently resided aboard ship while on 
active duty, was forced to prioritize their monthly payments because of an inability to 
make the normal payments. Now that the financial situation has stabilized and the 
issues clarified, it appears that Applicant’s unanticipated financial issues occurred under 
such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur.  
To his credit, upon learning of the situation, Applicant took control over the 
perilous financial situation. He went to the base support center and received financial 
counseling on budgeting and debt resolution. Shortly thereafter, before the SOR was 
issued, he entered into a debt-resolution agreement with a debt-relief company in an 
effort to negotiate agreeable settlements and make repayment arrangements with his 
creditors. Applicant has $213 automatically deducted from his bank account every two 
weeks to address four specific debts. Another debt is paid by allotment and various 
amounts have been withheld from his military retirement payment each month. 
Applicant entered into an installment agreement with the IRS and made payments 
under that agreement. Applicant’s overall repayment strategy has been successful, and 
he is in the process of resolving most of his delinquent debts. There are clear 
indications that Applicant’s financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions, 
under the circumstances confronting him, do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.60 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating 
condition].

(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.61       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His apparent 
naïveté regarding his post-retirement finances, as well as his failure to secure a full-time 
job before actually retiring, along with his continued pre-retirement spending level, 
resulted in various accounts becoming delinquent. He erroneously underpaid his federal 
income tax. Accounts were placed for collection or charged off.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. A 
decorated naval retiree, Applicant has an outstanding reputation in the workplace and in 
the community in which he has resided. Upon learning of his financial situation, 
Applicant commenced a course of conduct to address and resolve it. He received 
financial counseling, entered into a debt-resolution agreement, set up settlement 
agreements, and has continuing repayment arrangements with his creditors. Routine 
periodic repayments are currently made to his creditors. Applicant is in the process of 
resolving most of his delinquent debts. There are clear indications that Applicant’s 
financial problems are under control. His actions under the circumstances confronting 
him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the

Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 62 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant

  Subparagraph 1.g:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.h:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
