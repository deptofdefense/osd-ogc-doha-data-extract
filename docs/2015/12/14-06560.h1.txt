GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 9, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On February 11, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial

Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on February 23, 2015. On February 27, 2015, 
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have his case decided on 
the written record in lieu of a hearing. However, on a subsequent unspecified date, he 
changed his decision and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.2 
Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on July 21, 
2015. The case was assigned to me on July 22, 2015. A Notice of Hearing was issued 
on July 31, 2015, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August 24, 2015. 
 
 During the hearing, one administrative exhibit, three Government exhibits (GE) 1 
through GE 3, and nine Applicant exhibits (AE) A through AE I were admitted into 
evidence without objection. Applicant and one witness testified. The transcript (Tr.) was 
received on September 1, 2015. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to 
supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity. He timely submitted a 
number of documents, which were marked as AE J through AE N and admitted into 
evidence without objection. The record closed on September 14, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted three of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a., 1.c., and 1.d.). Applicant’s answers are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 43-year-old former employee of a defense contractor. He had been 
a computer field technician from April 2014 until January 2015, when he was “let go,” 
subject to recall, because his security clearance was “inactivated.”3 The recall period 
has expired.4 He has been unemployed and seeking permanent employment since 
January 2015.5 A June 1987 high school graduate,6 Applicant subsequently completed 
some college coursework, but has not completed the requirements for a degree.7 He 
held a secret security clearance from October 2002 until January 2015, and once held

the position of security manager for his unit.8 Applicant was married in November 1996.9 
He has no children. 
 
Military Service 
 
Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in March 1992, and he served on active 
duty until he was honorably discharged in July 1999.10 In March 2000, he enlisted in the 
Air National Guard (ANG) where he remained until June 2008 when he returned to the 
U.S. Air Force.11 He retired honorably as a Master Sergeant (E-7) in January 2013.12 
During his military service, he was awarded the Air Force Meritorious Service Medal, 
the Air Reserve Forces Meritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, the Air 
Force Commendation Medal with one oak leaf cluster, the Air Force Achievement Medal 
with one oak leaf cluster, the Air Force Good Conduct Medal with two oak leaf clusters, 
the National Defense Service Medal with one service star, the Air Force Outstanding 
Unit Award, the Air Force Organizational Excellence Award with three oak leaf clusters, 
the  Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Humanitarian Service Medal, the Air 
Force Longevity Service Ribbon with two oak leaf clusters, the Armed Forces Reserve 
Medal with one hourglass device, the Air Force Training Ribbon, and the Air Force 
Professional Military Education (PME) Graduate Ribbon with one oak leaf cluster.13 
 
Financial Considerations 
A review of Applicant’s June 2011 credit report reveals some isolated 
delinquencies as far back as 2005.14 There was nothing unusual about his finances until 
about 2010. He and his wife had purchased a mobile home in 1997 for approximately 
$36,000, and they resided in it for about 10 years, when they decided to purchase a 
new starter home that seemed more affordable to them. Applicant’s wife’s sons and 
niece rented the mobile home from them and continued to reside in it for several years. 
The sons moved out, and then the niece decided that she could no longer afford 
residing in the mobile home. Applicant sought to either rent or sell the mobile home. The 
mobile home park upon which the mobile home was located refused to permit a non-
family member to reside in the mobile home, thus thwarting any opportunity to rent the 
mobile home. No “for sale” signs were permitted making it difficult to sell. At the time, 
Applicant was paying $400 per month for the mortgage and $200 per month for the

trailer park space. It would have cost Applicant approximately $5,000 to relocate the 
mobile home, but that amount simply was too much for him to handle. Applicant 
contacted the creditor but nothing could be worked out, so Applicant agreed to 
voluntarily relinquish it. The mobile home was repossessed in June 2010 and eventually 
sold for $9,800. The creditor demanded approximately $21,000 to pay off the loan. A 
repayment plan was rejected by the creditor. The balance was charged off in July 2010. 
Applicant sought guidance from a financial advisor at a bank. Based on the known facts, 
the financial advisor said it would be in Applicant’s best interest if he did not settle the 
account with the creditor because the statute of limitations would expire and the account 
would be removed from his credit report by March 2017. Applicant followed that advice 
and focused on reducing or paying off credit cards and auto loans.15  
The SOR identified four purportedly delinquent debts that had been placed for 
collection or charged off, as reflected by the June 2011 credit report,16 and an August 
2014 credit report.17 Those debts, totaling approximately $21,843, and their respective 
current status, according to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by the 
Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, are described 
below. 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): This is the mortgage loan for the mobile home discussed above. 
Upon learning of the SOR focus on this and other accounts, Applicant again contacted 
the creditor in an effort to establish a repayment plan. Although the current balance on 
the account was listed as $21,066, the creditor offered to settle it for one payment of 
$5,000, an amount that Applicant could not accumulate because of his unemployment 
status. Also required by the creditor was a “financial hardship letter” explaining 
Applicant’s current financial status.18 In September 2015, Applicant proposed a lump-
sum settlement for $3,000, and noted that the statute of limitations had already expired. 
In anticipation of some sort of agreed settlement, Applicant withdrew $10,375.96 from 
his Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) to enable him to resolve this one remaining delinquent 
account.19 No response from the creditor has yet been received. Nevertheless, the 
account is in the process of being resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This is an automobile loan with a high credit of $14,548 and 
remaining balance of $397 that was placed for collection, charged off, and sold to a debt 
purchaser.20 Applicant denied the allegation and contacted the creditor in an effort to 
resolve it. Applicant contends that he paid off the car loan in 2005 and received the title.

He traded the vehicle to a used car dealer in 2007.21 The account does not appear in 
his August 2014 credit report22 or in his February 2015 credit report.23 Applicant called 
the creditor when he learned of the alleged delinquent status of the account, but the 
creditor had no recollection of any remaining unpaid balance.24 It appears that the 
account was resolved in 2005, ten years before the issuance of the SOR. 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): This is a cellular telephone account with a high credit and a 
remaining past-due balance of $265 that was placed for collection and charged off in 
January 2007.25 Applicant contended that the account was paid in full as of February 2, 
2007. The account does not appear in his August 2014 credit report26 or in his February 
2015 credit report.27 The creditor acknowledged that the account had been previously 
paid in full.28 It appears that the account was resolved in 2007, eight years before the 
issuance of the SOR. 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): This is a cellular telephone account with a high credit and a 
remaining past-due balance of $115 that was placed for collection and charged off in 
May 2011.29 The account was sold to a debt purchaser in August 2011.30 Applicant 
contended that the account was paid in full August 17, 2012, and Applicant’s August 
2014 credit report confirms that the account was paid before October 2012.31 The debt 
purchaser and its attorney have confirmed that the debt has been paid.32 The account 
does not appear in his February 2015 credit report.33 It appears that the account was 
resolved in 2012, three years before the issuance of the SOR. 
In August 2015, Applicant met with a financial counselor at the military facility’s 
Airman and Family Readiness Center to prepare an action plan. They reviewed his

finances, developed a budget, and prepared a financial strategy.34 Applicant receives a 
net monthly military retirement income of $2,018.35 He does not collect unemployment 
compensation.36 Applicant’s wife has two jobs. She has been a waitress for over 20 
years and a hairdresser for over 18 years. Depending on the number of hours she 
works, Applicant’s wife may earn between $1,000 and $3,000 per month.37 When he 
was still employed in 2014, Applicant was grossing around $80,000 per year, and his 
monthly net income from that job alone was approximately $2,466.38 His normal monthly 
expenses are approximately $4,001, and his consumer debt obligations are $875.39 
Because of the fluctuation of his wife’s income, it is unclear if there is a net monthly 
remainder available for discretionary savings or spending. Applicant’s credit score 
dropped to 575 at one point. However, since May 2014, Applicant’s credit score has 
improved from approximately 650 to 689 in February 2015.40 Despite his present 
unemployment status, Applicant is continuing to pay his bills. 
Work Performance and Character References 
 A retired major has known Applicant for approximately a decade. He was at one 
point a branch chief with Applicant serving as a member of the branch. They worked 
very closely for several years until the major retired and became a civil servant. Their 
work relationship required interaction with both classified, unclassified, and sensitive 
information. The major always found it a “greater risk to not include [Applicant]. His 
ability to lead, his integrity, never in question. I mean I couldn’t have gotten the things I 
got - - accomplished without him.” Although Applicant is no longer working for him, they 
continued to see each other professionally when Applicant was providing his office with 
professional services. Applicant’s honesty and integrity were never in doubt.41  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”42 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national

security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”43   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”44 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.45  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”46 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”47 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems arose shortly after his “tenants” 
vacated his rented mobile home in 2010 and he relinquished it in a voluntary 
repossession. He was unable to pay the remaining balance on the mobile home or 
continue making some routine monthly payments on other accounts. Some accounts 
became delinquent and were placed for collection or charged off. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) 
apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
                                                          
46

9 
                                      
 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”48  
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply.  Applicant’s financial problems were 
not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending. Those problems essentially started 
because his mobile home tenants left it, and Applicant’s efforts to seek new tenants 
were thwarted by the trailer park when it refused to permit him to rent to non-family 
tenants. Applicant’s efforts to sell the mobile home were made more difficult when he 
was not permitted to place a “for sale” sign near the mobile home. He could not move 
the mobile home because he did not have enough money saved to do so. Faced with 
continuing mortgage payments and trailer park payments, Applicant chose to voluntarily 
relinquish the mobile home to the creditor as a repossession. Following the guidance of 
a bank financial advisor, Applicant focused on reducing or paying off credit cards and 
auto loans. Applicant’s financial difficulties were exacerbated when, relying in large part 
on some erroneous or otherwise incorrect information appearing in his credit report, the 
DOD CAF revoked his security clearance, and Applicant’s employer subsequently fired 
him. All of those factors detailed above were circumstances that were substantially 
beyond his control.  
Applicant took control over the financial situation. He met with a financial 
counselor to prepare an action plan. The counselor reviewed Applicant’s finances, 
developed a budget, and prepared a financial strategy. Applicant has been negotiating 
with the mobile home creditor over a lengthy period, and the original demand for 
approximately $21,000 has been reduced to $5,000. Applicant has tendered an offer to 
the creditor for $3,000, even though the statute of limitations has expired. As to the 
other purportedly delinquent debts listed in the SOR, the automobile loan (SOR ¶ 1.b.) 
was actually resolved in 2005, ten years before the SOR was issued; the cellular 
telephone account (SOR ¶ 1.c.) was actually resolved in 2007, eight years before the 
                                                          
48
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating 
condition].

SOR was issued; and the other cellular telephone account (SOR ¶ 1.d.) was actually 
resolved in 2012, three years before the SOR was issued. Under normal circumstances, 
there would be clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems would be considered 
to be under control. But these are not normal circumstances because Applicant has 
been unemployed for nearly one year based on the information appearing in the SOR. 
Nevertheless, while there is still the outstanding mobile home debt (now reduced to a 
somewhat insignificant amount), Applicant is seemingly able to keep to his action plan. 
Applicant’s actions, under the circumstances confronting him, do not cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.49 
Security clearance adjudications are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The 
adjudicative guidelines do not require an applicant to establish resolution of each and 
every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve 
financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no 
requirement that an applicant immediately resolve or make payments on all delinquent 
debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in an SOR be 
paid first. Rather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the 
payment of such debts one at a time.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.50

There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. His apparent 
naïveté regarding his trailer park rights and obligations pertaining to tenants and “for 
sale” signs, as well as his failure to more timely address the deficiency balance from his 
repossessed mobile home, especially while still employed, resulted in various accounts 
becoming delinquent. Accounts were placed for collection or charged off.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. A 
decorated Air Force retiree, Applicant has an outstanding reputation for honesty and 
integrity in the workplace. He received financial guidance from the local bank and then 
financial counseling at the military facility. His finances were reviewed, an action plan 
was prepared, along with a budget, and a financial strategy was developed. He is 
negotiating with the mobile home creditor to finally resolve the delinquent debt. Despite 
his current unemployment, routine monthly payments are currently made to his 
creditors. Applicant had previously resolved three of his four SOR-related delinquent 
debts years before the SOR was issued. Notwithstanding Applicant’s current 
unemployment, there appear to be clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems 
are under control. His actions under the circumstances confronting him do not cast 
doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 51 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I

conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
