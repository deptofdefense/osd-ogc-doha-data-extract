GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 9, 2014, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On May 19, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial

Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. On June 11, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government 
was prepared to proceed on July 16, 2015. The case was assigned to me on October 5, 
2015. A Notice of Hearing was issued on October 28, 2015, and I convened the hearing 
as scheduled on November 16, 2015. 
 
 During the hearing, three Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 3) and six 
Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE F) were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on November 23, 2015. I kept the 
record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of that 
opportunity. He timely submitted a number of documents, which were marked as AE G 
through AE P, and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on 
November 30, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.i.). Applicant’s answers are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a 
game tester, and now an associate producer, since March 2014.2 He is a May 2003 
high school graduate.3 Applicant subsequently attended three different colleges, 
primarily online, but chose not to complete the requirements for a degree.4 He enlisted 
in the U.S. Army in September 2006, but was honorably discharged in June 2007 for a 
medical condition, not a disability.5 It is unclear if he was granted a security clearance 
when he entered military service.6 Applicant was married in December 2007 and 
divorced in March 2011.7 He has custody of his daughter, born in 2008.8

Financial Considerations 
It is unclear when Applicant first started having issues with his finances. He was 
briefly unemployed for one to three months in 2007 (while caring for his pregnant wife), 
2008 (while caring for his sick mother-in-law), and 2009 (after relocating and caring for 
his daughter).9 His ex-wife does not contribute any child support.10 From 2009 until he 
obtained his current position in 2014, he had no health insurance. He had panic 
disorder with agoraphobia – essentially an anxiety disorder that he had to deal with a 
number of years. Those issues are now under control with medication. With substantial 
medical bills arising from his medical conditions at the end of each month, he was living 
paycheck-to-paycheck and had no funds remaining to address some of his accounts.11 
Applicant made “a lot of stupid decisions” in his early 20s. He failed to understand the 
consequences of debt, failed to take his financial issues seriously enough, and did not 
fully appreciate the importance of financial stability and debt management. 
Nevertheless, he prioritized his needs with food, shelter, and the security and care of his 
daughter at the top of his list.12 As a result, accounts became delinquent and were 
placed for collection.  
The situation improved for two reasons. First, when Applicant was hired by his 
current employer, his annual salary improved significantly from approximately under 
$18,000 to $35,000, and shortly thereafter to $45,000. It is between $46,000 and 
$47,000 at the present time.13 In June 2015, Applicant estimated he had $200 to $300 
remaining each month for discretionary saving or spending. That amount diminished 
when his cohabitant, who had an annual salary of $33,000, lost her job and Applicant 
started assisting her financially.14 She was expected to start her new job two weeks 
after the hearing.15 Second, Applicant started taking classes with the Dave Ramsey 
Financial Peace University. He considered himself financially naïve, and the classes 
taught him all the financial information he should have known before he turned 30. He 
learned about mortgages, checking accounts, credit scores, handling debts, collections, 
and budgeting.16 Armed with his new knowledge, Applicant contacted, or attempted to 
contact, his known creditors to see if repayment arrangements could be made.17 He set

up a proposed debt repayment plan, listing an anticipated debt repayment schedule.18 
His student loans were placed in forbearance from deferment, and he intends to start 
making monthly payments on those as well.19  
A dramatic event occurred after the hearing. Applicant’s mother reminded him of 
the existence of a mutual fund – an emergency fund – that had been set up for him 
when he graduated from high school and was under the custodial care of his aunt.20 
Within a matter of days, the account was cashed out, and Applicant’s uncle, using the 
available funds, paid several creditors in full.21 
The SOR identified nine delinquent debts that had been placed for collection, as 
reflected by an April 2014 credit report.22 Those debts, totaling approximately $17,327, 
and their respective current status, according to the credit report, other evidence 
submitted by the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding 
same, are described below. 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): This is a medical account with a past-due balance of $446 that was 
placed for collection and listed with Experian.23 Applicant was unable to identify the 
creditor. The account is not listed in Applicant’s November 2015 TransUnion credit 
report24 or his November 2015 Equifax credit report.25 When Applicant attempted to 
obtain an Experian credit report on line, the response was that a condition exists that 
prevented Experian from accepting the request at the time.26 Applicant has made 
unsuccessful efforts to identify the creditor and repay the account. The account may still 
be unresolved simply because it was listed in a 2014 credit report, but it may also have 
been resolved because it does not appear in two recent credit reports. It is unclear if the 
account has been resolved, despite Applicant’s best efforts to do so.  
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c.): These are two medical accounts with past-due balances 
of $218 and $230 that were placed for collection.27 Both accounts were paid in full on 
November 24, 2015.28 Both accounts have been resolved.

(SOR ¶¶ 1.d. and 1.e.): These are two medical accounts with past-due balances 
of $187 and $416 that were placed for collection.29 Both accounts were paid in full on 
November 24, 2015.30 Both accounts have been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): This is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $197 that was 
placed for collection and listed with Experian.31 Applicant was unable to identify the 
creditor. The account is not listed in Applicant’s November 2015 TransUnion credit 
report32 or his November 2015 Equifax credit report.33 Applicant was unable to obtain a 
copy of his Experian credit report.34 Applicant has made unsuccessful efforts to identify 
the creditor and repay the account. The account may still be unresolved simply because 
it was listed in a 2014 credit report, but it may also have been resolved because it does 
not appear in two recent credit reports. It is unclear if the account has been resolved, 
despite Applicant’s best efforts to do so.  
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): This is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $532 that was 
placed for collection.35 The account was paid in full on November 24, 2015.36 The 
account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.h.): This is an unspecified type of education account with an unpaid 
balance of $394 that was placed for collection.37 Applicant disputed the account 
because he had both student loans and the Montgomery G.I. Bill covering his 
educational expenses, and he could not understand why there would be any direct 
billing.38 Upon further investigation, it was determined that the debt was not Applicant’s. 
The state attorney general has filed a case against the creditor for bad debt-predatory 
practices, and the debt was eliminated several years ago.39 In November 2015, the 
creditor informed Applicant that the account had been closed on April 18, 2012,

because of the settlement with the state attorney general.40 The account has been 
resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.i.): This is an automobile loan from a bank with an unpaid balance of 
$14,707 that was placed for collection.41 Applicant had purchased a new vehicle for 
approximately $20,000 while he was in the U.S. Army, but after about eight months, he 
could no longer afford the payments. The vehicle was repossessed and sold at 
auction.42 Applicant contacted the creditor on several occasions and the discussions led 
first to a demand for $8,230, and then to a demand for $823. They agreed to a 
settlement.43 On October 30, 2015, he paid the contractor $823,44 and the creditor 
acknowledged that the account had been settled-in-full.45 The account was paid in full 
on November 24, 2015.46 The account has been resolved. 
As he matured, Applicant evolved into a more responsible individual. As a single 
father, he learned how to change diapers in the hospital. He has been uniquely active in 
his daughter’s upbringing, volunteered to lead her Girl Scout troop, and is active with 
fraternal organizations in community outreach. He now has health insurance. His bills 
are paid on time. He has a lifelong passion for his job.47 
Work Performance and Character References 
 The studio lead, who serves as a supervisor, is effusive in his praise for 
Applicant. He said that Applicant has demonstrated a dedication to the project by 
working long hours, not because he was asked to do so, but because he saw the need 
and took the initiative to get the job done. When Applicant’s interim clearance was 
revoked, Applicant continued to work hard on the project with a positive attitude, rather 
than looking for another job or becoming less productive. He considers Applicant to be 
“an invaluable member of our team.”48  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security

emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”49 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”50   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”51 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.52  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”53 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”54 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), a “history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. Applicant’s financial problems arose shortly after his discharge from 
the U.S. Army in 2007. At various points over the ensuing years, he was unable to 
continue making his routine monthly payments. Various accounts became delinquent 
and were placed for collection. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
                                                          
53

on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”55 Under AG ¶ 20(e), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where 
“the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt 
which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the 
basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) apply. AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies.  
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
but he apparently did spend beyond his means. To his credit, he acknowledged having 
made poor decisions in his early 20s and failing to understand the importance of his 
financial issues. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing financial 
difficulties make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so 
infrequent.” Instead, as noted above, Applicant’s financial problems started shortly after 
his medical discharge from the U.S. Army in June 2007. He went through brief periods 
of unemployment and one period of underemployment. He cared for his sick mother-in-
law and his pregnant wife. He was divorced in 2011, and while he was awarded custody 
of his daughter, he receives no child support from his ex-wife. Even though he was 
employed from 2009 until 2014, he did not have any health insurance benefits to help 
pay his medical expenses associated with his treatment for his panic disorder with 
agoraphobia. He was living paycheck-to-paycheck. Those circumstances were 
substantially beyond his control. Applicant was forced to prioritize his monthly payments 
because of an inability to make the normal payments. Now that the financial situation 
has improved and stabilized, it appears that Applicant’s unanticipated financial issues 
occurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur.  
To his credit, Applicant took control over his financial situation. He started taking 
classes with the Dave Ramsey Financial Peace University. He considered himself 
                                                          
55
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith “requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating 
condition].

financially naïve, and the classes taught him what he should have already known 
financially: about mortgages, checking accounts, credit scores, handling debts, 
collections, and budgeting. Applicant contacted, or attempted to contact, his known 
creditors to see if repayment arrangements could be made. He set up a proposed debt 
repayment plan, listing an anticipated debt repayment schedule. Luck interceded. He 
was reminded of the existence of an emergency fund that had previously been set up 
for him. Within a matter of days, those funds enabled him to pay several creditors in full. 
Applicant has successfully resolved six of the nine SOR accounts with payments, and 
one account with a successful dispute. It is unclear if the two remaining accounts (with 
relatively insignificant balances of $446 and $197) have been resolved because 
Applicant has been unable to identify the creditors, and neither account is listed in his 
most recent credit reports. Applicant has no other delinquent accounts. With a good 
salary, as well as health insurance benefits, there are clear indications that Applicant’s 
financial problems are under control. Applicant’s actions, under the circumstances 
confronting him, no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.56 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.57       
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant made a 
lot of poor decisions in his early 20s. He failed to understand the consequences of debt, 
failed to take his financial issues seriously, and did not fully appreciate the importance of

financial stability and debt management. Accounts were placed for collection, and an 
automobile was repossessed.  
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant has an outstanding reputation in the workplace. He is active in the community 
in which he has resided. While his initial potential resolution actions were constrained by 
his limited salary, Applicant commenced a course of conduct to address and resolve his 
financial problems. He sought financial counseling, contacted creditors, disputed an 
account when appropriate, and set up an intended debt repayment plan. With his new 
job and a substantially increased salary, as well as health insurance benefits, Applicant 
was about to start his intended repayment process. However, as noted above, good 
fortune intervened with the emergence of his emergency fund. Debt resolution followed 
without any further delay. Applicant has resolved nearly all of his debts with the possible 
exception of two relatively small debts. There are clear indications that Applicant’s 
financial problems are under control. His actions under the circumstances confronting 
him do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 58 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant  
  Subparagraph 1.f:    For Applicant

  Subparagraph 1.h:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.i:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
