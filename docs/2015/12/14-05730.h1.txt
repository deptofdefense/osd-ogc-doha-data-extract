DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant refuted the Guideline E (personal conduct) allegation, but failed to 
mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 15, 2015, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns under Guidelines F and E. DOD CAF took that action under Executive Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD CAF could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
 
2 
 
 
interest to continue Applicant’s security clearance. On March 30, 2015, Applicant 
answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On June 15, 2015, the case was assigned 
to me. On July 8, 2015, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Notice of Hearing scheduling the hearing for July 22, 2015. The hearing was held as 
scheduled.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, 
but later withdrew GE 2. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A 
through D. The record of the proceeding was left open to August 12, 2015, to provide 
Applicant the opportunity to present additional matters. He timely submitted documents 
that were marked as AE E through L. GE 1 and AE A through L were admitted into 
evidence without objection. The transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was received on July 29, 
2015. 
 
Preliminary Matters 
 
Applicant waived the 15-day hearing notice requirement under ¶ E.3.1.8 of the 
Directive.1 
 
Department Counsel requested that administrative notice be taken of 26 U.S.C § 
7203 and two Internal Revenue Service (IRS) documents that address income tax filing 
deadlines. Applicant had no objection to Department Counsel’s request. The request 
was granted.2 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his current employer since December 1991. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in 
1982. He served in the Navy from July 1978 to July 1988 and in the Navy Reserve from 
January 1989 to September 2004. He attained the grade of captain (O-6) and retired 
honorably. He married in 1983 and has three children, ages 23, 28, and 29. He has held 
a security clearance for over 30 years.3 
 
Under both Guidelines F and E, the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely 
file his federal income tax returns for 2006, 2008, and 2009 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 2.a); that 
he failed to pay $12,804 in federal taxes for 2009 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 2.a); that he failed to 
file his federal income tax returns for 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 and pay any taxes 
due for each year (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 2.a); that he failed to timely file his state income tax 
returns for 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 2.a); and that he failed to file

his state income tax returns for 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, and pay any taxes for 
each year (SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 2.a). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each 
allegation with comments. His admissions are incorporated as findings as fact.4  
 
In his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) dated April 
7, 2014, Applicant disclosed that he did not timely file his federal income tax returns for 
2006, 2008 and 2009. The information he provided about those tax returns is 
summarized in the following table:  
 
Federal Income Tax Returns 
Tax Year Month Tax Return Filed Reason for Late Filing Refund or Amount Due
2006 May 2009 Lost financial records. $3,563 refund. 
2008 October 2012 Misplaced financial 
records. 
$4,965 refund forfeited 
because of late filing. 
2009 January 2013 Misplaced financial 
records. 
$12,804 in taxes dues. 
Petitioned U.S. Tax 
Court and received 
favorable decision. 
 
In the e-QIP, he also disclosed that he filed his 2009 state income tax return late and 
owed about $400 in state income taxes that he paid in April 2014, the month in which he 
submitted the e-QIP. He further disclosed that he had not filed his federal and state 
income tax returns for 2010, 2011, and 2012. He indicated that he expected to file his 
2010 federal and state income tax returns on April 15, 2014 (approximately a week after 
submission of the e-QIP), and he was locating and assembling financial records for the 
other years.5  
 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant noted that his 2014 e-QIP was the first time 
that he was asked about the status of his tax filings and tax payments during a periodic 
reinvestigation of his security clearance. He indicated the previous investigations only 
asked about tax liens and the questions about tax filings and payments came as a “total 
surprise” to him. He stated that he started to get organized and locate financial records 
in early 2014 so that he could respond to the questions being asked about his taxes. He 
also indicated that he overstated his federal income tax deficiency for 2009. Instead of 
the $12,804 deficiency he reported for 2009, he actually owed $2,093 in taxes and 
$1,210 in interest and penalties for that year. He contested his federal tax deficiency for 
2009 in U.S. Tax Court. He stated he paid the deficiency in September 2013 upon 
receipt of the Tax Court’s decision, but provided no documentation confirming the 
payment of that tax deficiency.6

In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he did not disclose in his e-QIP 
the late filing of his 2006 through 2008 state income tax returns because he did not 
understand the question. He indicated that he expected to file his 2010 through 2013 
federal and state income tax returns in the near future. He stated he deeply regretted 
his tax filing deficiencies and highlighted a number of factors that showed he was 
reliable. He claimed that, during an IRS audit in 1999, the auditor informed him that he 
had three years from the filing deadline to actually file the tax return. He later learned 
that was erroneous information. He explained his tax deficiencies were the result of him 
having too many personal demands coupled with personal disorganization and 
misplaced priorities.7  
 
At the hearing, Applicant attributed his tax problems to being disorganized and 
placing his work ahead of other obligations. The tax documents that he had difficulty 
locating included paperwork for unreimbursed work-related travel expenses. He had 
unreimbursed travel expenses because he failed to file his travel claims in a timely 
manner. During his testimony, he also stated that he was audited by the IRS in the 
1990s because he had not filed his federal income tax return. He noted that he 
previously filed five to ten U.S. Tax Court appeals because the IRS had prepared 
substitute income tax returns for him in which they assessed him taxes. He would 
challenge such tax assessments by filing his actual Form 1040 for the year in question.8 
 
At the hearing, Applicant provided documentation confirming that he filed both his 
2010 and 2011 federal income tax returns on July 22, 2015 (the date of the hearing). He 
was entitled to refunds for both years, but forfeited those refunds because of his late tax 
filing. He also testified that he was issued a state tax assessment for 2010 before he 
submitted his state income tax return for that year. He did not contest the assessment 
and paid the assessed amount. He indicated that he was still in the process of preparing 
his federal income tax returns for 2012 and 2013 and his state income tax returns for 
2011 through 2013. He did not know whether he owed past-due state income taxes for 
the years in which he had not filed. He stated that he wished he could present additional 
tax filings, but noted it takes time to find and organize all the required records. He 
testified that he was committed to rectifying his tax filing deficiencies and anticipated 
completing the tax filing process within a short period of time. He further testified that he 
filed his 2014 federal and state income tax returns on time, but provided no documents 
confirming he filed those tax returns.9 
                                                          
7 Tr. 64-67; GE 1; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. The factors that Applicant highlighted to show 
he was reliability and trustworthy include the full disclosure of his tax issues in his e-QIP; his cooperation 
throughout the security clearance process; his efforts to improve his personal organization and record-
keeping; his reprioritizing of his obligations to ensure full compliance with tax filing and payment 
requirements; his long professional life characterized by unquestioned allegiance to the United States; his 
military and professional achievements; the lack of any other adverse matters concerning him; the poor 
advice he received during an IRS audit; and numerous other personal and family demands. See 
Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. He reiterated many of those factors in his post-hearing submission.

In his post-hearing submission, Applicant provided documents confirming that he 
filed his 2012 federal income tax return on August 5, 2015, and his 2013 federal income 
tax return on August 10, 2015. He expected to receive federal income tax refunds of 
$8,771 for 2012 and $14,940 for 2013. He also submitted documents confirming he paid 
the past-due amount of $1,036 for his 2010 state income taxes in February 2015. He 
indicated that all his federal income tax returns had been filed and he owed no 
additional money to the U.S. Treasury. He further indicated that his state income tax 
returns for 2011 through 2013 were being prepared, and he expected to file those 
returns in the near future. Additionally, he indicated that his state required a copy of the 
federal income tax return to be filed with the state income tax return for a particular year 
so completing the state returns was not possible until the federal returns were 
completed.10  
   
Applicant provided a letter from his supervisor that indicated Applicant is an 
expert in a very specialized scientific field. He has known Applicant for over ten years. 
He indicated he has not observed anything that would lead him to question Applicant’s 
judgment, reliability, or ability to properly safeguard national security information. He 
stated that Applicant has demonstrated a high attention to detail with regard to security 
matters.11  
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information Within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavourable, to reach his decision.  
                                                          
10 AE E, F, G, H, K, L.  
11 Tr. 67-68; AE D.

The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
 
7 
 
 
Applicant’s admissions and the record evidence established the following 
disqualifying condition under AG ¶ 19:   
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  
 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required . . . . 
 
 Four mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.  
 
 Applicant has a history of not complying with income tax return filing 
requirements. He failed to file his 2006 and 2008 through 2013 federal income tax 
returns in a timely manner. He filed his 2010 and 2011 federal income tax returns on the 
day of the hearing. He filed his 2012 and 2013 federal income tax returns after the 
hearing was held. Even though he provided no paperwork confirming payment of his 
2009 past-due federal taxes, he testified credibly he paid those taxes. In the past, he 
often relied on the IRS to prepare substitute income tax returns for him. If he disagreed 
with a tax assessment arising from a substitute return, he would then file his Form 1040 
to challenge that assessment.    
 
 Applicant failed to file his 2006 through 2013 state income tax returns in a timely 
manner. His state prepared a 2010 substitute income tax return for him and assessed 
him additional taxes. He paid that assessment. At the close of the record, he still had 
not filed his state income tax returns for 2011 through 2013. It is unknown whether he 
owes past-due state income taxes for those years. 
 
 Applicant failed to establish that a condition beyond his control caused his tax 
problems. The evidence established that Applicant has acted irresponsibly for many 
years by failing to file his federal and state income tax returns as required. He has been 
 
8 
 
 
on notice since submitting his e-QIP in April 2014 that his tax filing deficiencies raised 
security concerns, yet he still has not fully resolved those deficiencies. It appears this 
pending security clearance determination was the reason why he filed his 2010 through 
2013 federal tax returns recently. Insufficient evidence was presented to conclude that 
Applicant’s tax filing problems are unlikely to recur. His tax problems continue to cast 
doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the 
mitigating conditions fully apply. 
   
Guideline E, Personal Conduct  
 
The security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG ¶ 15, as follows: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
 AG ¶ 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: 
 
(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is 
not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single 
guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-
person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not 
properly safeguard protected information; and  
 
(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, 
that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such 
as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person’s personal, 
professional, or community standing . . . . 
 
 Applicant’s tax problems are adequately addressed under Guideline F. He 
disclosed his tax problems in his e-QIP. Insufficient evidence was presented to establish 
that Applicant is subject to exploitation because of his tax problems. Applicant refuted 
the Guideline E allegation. I find in favor of Applicant on Guideline E. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
9 
 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole-person concept. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under 
Guidelines F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 Applicant served in the military and honorably retired as a Navy captain. He is a 
valued employee. He has held a security clearance for many years. Nevertheless, 
despite being aware of his legal obligation to file his income tax returns in a timely 
manner, he acted irresponsibly by failing to comply with those requirements. This is a 
persistent problem that still is not resolved and continues to cast doubt on his eligibility 
and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant 
failed to mitigate the financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
      Subparagraph 1.a:     Against Applicant 
      Subparagraph 1.b:     For Applicant 
      Subparagraphs 1.c-1.e:     Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline E:   FOR APPLICANT 
      Subparagraph 2.a:     For Applicant 
 
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
