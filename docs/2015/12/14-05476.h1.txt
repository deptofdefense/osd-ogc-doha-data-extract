HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s credit reports and statement of reasons (SOR) showed one judgment 
and 13 collection accounts totaling $50,663. He filed his federal and state tax returns 
late for tax years 2010 to 2014. All of his SOR debts are resolved, except for one debt 
totaling about $4,700, and his $13,000 federal tax debt; both debts are in payment 
plans. Applicant retired from Navy service as a chief petty officer after serving 20 years 
of active service, including 11 years of sea duty. For 30 years he has made important 
contributions to national security and established a track record of integrity and honesty. 
Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. Access to classified 
information is granted.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On March 22, 2014, Applicant completed and signed an Electronic 
Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 
1) On December 10, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order 
(Exec. Or.) 10865,  Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated 
February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006. 
 
 
2 
                                         
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF could not make the affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative 
judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the 
financial considerations guideline. 
  
On February 24, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR, and on March 3, 2015, 
he requested a hearing. On June 27, 2015, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. 
On August 7, 2015, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
notice of hearing, setting the hearing for September 10, 2015. (HE 1) The hearing was 
held as scheduled. (Transcript (Tr.) 1)1 During the hearing, I approved Applicant’s 
request to recess the hearing because he was not prepared to fully address his financial 
issues. On September 22, 2015, DOHA issued a hearing notice continuing the hearing 
to October 22, 2015. (HE 2) The hearing was held as scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits, which were 
admitted into evidence without objection. (Tr1. 20-21; Tr2. 9; Government Exhibit (GE) 
1-3) Department Counsel offered statistics from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
showing Applicant’s adjusted gross income (AGI) (averaging about $220,000 from 2010 
to 2014) placed him in the top four percent of U.S. taxpayers. (Tr2. 165) Applicant 
objected due to lack of relevance. (Tr2. 166) The exhibit has limited relevance because 
it does not take into consideration the characteristics of the individual taxpayer. (Tr2. 
166-167) Applicant offered 45 exhibits, and 40 were admitted without objection. (Tr1. 1, 
20-21; Tr2. 52; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-SS) Department Counsel objected to AEs S, U, 
BB, NN, and OO because they are charts or tables Applicant prepared. (Tr2. 53-58, 
197-198) Applicant’s memorandum of law on admissibility of tables or charts is attached 
to the record as HE 6. (Tr2. 61) Admission was deferred pending Applicant’s statements 
about the content of the tables. (Tr2. 59-60) The tables Applicant generated had some 
errors. (Tr2. 97-99)  
 
At the time of the hearing, Applicant’s federal tax transcripts, which are 
generated by the IRS after receipt of Applicant’s income tax returns, were unavailable. 
Those transcripts were subsequently provided and admitted as an exhibit. (AE TT) The 
IRS transcripts were used to generate the table at page four, infra. Department Counsel 
objected based on hearsay and lack of relevance to admission of a Law Blog discussing 
legal problems of one of the collection agents seeking funds from Applicant. (Tr2. 101-
105; AE U) Department Counsel and Applicant’s objections go to the weight the exhibits 
receive. All objections to admissibility were overruled. (Tr2. 95-96, 105, 122, 166-168, 
198) After the hearing Applicant provided four additional exhibits, which were admitted 
without objection. (AE TT-WW) On September 18, 2015, the first transcript was 
received (Tr1). On November 3, 2015, the final exhibit was received, and the record 
was closed. (AE UU) On November 5, 2015, the second transcript was received. (Tr2)

Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.f and 1.k. 
He denied the remaining SOR allegations, and he also provided extenuating and 
mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor, who is seeking a 
security clearance. He provides advice on systems in development. (Tr2. 174)  In 1981, 
he graduated from high school. (Tr1. 5) He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from 
1986 to 2006. (Tr1. 7; AE EE) In 2007, he received a bachelor of science degree in 
information technology management. (Tr1. 6) He completed half of a master’s degree. 
(Tr1. 6) He completed 11 years and 2 months of sea service. (AE EE) Applicant was 
promoted to master chief petty officer (E-9) after 16 years of active Navy service. (Tr2. 
64; AE EE) In the Navy he operated and maintained systems. (Tr1. 6) In 1989, he 
married, and he has two sons, who are 20 and 21 years old and are in college. (Tr1. 42; 
GE 1) He has held a security clearance for more than 29 years. (Tr1. 7) There are no 
allegations of security violations. (Tr1. 16) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s finances were harmed when he attempted to keep the mortgage on 
his residence in state C in current status; his spouse was excessively spending; and he 
financially supported his brother’s family and his sister. (Tr2. 79-82) In 2002, Applicant 
purchased his residence in state C for $335,000; he made a down payment of $18,000; 
and he financed the remainder. (Tr1. 35-36; Tr2. 70-71, 181) The monthly payments 
were about $3,000. (Tr2. 70-71)  
 
In September 2006, Applicant put his home in state C on the market for $450,000 
in preparation for moving in December 2006, to state V after retirement from active 
Navy service. (Tr1. 16, 37) The housing bubble burst, and there was a dramatic, 
unprecedented drop in residential real estate values in state C. In a short time, 
Applicant lost $120,000 in market value of his home in state C, and the property was 
“underwater” as the market value was substantially less than his mortgage. (Tr1. 16-19, 
37, 46) In 2008, housing prices declined 39 percent in his county, and 8 percent of the 
housing units in his county were in foreclosure. (SOR response, enclosure 2) Applicant 
was unable to sell his home in state C. (Tr1. 17) From 2006 to 2010, Applicant had a 
monthly negative cash flow of from $1,500 to $3,000 on the house in state C, and he 
had a substantial tax deduction from owning a home in state C, while living in state V. 
(Tr1. 18; Tr2. 83, 153, 175) In 2009, he stopped making mortgage payments on his 
home in state C. (Tr1. 45; Tr2. 82-83) Starting in 2010, his federal income taxes 
increased by about $8,000 annually after the mortgage lender foreclosed on the 
property in state C. (Tr2. 71, 83, 175-177) Applicant did not receive any funds from the 
transfer of his residence in state C to the mortgage company. (Tr2. 71) The SOR does 
not allege that the foreclosure raised a security concern, and there is no evidence the 
mortgage lender is seeking payment from Applicant.

In 1996, Applicant’s spouse had postpartum depression. (Tr2. 72) She was later 
diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and then bipolar II with manic episodes. (Tr2. 
71) In 2003, she heard voices. (Tr2. 73) She continues to suffer from emotional and 
mental problems. (Tr2. 21, 28-29) She was delusional and paranoid. (Tr2. 39) She 
suspected Applicant’s mother and others of conspiring against her. (Tr2. 43, 73-74) She 
spent money excessively. (Tr2. 31-32, 40, 76) Her monthly expenditures on 
unnecessary items were about $1,600. (Tr2. 76-77) She shopped and spent heavily. 
(Tr2. 39) She purchased items the family never used. (Tr2. 40-41) Applicant is patient 
and supportive. (Tr2. 22) Eventually, Applicant separated his accounts from his 
spouse’s accounts. (Tr2. 77, 123-124) TRICARE covered most of her medical 
treatment. (Tr2. 75; AE AA)   
 
In 2009, Applicant’s brother, his brother’s wife, and his brother’s 10-year-old 
daughter lived with Applicant’s family for one year because Applicant’s brother was 
unemployed. (Tr2. 36-37) Applicant was very generous and provided food and support 
for his brother’s family when they lived together and later after his brother’s family 
moved out on their own. (Tr2. 38, 44) Applicant also provided financial support to his 
sister. (Tr2. 45) Applicant is honest and “a man of true faith and integrity.” (Tr2. 45) 
 
Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, SF 86, 
SOR response, and hearing record. Applicant’s SOR alleges and the record establishes 
the following financial information: 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b allege Applicant failed to file state tax returns for tax years 
2010 through 2013, and federal tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2012. Applicant 
explained why he did not timely file his tax returns as follows, “That period of time was 
very overwhelming. I was dealing with a lot of work, a lot of issues with my wife, a lot of 
financial stress, and I was - - I just failed to meet my responsibility as far as that’s 
concerned.” (Tr2. 155) He drafted his tax returns and could have filed them timely; 
however, he believed he would have to send funds for the taxes owed with the returns, 
and he did not have the funds to do so. (Tr2. 178, 180-181) He described 2010 to 2013 
as “the worst three-year period of my life. And I will stipulate that I did a poor job.” (Tr2. 
178) He did not obtain legal advice about filing his tax returns, and he was not aware 
that it was a misdemeanor not to file his tax returns. (Tr2. 179) 
 
By the time his hearing occurred, Applicant had filed his federal and state tax 
returns, and he paid all of his state taxes and most of his federal income taxes. (Tr2. 89-
91, 96-97, 123, 153; AE D; AE E; AE P; AE DD; AE PP; AE SS; AE TT) His state tax 
returns were filed at the same time as his federal income tax returns. (Tr2. 90; AE SS; 
AE TT) His records establish the following federal income tax information (amounts are 
rounded to nearest thousand dollars for privacy reasons) (AE TT):

Applicant has an established payment plan where the IRS has agreed to accept 
payment of $400 monthly from Applicant. (Tr2. 92; AE Q) For tax years 2010 to 2014 
Applicant paid the IRS $195,000, and has a federal tax debt for $13,000. (Tr2. 92; AE 
TT) This is approximately the total of interest and penalties remaining from under 
withholding of his monthly payments and late filing of his federal income tax returns for 
2010 to 2014. (AE TT) He plans to pay the remainder of his IRS debt in 12 months. 
(Tr2. 93) 
 
The credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.c for $6,378 is for a judgment filed in October 
2010—Paid. (AE VV) Applicant contacted the creditor, and the creditor said no payment 
was due. (AE VV; AE WW at 3-4) In October 2015, the creditor provided a printout 
showing Applicant made payments from 2008 to 2013. (AE VV at 4-5) On November 2, 
2015, the creditor, who obtained the judgment, filed a satisfaction of judgment with the 
court. (Tr2. 99-100, 126-131; GE 3 at 22; AE CC at 6; AE VV at 12-13)   
 
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a collection account for $210—Paid. On August 14, 2015, 
Applicant paid $314 resolving this debt. (Tr2. 100; AE F) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a collection credit card account for $14,135—Paid. In 2010, 
Applicant entered into a payment agreement with the collection agent. (AE G; GE 2 at 
4) Applicant had two accounts with the same creditor; he said he paid the debt; and he 
disputed the continued entry of this collection account on his credit report. (Tr1. 26-27; 
Tr2. 100-106, 132-141; GE 3 at 13; AE G; AE U) Applicant’s April 5, 2014 combined 
credit report shows that an account owed to this creditor was “legally paid in full for less 
than full amount”; the account is closed; and the balance is zero. (Tr2. 86, 106-107; GE 
2 at 4) The entry for the collection credit card account does not appear on Applicant’s 
2015 credit reports as having a delinquent balance. (Tr2. 135-136; AE T; AE CC; AE 
WW)    
 
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a collection account for $4,931—Paid. On August 13, 2015, he 
paid the creditor $2,000, resolving the debt. (Tr2. 107-108; AE H; AE V; AE QQ)  
                                            
2Department Counsel provided information from the IRS showing Applicant’s AGI was in the top 
four percent of U.S. taxpayers. (GE 4) 
 
3In September 2014, Applicant paid the IRS $7,500. (Tr1. 51; Tr2. 93, 171-172; AE R; AE TT) In 
September 2015, Applicant paid the IRS $26,680. (Tr1. 51-52) The funds paid in September 2015 were 
from Applicant’s savings and his retirement account. (Tr1. 52)

SOR ¶¶ 1.g to 1.i allege three government collection accounts for $250, $2,029, 
and $1,245—Paid. The three debts resulted from the Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA) making payments for college credits, and then Applicant failed to complete the 
courses. On September 14, 2015, and October 1, 2015, he made payments resolving 
the three debts to the VA. (Tr1. 28-30; Tr2. 87, 109-112, 141-146; GE 2 at 10; GE 3 at 
2, 14-15; AE T at 12; AE O; AE CC at 14; AE W; AE WW at 9-10)   
 
SOR ¶ 1.j alleges a collection account for $312—Paid. On August 13, 2015, 
Applicant paid $12 bringing his account to a zero balance and resolving the debt. (Tr2. 
112-114, 146-148; AE X) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.k alleges a collection account for $68—Paid. On August 14, 2015, 
Applicant paid the creditor $69 resolving the debt. (Tr1. 30; Tr2. 114; GE 3 at 9; AE I) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.l alleges a telecommunications collection account for $544—Paid. On 
August 17, 2015, Applicant paid the creditor $218 and settled the debt. (Tr1. 30-31; Tr2. 
115; GE 2 at 15; GE 3 at 5; AE J)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.m alleges a bank collection account for $4,446—Payment Plan. On 
September 9, 2015, he paid the creditor $697. (AE K; AE Z) On October 15, 2015, he 
paid the creditor $400. (AE Z) Applicant has an October 23, 2015 payment plan to 
resolve this debt by paying $4,697 no later than August 31, 2016. (Tr2. 31-32; Tr2. 115-
119, 150-151; AE UU) He assures he will comply with the payment plan. (Tr. 115-119) 
  
SOR ¶ 1.n alleges a collection account for $1,330—Paid. Applicant said this debt 
resulted from attendance at a university. The university debt is paid. (Tr2. 108-109; GE 
3 at 32; AE H; AE V; AE CC at 14; AE QQ; AE WW at 25) Applicant said this debt is a 
part of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f. (Tr2. 119) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.o alleges a collection-credit account for $14,411, which resulted from a 
vehicle debt—Paid. His credit report indicates in June 2013, the debt was “paid in full 
for less than full balance.” (Tr2. 87-88, 119-120, 148-150, 189-190; GE 2 at 15; AE CC 
at 8; AE WW at 5, 17-18)     
 
SOR ¶ 1.p alleges a collection account for $374—Paid. On August 17, 2015, the 
Applicant paid the creditor $374. (Tr2. 120-121; AE L)  
 
Applicant chose to send his sons to expensive private high schools, which cost 
$16,000 dollars each year. (Tr2. 156-157) College tuition for both sons totals $48,000 
annually. (Tr2. 161) He and his family also went on some vacations, using money that 
could have been spent to pay his creditors. 
 
Applicant does not use credit cards. (Tr2. 79) His only debts are his federal 
income tax debt, his $4,700 debt in SOR ¶ 1.m, and a $420 monthly car loan debt. (Tr1. 
33; Tr2. 123) He uses debit cards for purchases. (Tr2. 79) Applicant paid numerous 
debts as agreed in loan agreements over the years. (Tr2. 84-85, 88; GE 3; AE NN) He 
 
7 
                                         
 
has a net financial remainder each month of $3,000. (Tr2. 121) He promised to timely 
file and pay his state and federal income taxes. (Tr2. 124) In 2010 or 2011, he received 
financial counseling. (Tr2. 186, 195-197) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
 A friend and colleague, who has been working with Applicant since 2008 and 
held a security clearance since 1987, described Applicant as a respected professional. 
(Tr2. 15-17, 30) Applicant volunteers for his church. (Tr2. 17-18) He takes responsibility 
for his conduct, and he is candid, forthright, and honest. (Tr2. 21, 23) His integrity is 
beyond reproach. (Tr2. 23-26) His innovation, leadership, and energy enable him to 
make great contributions to mission accomplishment. (Tr2. 27, 34) He recommended 
reinstatement of Applicant’s security clearance. (Tr2. 26) 
   
Applicant provided seven character statements from friends, colleagues, 
supervisors, and his pastor. (AE HH-AE MM; AE RR) The authors of the statements 
have known Applicant from a few years to decades, and include statements from high-
level Navy officials and senior officers who have held security clearances for many 
years. The statements laud Applicant’s duty performance, leadership, trustworthiness, 
integrity, and important contributions to the national defense. The seven statements 
support continuation of his security clearance. 
      
 Applicant’s awards are listed in his DD Form 214 and are as follows: one Armed 
Forces Expeditionary Medal (AFEM); four Sea Service Deployment Ribbons (SSDR); 
six Good Conduct Medals (GCM); two National Defense Service Medals (NDSM); five 
Battle “E” Ribbons (BER); one Southeast Asia Service Medal (SASM); three Navy and 
Marine Corps Achievement Medals (NMCAM); and one Navy Commendation Medal 
(NCM). (AE EE; AE FF) He also received numerous other lesser awards, such as, 
Sailor of Year, and he completed several training courses. (Tr2. 63; AE FF) Applicant 
provided several superlative enlisted performance evaluation reports, establishing his 
outstanding duty performance over many years. (Tr2. 63; AE GG)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
 
8 
                                         
 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this 
decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
 
9 
                                         
 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts;” “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;” and “(g) failure to file annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the  
same.” Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, SF 86, 
SOR response, and hearing record. Applicant’s SOR alleges, and the evidence 
establishes Applicant had one judgment and 13 collection accounts totaling $50,663. He 
also failed to timely file his state and federal tax returns for tax years 2010 to 2014. 
Failure to file tax returns may be a federal criminal offense as such conduct can violate 
26 U.S.C. § 7203.4 The judgment for $6,378 in SOR ¶ 1.c was satisfied in 2013; the 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.e for $14,135 was resolved before the SOR was issued, and the debt 
in SOR ¶ 1.o for $14,411 was also resolved in 2013, leaving about $16,000 in debt to 
be explained or resolved. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in 
AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability 
of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
                                            
4 26 U.S.C. § 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, provides:  
 
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this 
title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or 
supply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such 
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by 
law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a 
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 
($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, 
together with the costs of prosecution. 
 
 
10 
                                         
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;5 and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a) through 20(d) apply, and 20(e) applies to the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e for 
$14,135. When Applicant left active duty, he needed to move from state C to state V for 
employment reasons. The housing bubble burst, and the fair market value of his 
property became substantially less than his mortgage. His negative cash flow averaged 
about $25,000 per year. Applicant’s spouse suffered from bipolar disease, and she 
spent money on unnecessary items. Applicant’s brother and his family moved in with 
Applicant when his brother became unemployed. These are all circumstances beyond 
his control which adversely affected his finances. He received financial counseling. All 
of his SOR debts are resolved, except for one debt totaling about $4,700, which is in a 
payment plan, and a federal income tax debt of about $13,000, which is in an 
                                            
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

established payment plan. Applicant made some payments to address the debt in SOR 
¶ 1.e; the debt was transferred several times; Applicant disputed the debt, and it was 
removed from his credit report.    
 
Applicant’s AGI was in the top four percent of U.S. taxpayers. This statistic does 
not take into account situations such as a large negative cash flow from a property or a 
spouse’s mental and emotional problems. Applicant chose to send his sons to 
expensive private high schools instead of using his income to timely pay his income 
taxes, and the family took expensive vacations. He admitted he made some poor 
financial decisions. Applicant made excellent progress bringing his debts to current 
status.  
 
Applicant’s failure to timely file his tax returns and pay his taxes raises the most 
significant security concern. For tax years 2010 to 2014, Applicant paid the IRS 
$195,000, and has a federal debt for interest and penalties of $13,000. He filed his tax 
returns, and he has a payment plan to resolve his $13,000 federal tax debt. He 
expressed sincere remorse and assured he will timely file and pay his federal and state 
taxes in the future. Based on his credible and sincere promise to timely file his tax 
returns and to pay his taxes, such conduct “is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on [Applicant’s] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” and “there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” His filing and 
payment of his taxes and other debts showed good faith. His efforts are sufficient to fully 
mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Even if Applicant provided 
insufficient information to mitigate security concerns under AG ¶ 20, he mitigated 
security concerns under the whole-person concept, infra. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
12 
                                         
 
Applicant is a 51-year-old retired Navy chief petty officer. He served 11 years of 
sea duty and was awarded numerous medals, ribbons, and certificates during his active 
service. He has been employed by the same government contractor since 2007. He 
received a bachelor of science degree, and he completed half of a master’s degree. 
Seven character statements and two witnesses laud Applicant’s dedication to his family 
and church, duty performance, leadership, trustworthiness, integrity, and important 
contributions to the national defense. There is no evidence of any security or 
employment rule violations, alcohol abuse, use of illegal drugs, or criminal conduct. 
 
Applicant’s credit reports and SOR showed one judgment and 13 collection 
accounts totaling $50,663. The judgment and his two largest debts were resolved 
before the SOR was issued, leaving him with about $16,000 in unresolved debt. He also 
failed to timely file his state and federal tax returns for tax years 2010 to 2014. He filed 
his tax returns before his hearing, and he has a payment plan to resolve his $13,000 
federal tax debt.6 When an issue of delinquent taxes is involved, an administrative judge 
is required to consider how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin 
making payments and whether payments begin before or after a tax lien or levy is filed.7 
There were no tax liens or levies filed against Applicant. All of his SOR debts are 
resolved, except for one debt totaling about $4,700, which is in a payment plan. 
 
 Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances by aggressively working to 
resolve his debts. His three 2015 credit reports indicate he has numerous paid and 
resolved accounts. He understands that he needs to pay his debts, and the conduct 
required to retain his security clearance. The Appeal Board has addressed a key 
element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating:  
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence 
of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant 
is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
                                            
6See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security 
clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A security clearance represents 
an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor 
other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and 
ability to protect classified information.”). 
 
7See ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security 
clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant’s control 
adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant’s wages, 
and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and insufficient 
discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens).

and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted). Applicant has established a “meaningful track record” of debt 
re-payment, and I am confident he will maintain his financial responsibility.8 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the 
Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole 
person. Financial considerations concerns are mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.p:  For Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national security to grant or reinstate Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

8The Government has the option of following-up with more questions about Applicant’s finances. 
The Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit reports, 
investigation, and interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the Government from 
subsequently revoking it, if warranted. “The Government has the right to reconsider the security 
significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct having negative security 
significance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012). Violation of a promise made in a 
security context to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may 
support future revocation of a security clearance. An administrative judge does not have “authority to 
grant an interim, conditional, or probationary clearance.” ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 
2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28, 2011)). See also ISCR Case No. 04-03907 
at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006) (stating, “The Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or 
probationary security clearance to allow her the opportunity to have a security clearance while she works 
on her financial problems.”). This footnote does not imply that this decision to grant Applicant’s security 
clearance is conditional.
