GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 15, 2014, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On February 7, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the DOD on September

1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and 
detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators could not make an affirmative finding under 
the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative 
judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 19, 2015. In a sworn 
statement, dated March 9, 2015, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On May 8, 2015, Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to 
me on July 9, 2015. A Notice of Hearing was issued on July 31, 2015. I convened the 
hearing, as scheduled, on August 25, 2015. 
 
 During the hearing, four Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4) and one 
administrative exhibit were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. 
The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on September 2, 2015. I kept the record 
open to enable Applicant to supplement it. He timely submitted a number of documents 
which were marked and accepted as Applicant Exhibits (AE A through AE I), without 
objection. The record closed on September 23, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations in the 
SOR under financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.n.). Applicant’s admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as an electronic technician since April 2006.2 He previously served in another 
position with another company on the same contract beginning in November 2003.3 A 
1992 high school graduate,4 Applicant attended a community college for about a year, 
and subsequently received technology training at a local technical school on a part-time 
basis, for which he was awarded certificates of completion, but he did not earn a 
degree.5 Applicant has never served with the United States military.6 He was granted a

Financial Considerations 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until after he was married 
in October 2006. He attributed his financial woes to a number of causes. He and his 
wife were financially irresponsible and they purchased items and took out too much 
credit. They did not keep a budget. They purchased a residence in September 2007, to 
be closer to a particular religious school for her son, and, with the expectation that his 
wife would operate a day-care business from their residence, they spent a significant, 
but unspecified, amount for home improvements. It is unclear what happened to the 
day-care plan, although Applicant indicated that it was fairly successful, and it enabled 
them to meet payments on some accounts during that particular period. But, there were 
simply too many bills. She continued to spend freely, and Applicant stood by and 
permitted her to do so. When he earned more money, they spent that much more. As a 
result, their bills increased to a point where Applicant was unable to continue making all 
of his normal monthly payments. His wife’s next venture was to attend truck driving 
school in an effort to generate additional funds. Unfortunately, she was fired during her 
training, and she was subsequently unable to find employment in that field because of 
her inexperience. She took a job as a nursing assistant for the elderly, but was unable 
to handle that job. She then developed unspecified medical problems which “have kept 
her from working.” In 2013, they moved to another residence in a different state. 
Applicant’s wife and her sister owned and operated a restaurant from November 2014 
until recently, when her sister pulled out of the partnership and Applicant started 
supporting it. He pays $800 a month, plus utilities, to operate the restaurant, but it is 
currently closed for repairs. The venture has not yet paid off, and is actually costing him 
money.10 
Applicant did not file his state or federal income tax returns for the tax years 
2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, as required by law.11 He was aware

 The legal requirement to file a federal income tax return is based upon certain conditions, including an 
individual’s gross income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that there is an obligation to so file, 
the following applies: 
 
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title or by 
regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any 
information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such 
records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in 
addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction 
thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned 
not more than 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. In the case of any person with 
 
4 
                                      
 
that he was required to file his federal income tax returns. He explained that when he 
was preparing his federal income tax return for tax year 2007, he was experiencing 
problems while using the TurboTax system, and he was unable to obtain certain 
information from the prior year. As a result, the effort ceased. During the ensuing years, 
because of his failure to file the earlier tax returns, he was unsure as to how to file the 
newer ones. He did not request assistance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 
Applicant denied that he ignored the process each year. Instead, he attributed the 
delays to “everything that was going on and my financial mess that I had at the time, it 
really kind of got put off.” He added, “with everything on me, with all of this stuff, it just -- 
it was one more thing I knew I had to do and it just kept getting pushed aside.” In other 
words, he was overwhelmed by his circumstances. On May 1, 2014, because of his 
security clearance, Applicant sought assistance from a tax preparation firm, and his 
federal income tax returns for the past-due tax years were finally prepared and filed.12 
He did not file state income tax returns because he was unsure that he had to.13 
In addition to the untimely federal income tax returns, the SOR identified 13 
purportedly continuing delinquent accounts, totaling approximately $28,218, which had 
been placed for collection or charged off. Those debts and their respective current 
status, according to a May 2014 credit report14 and a February 2015 credit report,15 
Applicant’s comments to the investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM), his Answer to the SOR, and his testimony, are described below. 
Among the accounts that remain unpaid or otherwise unresolved, are: SOR ¶¶ 
1.a. and 1.b. – two medical (weight loss) accounts with past-due balances of $171 and 
$122 that were placed for collection when the insurance did not cover the charges and 
Applicant disputed the diagnoses;16 SOR ¶ 1.c. – a cable television account with a past-
due balance of $849 that was placed for collection when Applicant terminated his 
service and failed to return associated equipment, and although the creditor furnished 
him some supplies to do so, he has not yet done anything;17 SOR ¶ 1.d. – an 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
respect to whom there is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such 
person with respect to such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with 
respect to such failure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the first 
sentence of this section shall be applied by substituting "felony" for "misdemeanor" and "5 years" 
for "1 year".

unspecified bank loan account with a past-due balance of $3,066 (erroneously alleged 
as $3,773) that was placed for collection;18 SOR ¶ 1.g. – an unspecified bank loan 
account with a past-due balance of $2,142 that was placed for collection;19 SOR ¶ 1.h. – 
a home mortgage on Applicant’s former principal residence, but now a rental property, 
with over a 120 days past-due balance of $3,773 (and a remaining balance of $91,130) 
that was placed for collection;20 SOR ¶ 1.i. – a combined Internet and cable television

was placed for collection;24 and SOR ¶ 1.m. – an unspecified type of account with an 
unpaid balance of $5,833 that was placed for collection and charged off.25 
Among the accounts that Applicant contends he or his wife took some action to 
make payments or otherwise resolve, but for which he has failed to submit any 
documentation to support his contentions, are: SOR ¶ 1.e. – an unspecified bank loan 
account with a past-due balance of $7,576 (subsequently increased to $7,976) that was 
placed for collection, and according to Applicant, he made some payments and 
eventually missed a payment, failed to comply with a mediation agreement, and the 
account remains unpaid;26 and SOR ¶ 1.f. – a fitness center account with an unpaid 
balance of $842 that was placed for collection, and according to Applicant, his wife said 
she paid the bill, and the account is no longer listed in his February 2015 credit report.27  
During his interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant discussed and 
acknowledged a number of delinquent accounts. There were also accounts for which he 
had no information. He did not dispute the information related to those accounts listed in 
his credit report. He indicated that he would pay some bills in full, contact some of the

creditors to work out payments, or return equipment.28 There is no evidence that he has 
followed through with his stated intentions.  
 Applicant has a number of other delinquent accounts that were not alleged in the 
SOR. They include credit card accounts (including one that had been charged-off) and a 
mortgage on a mobile home that is “getting close to foreclosure.” He has already 
received some unspecified documentation from the court regarding the foreclosure 
issue, and he does not have the funds to hire an attorney to represent him.29 He made a 
$172.10 payment in January 2015 on one formerly delinquent credit card account, 
which is now closed by the credit grantor;30 and a $255.45 payment in June 2015 on 
another formerly delinquent credit card account, which is also now closed by the credit 
grantor.31 Although he previously referred to other non-SOR delinquent accounts, and 
indicated he was either working with creditors or making payments, he submitted no 
documentation to support his narrative. Applicant anticipated an income tax refund of 
approximately $10,000 this year and planned on using it to address some of his 
delinquent accounts.32 While his filing date was April 15, 2015, approximately five 
months before the record closed, during that period he failed to submit any 
documentation to support the existence of a refund, the amount of the refund, or any 
payments to creditors.  
 
 During the hearing, Applicant estimated that he had approximately $80 in his 
checking account, $5 in his savings account, and $21,000 to 22,000 in his 401(k) 
retirement account.33  He owns three vehicles and an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) that have 
already been paid off.34 On the last day of the month, after receiving family income and 
paying family expenses, Applicant does not expect to have any money remaining for 
discretionary spending or saving.35 Because of the uncertainty of his security clearance 
and job status, Applicant and his wife have focused on making the restaurant a 
successful venture.36 He has not sought the assistance of a financial counselor.37 Other 
than hoping to avoid having to file for bankruptcy,38 Applicant has no specific plan 
regarding the handling of his delinquent debts other than hoping to retain his job,

receive his income tax refund, and make the restaurant successful, all to generate the 
funds to enable him to pay off his creditors.39 There is no evidence that Applicant’s 
financial problems are either under control or that they have been resolved. 
 
Character References and Work Performance 
 
 Applicant’s supervisor has known him since 2006. He considers Applicant to be a 
reliable worker and an asset in maintaining a positive security environment.40 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”41 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”42   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”43 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
 
8 
                                      
 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.44  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”45 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”46 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying. 
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. In addition, security concerns may be raised under AG ¶ 19(g), for a 
“failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required. . .” 
Applicant has been experiencing significant financial problems since 2006, when the 
first of his various accounts commenced the slide into delinquency. Starting in 2008, 
and continuing for several years thereafter, he failed to timely file his federal income tax 
returns for 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and  
19(g) have been established. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial considerations. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying 
condition may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does 
not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” 
Also, under AG ¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” Evidence that “the person has received or is receiving 
counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control” is potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Also, AG & 20(d) 
applies where the evidence shows “the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.”47 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply. The nature, frequency, and 
recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties since late 2006 make it difficult to 
conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” Applicant attributed his 
financial problems to a variety of causes and misadventures such as: financial 
                                                          
47
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

irresponsibility with his wife spending freely and Applicant simply standing by; using too 
much credit; not keeping a budget; purchasing a residence nearer to a certain school; 
spending too much on the residence to operate a day-care business from the residence; 
and other commercial interests of his wife which simply failed to pan out. None of the 
expressed reasons appear to be beyond Applicant’s control.  
 
There is a paucity of evidence to indicate that Applicant took any steps to contact 
his creditors (even for one account for only $122) in an effort to resolve his debts. All but 
two of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR remain essentially ignored by him. 
As to the two remaining delinquent accounts, Applicant has offered excuses and 
explanations, but he offered no documentation to support his contentions that he or his 
wife made some good-faith efforts to resolve them with some recent payments. 
Furthermore, he has no actual plan for addressing his delinquent accounts. Instead, he 
is hoping to retain his job, hoping to receive his income tax refund, and hoping to make 
the restaurant successful, all to generate the funds to enable him to pay off his 
creditors. “Hope” is not a strategy for addressing financial problems. Furthermore, 
because he has never received financial counseling, it appears that Applicant is 
perplexed as to how to proceed. 
 
 Applicant had approximately $80 in his checking account, $5 in his savings 
account, and $21,000 to $22,000 in his 401(k) retirement account. He owns four 
vehicles, including an ATV. On the last day of the month, after receiving family income 
and paying family expenses, Applicant does not expect to have any money remaining 
for discretionary spending or saving. Rather than addressing his financial problems and 
focusing on his security clearance and his job, because of the uncertainty of his security 
clearance and job status, Applicant and his wife have focused on making the restaurant 
a successful venture. Applicant’s security clearance and compliance with his financial 
obligations were not high enough on his priority scale. The overwhelming evidence is 
that Applicant’s financial problems are not under control. Applicant has not acted 
responsibly by generally failing to address his delinquent accounts.48  
 
Applicant’s failures to timely file his federal income tax returns were neither 
infrequent nor under unusual circumstances; they constituted a routine practice that 
continued to occur over a multiyear period. It is his failure to see the urgency or to be 
motivated to do so, that sets Applicant’s actions apart. The law is to be complied with, 
and it is not up to the individual to determine the urgency, or generate the motivation, to 
comply with the law in a timely manner. In the absence of clear demonstrations that his 
behavior has been modified, there is nothing to indicate that it is unlikely to recur. 
Applicant’s actions under the circumstances presented continue to cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.49

 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s behavior. He has been 
working on the same contract since 2003 and with the same employer since 2006. His 
supervisor thinks highly of him. He is apparently a loving and caring husband and 
stepfather. He has made some small periodic payments on accounts that were not 
alleged in the SOR. He has declared his intentions of avoiding bankruptcy and 
eventually bringing his accounts current and repaying them. There is no evidence of 
substance abuse or security violations. While he failed to timely file his federal income 
tax returns for a multi-year period, he finally did so in 2014, before the SOR was issued.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial 
than the mitigating evidence. Applicant’s indebtedness was caused by frivolous and 
irresponsible spending. He has a lengthy history of not meeting financial obligations. 
Applicant routinely failed to timely file his federal income tax returns over a multi-year 
period. He has continued to ignore most of his delinquent accounts; and he has no 
monthly remainder available for spending or saving. 
 
Applicant is focused on his wife’s restaurant, not his security clearance. He has 
no budget. He has no repayment plan. He simply has “hope.” Applicant’s long-standing 
failure or inability to voluntarily repay his creditors, even in the smallest amounts, or to 
arrange payment plans, reflects traits which raise concerns about his fitness to hold a 
security clearance. There are clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are 
not under control. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances cast doubt on his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Considering the absence of confirmed 
debt resolution and elimination efforts, Applicant’s financial issues are likely to remain.

The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:50 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “meaningful track record” necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated an essentially negative track record of voluntary 
debt reduction and elimination efforts, generally ignoring his delinquent debts, but 
promising to eventually take some corrective actions. He did finally file his federal 
income tax returns. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and 
doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these 
reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from 
his financial considerations concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.m.: Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.n.:    For Applicant

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
