DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 27, 2015, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F. DOD CAF took that action under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD CAF could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to continue Applicant’s security clearance. On March 23, 2015, Applicant 
 
2 
 
 
answered the SOR and requested a hearing. In an undated letter, she later 
supplemented her Answer to the SOR. On June 30, 2015, I was assigned this case. On 
July 8, 2015, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of 
Hearing scheduling the hearing for July 23, 2015. The hearing was held as scheduled.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 
4, while Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E. The record 
of the proceeding was left open to August 6, 2015, to provide Applicant the opportunity 
to present additional matters. She submitted documents that were marked as AE F 
through J. All exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. The transcript (Tr.) 
of the hearing was received on July 31, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been 
working for her current employer since November 2002. She graduated from high 
school in 1980 and earned an associate’s degree in 2002. She served in the U.S. Air 
Force (USAF) for 22 years and retired as a technical sergeant (E-6) in 2002. She has 
been married twice. She married her current husband in February 2011 and has one 
adult child. She first obtained her security clearance while serving in the USAF.1 
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file her federal and state income tax 
returns for 2005, 2006, 2009, and 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and that she had four delinquent 
debts totaling $2,377 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b–1.e). In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted 
two allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c) and denied the remaining allegations. Her 
admissions are incorporated as findings as fact.2 
 
In her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) dated 
March 19, 2012, Applicant disclosed that she failed to file her federal income tax returns 
for 2005, 2006, 2009, and 2010, but also indicated in the comments section that she 
thought she had filed her 2005 and 2006 federal income tax returns. She stated that she 
was working with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to resolve her back taxes. In an 
interview with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator on May 16, 2012, 
Applicant also indicated that she had failed to file her state income tax returns for those 
same years. She stated she did not file her income tax returns because she could not 
afford to pay the taxes that were due.3

2 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR; GE 1-4. In the SOR, there was a typographical error. The year 
2006 in SOR ¶ 1.a was listed as “200.”  Applicant had no objection to correcting the SOR so that year 
was reflected as “2006.”

In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant provided copies of her federal and state 
income tax returns for 2005, 2006, 2009, and 2010. Those copies were apparently 
obtained from her tax preparer’s office and were neither signed nor dated. The tax 
preparer’s invoice for 2005 was dated May 18, 2012; the invoice for 2009 was dated 
May 17, 2010; and the IRS e-file Signature Authorization for 2010 was dated April 13, 
2011. For 2005, she owed $3,374 to the IRS and was entitled to a state tax refund of 
$438. For 2006, she owed $3,741 to the IRS and was entitled to a state tax refund of 
$432. For 2009, she owed $5,330 to the IRS and was entitled to a state tax refund of 
$414. For 2010, she owed $4,183 to the IRS and was entitled to a state tax refund of 
$277.4 
 
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant provided a receipt showing that she paid 
$1,507 in March 2015 to satisfy the $675 judgment filed against her in 2005 (SOR ¶1.b). 
She also provided receipts showing the $1,490 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.c was 
paid in May 2012; the $134 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.d was paid in March 2015; 
and the $78 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.e was paid in May 2012.5 
 
At the hearing, Applicant stated that her step-father passed away in 2004. At that 
time, she was a single parent. As the eldest daughter, she felt obligated to support her 
mother who was a victim of a large hurricane. By providing support to her mother, 
Applicant was not able to meet her own financial obligations. She stated that she did not 
initially file her income tax returns because she knew she owed taxes that she could not 
afford to pay. She indicated that she finally realized her approach was flawed and filed 
her returns.6 
 
Applicant testified that she has filed all of her federal and state income tax 
returns for 2005 through 2014. She owed the IRS about $35,000 in past-due taxes for 
2007 through 2014, which was not alleged in the SOR. She stated that she entered into 
a repayment plan with the IRS in about 2012 and paid about $4,000 or $5,000 toward 
her past-due taxes last year. She indicated that changes are periodically made to the 
repayment plan. She expected that her monthly IRS payment would soon increase to 
$625. Those payments are generally withdrawn from her bank account automatically; 
however, she periodically has to renew the withdrawal authorization. In her post-hearing 
submission, she provided IRS documentation confirming the existence of the repayment 
plan. She also testified that she was making adjustments to her withholding to avoid 
further tax delinquencies. She noted that she was current with her payments on about 
$16,000 in student loans and had received some financial counseling from her tax 
preparer.7

Applicant’s annual salary is about $48,000. She receives about $18,000 annually 
from her military retirement. Her husband also is retired from the military. She estimated 
that their combined annual income was about $120,000 and their monthly discretionary 
income was about $1,500.8 
 
For her military service, Applicant was awarded four Air Force Commendation 
Medals, an Air Force Achievement Medal, and six Air Force Good Conduct Medals. In 
2001, she was recognized as her command’s outstanding noncommissioned officer of 
the year. She served on active duty in Saudi Arabia and South Korea.9 
 
Applicant’s civilian work performance evaluations reflect that she consistently 
exceeds expectations. She has received a number of annual merit pay increases, 
bonuses, and awards. She has been nominated to receive the 2015 Star Award for her 
outstanding work performance. She provided letters of reference from coworkers and 
friends that attest to her professionalism, honesty, integrity, dependability, 
trustworthiness, and exceptional work ethic.10 
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information Within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavourable, to reach his decision.

The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
 
6 
 
 
Applicant’s admissions and the record evidence established the following 
disqualifying condition under AG ¶ 19:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  
 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required . . . . 
 
 Four mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.  
 
 After her step-father passed away in 2004, Applicant took on the responsibility of 
supporting her mother. At that time, she was a single mother and struggled to support 
her mother and meet other financial obligations. This was a condition beyond her 
control that contributed to her financial problems. She made a bad decision by not 
timely filing her federal and state income tax returns for 2005, 2006, 2009, and 2010 
because she did not have the money to pay the taxes that were due. She rectified that 
tax filing error between 2010 and 2012. She also made a bad decision by not having 
enough tax withholdings from her pay and ended up owing the IRS a significant amount 
in past-due taxes. In 2012, she entered into a repayment plan with the IRS to resolve 
her past-due tax issue. AG 20(b) partially applies. 
 
 In 2012 and 2015, Applicant paid the alleged delinquent debts. Each SOR 
allegation has been resolved. She is now married and financially stable. Her previous 
financial problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on her current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) 
apply. 
 
 
7 
 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole-person concept. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under 
the Guideline F analysis, but some warrant additional comment. 
 Applicant honorably served in the military for 22 years. She is a valued 
employee in her current job. She has held a security clearance for many years. She 
encountered financial problems, but has either taken or is taking sufficient steps to 
resolve those issues. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or 
doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these 
reasons, I conclude that Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security 
concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
      Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.e:    For Applicant 
 
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
