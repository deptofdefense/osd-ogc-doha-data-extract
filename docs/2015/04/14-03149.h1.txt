DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 6, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F. DOD CAF took that action under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD CAF could not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

On August 28, 2014, Applicant answered the SOR and did not request a hearing. 
Department Counsel requested the hearing on September 23, 2014. This case was 
assigned to me on January 22, 2015. On February 10, 2015, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Video Teleconference Hearing. The 
hearing was held as scheduled on February 19, 2015. Applicant waived the 15-day 
advance notice requirement for the hearing in ¶ E3.1.8 of the Directive.1 
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, 
while Applicant testified and offered Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through F. Department 
Counsel’s list of exhibits was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1 and Applicant’s list of 
exhibits was marked as HE 2. The record of the proceeding was left open until February 
26, 2015, to provide Applicant an opportunity to present additional matters. Applicant 
timely submitted additional documents that were marked as AE G through L. All 
proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. The transcript (Tr.) of 
the hearing was received on March 2, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for 
her current employer since September 2011. She served on active duty in the U.S. 
Navy from September 1973 to September 1980 and in the active Navy Reserve from 
September 1990 to September 1996. She received honorable discharges for her 
military service. She earned an associate’s degree in 1983 and a bachelor’s degree in 
1993. She married in 1977 and divorced in 1997. She has one adult child. She first held 
a security clearance in about 1974 and has held one for various periods over the years.2 
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file her federal income tax returns for 
2005, 2009, 2011, and 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and failed to file her state income tax returns 
for 2009 and 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.b). In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted both 
allegations with explanations. Her admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.3 
 
Applicant attributed her income tax return filing delinquencies to being a victim of 
a hurricane and to her multiple residential moves. In 2005, she was living in an area that 
was hit by a hurricane. Her apartment was flooded, and she suffered a significant 
casualty loss that was physically disruptive. Between 2009 and 2011, she moved six 
times, including two interstate moves. She indicated the multiple moves resulted in tax 
documents being packed up and relocated.4

In her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), Applicant 
disclosed that she had not filed her 2005, 2009, and 2011 income tax returns as 
required. Her reason for not filing them was: 
 
I paid my taxes, but did not properly file. You are not required to file for 
Federal taxes as long as you don’t owe anything. I will eventually file just 
to clear the books and get the refund owed to me. I’ve had 3 employers 
and 5 addresses in the last 2 years. I’ll get everything caught up once I’m 
settled.5   
 
In an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview in May 2013, Applicant 
admitted that she procrastinated in filing her income tax returns and reportedly stated 
that she had no excuse for failing to file them. She also stated that she had received 
letters from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about her failure to file the income tax 
returns, but still had not filed the tax returns.6 
 
In June 2014, Applicant hired a certified public accountant (CPA) to provide 
financial planning advice and later hired the CPA to assist her in completing the 
delinquent income tax returns. She provided proof that she filed each of the past-due 
income tax returns. The following table provides information on her federal income tax 
returns.

She also provided documentation showing that the IRS received her 2008 federal 
income tax return on September 18, 2014. Her failure to file her 2008 federal income tax 
return as required was not alleged in the SOR. Due to her delays in filing the 2005 and

2008 federal income tax returns, she was ineligible to receive tax refunds for those 
years.7 
 
 In 2009 and 2011, Applicant was a part-time resident of a state that imposed an 
income tax. She provided a document from that state showing her state income tax 
returns for those years were completed. The state processed those tax returns in 
February 2015. She overpaid her state income tax by $168 in 2009 and $46 in 2011. 
Whether she was entitled to refunds for those years due to the delays in filing the tax 
returns is unknown.8 
 
At the hearing, Applicant testified that she overpaid her income taxes each year. 
She also noted that, when she submitted tax filing extensions some years, she 
submitted additional payments to make sure her tax obligation was paid. She initially 
believed she did not need to file her income tax returns if she did not owe any further 
taxes. In 2014, she sought financial planning advice from a CPA on an issue concerning 
her parents. During that meeting, she learned that she had a legal obligation to file her 
income tax returns even though she did not owe any additional money. She hired the 
CPA to prepare her past-due income tax returns. She testified that all of her income tax 
returns have since been filed, including her 2013 and 2014 income tax returns. She 
stated that, although she received letters from the IRS about her failure to file income 
tax returns, she interpreted those as friendly reminders. She thought that filing the 
income tax returns was something that could wait and did not believe she was doing 
anything wrong. With her multiple moves, she also noted that she may not have 
received all of the IRS’s letters. She now realizes that she has a legal obligation and a 
civic duty to file her income tax returns in a timely manner and that failure to file federal 
income tax returns could constitute a criminal offense. She plans to hire the CPA to 
assist her in filing her income tax returns in the future. She noted that she already 
created a filing system for storing her 2015 tax records as they are received.9 
 
Applicant is financially stable. She submitted a credit report dated August 12, 
2014, showing she had no delinquent accounts.10

Applicant presented character reference letters from coworkers that described 
her as a hardworking, conscientious, and trustworthy individual. Her employer considers 
her a valued employee. She has received letters of appreciation from flag officers and 
work performance awards. Her work performance appraisals indicated that she 
consistently exceeded expectations and requirements.11  
 
In the Navy, Applicant was awarded the Good Conduct Medal and National 
Defense Service Medal. For the past ten years, she served as a volunteer in the U.S. 
Coast Guard Auxiliary and received a letter of commendation from the Commandant of 
the Coast Guard for her contributions.12 
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, to reach his decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
                                                          
11 Tr. 34-44; AE E, H-L.  
12 Tr. 40-43; AE E. 
 
6 
 
 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
“Failure to discharge legal obligations, such as filing tax returns, can impugn an 
applicant’s judgment and reliability.”13 Record evidence established the following 
disqualifying condition under AG ¶ 19:   
 
                                                          
13 ISCR Case No. 12-00608 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 11, 2014) (citing ISCR Case No. 98-0810 at 4 
(App. Bd. Jun.8. 2000). 
 
7 
 
 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required or the fraudulent filing of the same. 
 
  Three mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
and 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control.  
 
 Applicant’s tax return filing delinquencies were recent and repetitive. These 
delinquencies occurred because she did not understand the filing requirements. 
Because she is now aware of the filing requirements, such delinquencies are unlikely to 
recur. AG ¶ 20(a) partially applies. 
 
 Applicant was the victim of a hurricane in 2005. She made multiple residential 
moves between 2009 and 2011. However, she acknowledged that she procrastinated in 
filing her tax returns. AG ¶ 20(b) minimally applies.  
 
 Applicant paid her income taxes. When she applied for filing extensions, she 
would occasionally make additional payments to ensure she had no tax deficiency. 
Nevertheless, the legal obligation to file income tax returns in a timely manner is 
independent of whether an applicant owes additional taxes or is entitled to a refund. I 
am cognizant that the Appeal Board has recognized that an administrative judge may 
place too much weight on an applicant’s claim that he or she was entitled to tax refunds 
when analyzing cases of this nature. The primary issue here is a failure to comply with 
legal requirements.14  
 
 Credible evidence was presented to show that Applicant lacked an 
understanding of the tax filing requirements. During her meeting with a CPA for another 
matter in 2014, she was informed of her legal obligation to file income tax returns even 
though she owed no additional taxes. Upon learning of that requirement, she hired the 
CPA to prepare those tax returns. The past-due tax returns have been filed. Now that 
                                                          
14 ISCR Case No. 94-0964 at 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 1996).

she is aware of the legal requirement, she intends to file her income tax returns in a 
timely manner in the future. Her financial problem has been resolved. AG ¶ 20(c) 
applies.   
 
 Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).  
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant served honorably in the Navy for eight years and in the Navy Reserve 
for six years. She is a valued employee of a defense contractor. She had held a security 
clearance for many years without any apparent problems. She is an active volunteer in 
the Coast Guard Auxiliary. She failed to file her tax returns in a timely manner due to a 
lack of understanding of the requirements. She corrected that error by filing the past-
due tax returns. Now that she is aware of the requirement, it is unlikely she will fail to 
meet the filing requirements in the future.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all the above reasons, I 
conclude that Applicant mitigated the financial consideration security concerns. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is granted.
