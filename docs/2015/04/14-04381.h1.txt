GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations and personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to 
classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 8, 2014, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application.1 On September 17, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, 
pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the DOD on September

1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and 
E (Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators could not make 
an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 2, 2014. In a sworn 
statement, dated October 21, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On December 15, 2014, 
Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed. The case was 
assigned to me on January 13, 2015. A Notice of Hearing was issued on February 13, 
2015. I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on March 11, 2015. 
 
 During the hearing, 3 Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 3) and 13 Applicant 
exhibits (AE A through AE M) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
and one witness testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on March 25, 
2015. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. She took advantage 
of that opportunity. She submitted additional documents that were marked as AE N 
through AE X and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on April 
6, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted four of the factual allegations in the 
SOR under financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d.), gave mixed responses to five 
other allegations (¶¶ 1.e. through 1.i.), and denied the factual allegation under personal 
conduct (¶ 2.a.). During the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to 
conform to the evidence presented. The first proposed amendment, identified as ¶ 1.j., 
related to financial considerations, was essentially that Applicant had failed to file her 
state income tax returns for the tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013.2 The second 
proposed amendment, related to personal conduct, was to amend ¶ 2.a., by adding the 
words “and 1.j.,” to the existing allegation.3 Applicant admitted both allegations but 
objected to their inclusion into the SOR.4 Nevertheless, I granted the motion to amend 
the SOR and gave Applicant an additional period to formally admit or deny those 
allegations.5 Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact.

Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been 
serving as a military family life counselor since November 2012.6 She served in the 
same position as a self-employed independent contractor from August 2009 until 
November 2012.7 Applicant is also an adjunct professor at a local university.8 A June 
1996 high school graduate,9 Applicant received a bachelor of arts degree in psychology 
in June 2000 and a master’s degree in social work in May 2005.10 She currently holds 
the designations master of social work (MSW) and licensed clinical social worker 
(LCSW).11 She has never been granted a security clearance.12 Applicant has never 
served with the United States military.13 She has never been married.14  
 
Financial Considerations 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until 2010. Applicant 
generally prepared and filed her federal and state income tax returns before the tax year 
2009, either by herself or with the assistance of a nationally recognized income tax 
preparation service.15 With respect to her income tax return for the tax year 2009, 
because of her purported heavy traveling schedule, Applicant engaged the professional 
services of an accountant and asked for a filing extension. However, on an unspecified 
date, Applicant’s accountant filed her federal and state income tax returns for that tax 
year without Applicant’s authorization and retained the approximately $4,500 refund 
received from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Applicant attempted to resolve the 
issue without resorting to legal action and hoped to do so before proceeding with the 
next year’s income tax filing due-date.16 It is unclear if the issue was ever resolved. 
Applicant acknowledged that she kept poor records, experienced salary changes, 
and was constantly moving around, so she went to new accountants for the tax years 
2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013.17 Each year, timely extensions were requested to enable

her to get organized and gather the appropriate tax records.18 Applicant had intended to 
timely file her income tax returns herself, but she failed to do so. She attributed her 
failures to a variety of factors: she had a heavy work schedule; she was overwhelmed 
by her tax issues; her tax bracket had changed significantly; it was beyond her scope of 
expertise to prepare her taxes independently; she did not sufficiently dedicate time to 
manage her taxes; she wanted to deal with her accountants face-to-face, but could not 
because she was uncomfortable taking time off from work; and she lacked the 
education and knowledge to comply with her filing responsibilities. Her accountants kept 
reminding her of her deadlines and responsibilities, and gave her recommendations to 
follow, which she failed to do, and advised her that she was accruing significant fees 
and penalties.19 Applicant understood that she would owe taxes for the tax years 2010 
through 2012, but not for 2013.20 When she completed her e-QIP in April 2014, 
Applicant indicated that she expected to have her income tax issues resolved by April 
15, 2014.21 They were not. 
Applicant was temporarily assigned overseas on government business from June 
2010 until August 2010, from June 2011 until August 2011, and from June 2012 until 
August 2012.22  She also claimed that she was “literally traveling, probably, 52 weeks 
out of the year.”23 Applicant offered no documentation to support her claim of a heavy 
travel schedule, especially during periods when her income tax returns were required to 
be filed, either on the regular due dates or on the extended filing due dates. 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): On April 10, 2012, the IRS issued Applicant an inquiry regarding 
the non-filing of her federal income tax return for the tax year 2010.24 There was no 
evidence that an extension of time to file the income tax return was ever filed.25 On 
October 22, 2014 – one month after the SOR was issued – Applicant finally filed that 
income tax return.26 In February 2015, it was determined that she owed $9,074.15, 
including tax, interest, and penalty charges.27 She made payments of $4,028, $3,000, 
and $1,000, and received a credit of $400.28 As of April 6, 2015, Applicant’s balance is

an overpayment of $1,631.78, which according to Applicant will be applied to any 
remaining balance at a later date.29 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): On April 15, 2013, the IRS issued Applicant an inquiry regarding 
the non-filing of her federal income tax return for the tax year 2011.30 It was noted that 
she had previously requested an extension of time to file the income tax return on April 
17, 2012.31 On October 6, 2014 – less than a month after the SOR was issued – 
Applicant finally filed that income tax return.32 In January 2015, the IRS issued a notice 
of intent to seize her state tax refund or other property, and demanded an immediate 
payment of $11,135.82, including tax, interest, and penalty charges.33 A refund of 
$5,167 from her 2013 income tax refund was applied to her account in April 2014.34 
Applicant entered into a repayment plan for the remaining balance of approximately 
$3,997.35 She made payments of $3,000 on March 9, 2015 and $1,000 on March 10, 
2015.36  
 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): On September 2, 2014, Applicant finally filed her federal income tax 
return for the tax year 2012.37 An extension of time to file the income tax return had 
been filed on April 15, 2013.38 In January 2015, the IRS issued a notice of intent to 
seize her state tax refund or other property, and demanded an immediate payment of 
$887.13, including tax and interest charges.39 By April 6, 2015, the balance increased to 
$893.27.40 In October 2014, Applicant was informed that her balance for the tax year 
2012 was determined to be $2,398.41 She made a payment in that amount on October 
28, 2014.42

(SOR ¶ 1.d.): Applicant requested an extension of time to file the income tax 
return for the tax year 2013, so she could focus on her earlier delinquent income tax 
returns.43 She anticipated filing the actual income tax return by November 14, 2014.44 In 
October 2014, the IRS advised her that she would be due a refund of approximately 
$2,300 for the tax year, and that amount would be applied to any remaining balances.45 
Applicant contends she finally filed the income tax return on January 10, 2015,46 but she 
failed to submit any documentation to support her contention. In February 2015, she 
was advised that the earlier balance was incorrect, and that it was actually 
approximately $5,200. That amount was purportedly applied to the remaining balances 
of her earlier income tax liabilities.47  
 
(SOR ¶ 1.j.): Applicant did not timely file her state income tax returns for the tax 
years 2010, 2011, 2012, or 2013.48 The tax returns for the first three years were filed in 
September 2014,49 and the return for the tax year 2013 was expected to be filed in April 
2015.50 Applicant anticipated owing the state approximately $2,300 in unpaid state 
income taxes,51 and in November 2014 she entered into a payment agreement with the 
state department of revenue. Under that agreement, commencing on December 28, 
2014, $200 would be withdrawn from Applicant’s bank account each month until the 
actual balance of $1,885.74, plus any accrued interest, is satisfied.52 Applicant offered 
no documentation to indicate that her state income tax return for the tax year 2013 has 
yet been filed. 
 
In addition to her delinquent federal and state income tax returns for the tax 
years 2010 through 2013, the issue of whether or not she expected to timely file her 
federal and state income tax returns for the tax year 2014 was raised since they were 
due to be filed approximately four weeks after the hearing was conducted. Applicant 
stated that she had educated herself on being able to utilize software programs to run 
reports pertaining to her finances to submit to her accountant.53 She believed she was 
on schedule to have her income tax returns completed before the filing due date.54 She

has not submitted any documentation to indicate that the federal and state income tax 
returns for the tax year 2014 have yet been filed.  
 
The SOR also identified five purportedly continuing delinquencies, as reflected by 
a credit report from April 2014,55 totaling approximately $503. Applicant offered no 
explanations as to how or why those particular accounts became delinquent. Those 
debts listed in the SOR and their respective current status, according to the credit 
report, other evidence in the case file, and Applicant’s admissions regarding the same, 
are described below. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): There is a medical account with an unidentified provider in the 
amount of $160 that was placed for collection in 2012.56 When Applicant discussed the 
account with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in 
May 2014, she was not familiar with it.57 She subsequently contended that she had 
resolved the account, effective October 21, 2014, and she furnished a confirmation 
number.58 Other than a number, Applicant did not submit any documentation such as a 
cancelled check, receipt, or letter from the creditor to support her contention that the 
account has been resolved. Instead, she noted that the account is no longer listed in her 
most recent credit report.59 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): There is another medical account with an unidentified provider in 
the amount of $112 that was placed for collection in 2011.60 Applicant was not familiar 
with the account when she discussed it with the OPM investigator in May 2014.61 Once 
again, she subsequently contended that the account had been resolved, effective 
October 21, 2014, and she furnished a confirmation number.62 Other than a number, 
Applicant did not submit any documentation, such as a cancelled check, receipt, or 
letter from the creditor to support her contention that the account has been resolved. 
However, it should be noted that the account is listed in her most recent credit report, 
and it is reflected as paid in full.63

was not revealed. Nevertheless, Applicant’s net worth, without describing the assets 
considered, is $44,683.79.79 It is unclear if she has any monthly remainder available for 
discretionary savings or spending. In February 2015, Applicant attended a one-hour 
webinar generally described as financial self-care for personal and professional use.80 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
 (SOR ¶ 2.a.): As noted above, Applicant failed to timely file her federal and state 
income tax returns for 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013.  
 
Character References and Work Performance 
 
 A coworker/friend has known Applicant for approximately 12 years, and they 
interact with each other on a daily basis. They also served on the ethics committee and 
as local chairs of a national professional organization. Applicant has been characterized 
as a very upstanding person with a reputation for honesty and truthfulness.81 Applicant 
informed her of her tax problems from the very beginning and she believes that 
Applicant was overwhelmed by the issue because:82 
 
she lacked the cultural capital, social capital, just to be able to work with 
the accountant, or . . . do it on her own. . . . She is very independent, she 
wants to be able to do things, on her own. . . . She just got overwhelmed 
with trying to compile everything, keeping up with everything. 
 
 Another LCSW has known Applicant for nearly ten years since Applicant 
mentored her with her MSW degree. She noted that Applicant is well respected, and 
she has been selected for various leadership positions, asked to participate in 
community activities, and given awards within the community and their profession.83 
Applicant was awarded recognition by military battalion commanders for her support 
and service to military service members and their families.84  
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security

emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”85 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”86   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”87 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.88  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”89 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”90 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. In addition, a “failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax 
returns as required. . .” may raise security concerns under AG ¶ 19(g). Applicant failed 
to timely file her federal and state income tax returns for 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. 
She allowed five medical accounts to become delinquent and to be placed for collection. 
AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or

occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”91  
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) partially apply.  AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) do not apply. 
Applicant acknowledged that she kept poor records, experienced salary changes, and 
was constantly moving around, so she went to new accountants for the tax years 2010, 
2011, 2012, and 2013. Each year, timely extensions were requested to enable her to 
get organized and gather the appropriate tax records, and each year she intended to 
timely file her income tax returns herself. She routinely failed to do so and attributed her 
failures to a variety of factors: she had a heavy work schedule; she was overwhelmed 
by her tax issues; her tax bracket had changed significantly; it was beyond her scope of 
expertise to prepare her taxes independently; she did not sufficiently dedicate time to 
manage her taxes; she wanted to deal with her accountants face-to-face, but could not 
because she was uncomfortable taking time off from work; and she lacked the 
education and knowledge to comply with her filing responsibilities. None of those factors 
appeared to be beyond Applicant’s control. 
Applicant’s accountants kept reminding her of her deadlines and responsibilities, 
and gave her recommendations to follow, which she failed to do, and they advised her 
that she was accruing significant fees and penalties. Nevertheless, Applicant 
procrastinated and took no action. When she completed her e-QIP in April 2014, 
Applicant indicated that she expected to have her income tax issues resolved by April 
15, 2014. They were not.  Applicant’s behavior continued over the years until she finally 
filed her federal income tax return for the tax year 2013 in January 2015. Applicant’s 
procrastination over the timely filing of her income tax returns started in 2009, continued 
after the SOR was issued in 2014, and was finally seemingly resolved in 2015. That 
                                                          
91
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

behavior was frequent and, notwithstanding her perceived explanatory factors, willful. In 
the absence of clear demonstrations that her behavior has been modified, there is 
nothing to indicate that it is unlikely to recur.   
While Applicant has received guidance from her accountants, she essentially 
ignored their guidance. She attended a one-hour webinar generally described as 
financial self care for personal and professional use, but no other specific description of 
the topic was furnished.  Applicant has presented some evidence showing that she may 
have resolved some of delinquent medical accounts and her income tax issues. She 
offered no explanations for her delinquent medical accounts. Even though she may 
have resolved some of her accounts, her efforts, generated largely by the issuance of 
the SOR, do not support a conclusion that they were good-faith efforts. In the absence 
of some indication of Applicant’s current monthly net income, and a monthly remainder 
after paying routine monthly expenses, it is difficult to determine if Applicant’s financial 
problems are under control. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances presented 
continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.92 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG & 15:       
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
 The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 16(d), it is potentially disqualifying if there is 
 
credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other 
guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, 
but which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-
person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not 
properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited 
to consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. . . .  
 
Under AG ¶ 16(e), it is also potentially disqualifying if there is 
personal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, that 
creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . .

engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person’s personal, 
professional, or community standing. . . . 
Applicant failed to timely file her federal and state income tax returns for 2010, 2011, 
2012, and 2013. AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(e) have been established. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from personal conduct. AG ¶ 17(c) may apply if “the offense is so 
minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened 
under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, AG ¶ 17(e) may 
apply if “the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to 
exploitation, manipulation, or duress.”  
AG ¶¶ 17(c) and 17(e) do not apply. As noted above, Applicant’s accountants 
kept reminding her of her deadlines and responsibilities, and gave her 
recommendations to follow, which she failed to do. Instead, Applicant procrastinated 
and took no action. In April 2014, she indicated that she expected to have her income 
tax issues resolved by April 15, 2014. They were not.  Applicant’s behavior continued 
over the years until she finally filed her federal income tax return for the tax year 2013 in 
January 2015. Applicant’s procrastination over the timely filing of her income tax returns 
started in 2009, continued after the SOR was issued in 2014, and was seemingly 
resolved in 2015. They reflect Applicant’s cavalier attitude towards her legal 
responsibilities for timely filing income tax returns, as well as her questionable 
judgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with established rules and 
regulations. 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
15 
                                      
 
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s behavior. Applicant is a 
highly-thought-of professional LCSW, who is a positive influence on her community and 
her colleagues. Applicant finally filed her federal and state income tax returns for 2010, 
2011, 2012, and 2013. She has paid off delinquent medical accounts.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial 
than the mitigating evidence. Applicant routinely failed to timely file her federal and state 
income tax returns over a multi-year period despite having the assistance and guidance 
of accountants and professional income tax return preparers – assistance and guidance 
she rejected. Timely extensions were usually requested to enable her to get organized 
and gather the appropriate tax records, and each year she intended to timely file her 
income tax returns herself. Instead, she procrastinated and routinely failed to do so. The 
IRS issued Applicant several inquiries regarding the non-filing of some of her federal 
income tax returns, but those inquiries were followed by Applicant’s continued inaction. 
Likewise, the IRS issued notices of intent to seize her state tax refunds or other 
property, and demanded immediate payments. Most of her delinquent federal and state 
income tax returns were not filed until after the SOR was issued. The same is true for 
her delinquent medical accounts. 
Applicant’s behavior, consisting of a combination of consternation and 
procrastination, continued over several years. That behavior was frequent and, 
notwithstanding her perceived explanatory factors, willful. In the absence of clear 
demonstrations that her behavior has been modified, there is nothing to indicate that it 
is unlikely to recur.   
Applicant has demonstrated a very poor track record of timely filing federal and 
state income tax returns and maintaining her medical accounts. Her explanations for 
those failures are simply not credible. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with 
substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security 
clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security 
concerns arising from her financial considerations and personal conduct. See AG ¶ 
2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:    For Applicant 
 
16 
                                      
 
Subparagraph 1.h:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.i:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.j:    Against Applicant 
 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a:    Against Applicant 
     
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
