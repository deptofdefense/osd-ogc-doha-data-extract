HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges seven delinquent or charged-off 
debts totaling $1,795,085. Four mortgage debts on three condominiums were owed to 
the same creditor and accounted for $1,789,824 of this debt. The creditor-bank 
foreclosed on the three condominiums. Applicant received IRS Form 1099-As on two of 
the condominium debts. The creditor obtained a $500,000 judgment on the third 
condominium debt, and this debt is unresolved. The other six SOR debts are resolved. 
Applicant did not make sufficient progress resolving this $500,000 judgment. Financial 
considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 23, 2013, Applicant signed and submitted an Electronic Questionnaires 
for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86). (GE 1) On August 7, 2014, the 
Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an 
SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which 
became effective on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(HE 2) The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF could not make the affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) 
 
On November 20, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) On February 
10, 2015, Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On February 24, 2015, DOHA 
assigned the case to me. On March 18, 2015, DOHA issued a notice of the hearing, 
setting the hearing for March 24, 2015. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled 
using video teleconference. Applicant waived his right to 15 days of notice of the date, 
time, and place of the hearing. (Tr. 10-11) Department Counsel offered four exhibits into 
evidence, and Applicant offered two exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 12-13, 16-19; GE 1-4; 
AE A, B) There were no objections, and I admitted all proffered exhibits into evidence. 
(Tr. 16-19; GE 1-4; AE A, B) After his hearing, I received a complete copy of his March 
19, 2015 credit report, which was admitted without objection. (AE C) On April 1, 2015, I 
received the transcript of the hearing.

Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges seven debts totaling $1,795,085 as follows: 1.a is a real 
estate mortgage debt for $550,505; 1.b is a real estate mortgage debt for $451,270 past 
due in the amount of $59,911; 1.c is a real estate mortgage debt for $386,094 past due 
in the amount of $64,706; 1.d is a real estate mortgage debt for $401,955; 1.e is a 
delinquent bank credit card debt for $5,148; 1.f is a delinquent debt for $62; and 1.g is a 
delinquent debt for $51.  
 
Applicant purchased three condominiums as investments in 2005, 2006, and 
2007, utilizing mortgage financing from the same bank. (Tr. 20-21, 35) The fourth SOR 
mortgage was a line of credit secured by the condominium. (Tr. 21) The three 
mortgages each had a balloon payment requirement, and when the payment was due, 
Applicant asked the creditor to refinance; however, in 2010, the creditor wanted 
Applicant to pay down the mortgages or refinance with a different bank because the 
properties were appraised at a lower value than the amount owed on the mortgages or 
in other words, the mortgages were “underwater.” (Tr. 22, 36-38) An oil spill in the area 
further suppressed economic activity in the area and the value of the condominiums 
declined. (Tr. 26) He rented the three properties; however, he said he lost about 
$10,000 each year on each unit. (Tr. 36)  
 
In 2010, Applicant stopped making payments to the creditor holding the 
mortgages on the condominiums to facilitate short sales of the properties; however, he 
continued to collect rent from his tenants. (Tr. 23, 66-67) Applicant presented a short-
sale contract to the creditor; however, it was not accepted. (Tr. 24) Applicant had equity 
lines of credit on all of the condominiums. (Tr. 25)   
 
The bank foreclosed on the three condominiums, and Applicant received two IRS 
Form 1099-As. (Tr. 27, 41) The 2011 1099-A shows a fair market value of $67,900 and 
the lien balance outstanding of $338,248. (Tr. 42) The 2013 1099-A shows a fair market 
value of $440,000 and the balance outstanding of $398,000. (Tr. 43) His credit report 
indicated a score of 747. (Tr. 28)  
 
As for the condominium without an IRS Form 1099-A, Applicant initially borrowed 
$550,000 (SOR ¶ 1.a), and as the condominium rapidly appreciated, he borrowed an 
additional $400,000 on this condominium (SOR ¶ 1.d). (Tr. 39, 64-65) In 2012 or 2013, 
after the foreclosure, the creditor obtained a judgment against Applicant for $500,000. 
(Tr. 40, 68) This judgment was not listed on his credit report. (Tr. 40) He did not make 
any payment to address the $500,000 debt. (Tr. 46) He said he was willing to work with 
the creditor on the $500,000 debt. (Tr. 54-55)  
 
Applicant said the credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.e for $5,148 was owed to a 
creditor that was no longer in business. (Tr. 26, 47) It was a business debt owed by his 
building supply and construction company, and Applicant had no personal liability to pay 
it. (Tr. 51) The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f for $62 and 1.g for $51 were owed to a telephone 
company. (Tr. 26, 51) Applicant said he resolved the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g by 
paying the debts. (Tr. 27)

Applicant paid off and refinanced his mortgage on his residence, and his car 
loans are current. (Tr. 28, 53) His monthly mortgage payment is about $3,000. (Tr. 57) 
He said all of his debts are current (except for the $500,000 judgment). (Tr. 52, 63) 
Applicant’s March 19, 2015 TransUnion credit score is 747, and his March 19, 2015 
Equifax credit score is 768, which are considered good or excellent scores. (AE A and 
B)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, SOR response, and hearing record. Applicant’s SOR alleges seven 
delinquent or charged-off debts totaling $1,795,085. He owned three condominiums that 
went to foreclosure when he stopped making payments on the mortgages. A creditor 
obtained a $500,000 judgment against Applicant to address the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d. The 
Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring 
additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
  
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;2 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
None of the mitigating conditions apply to all of his SOR allegations. 
Nevertheless, there is some mitigating financial information. Applicant’s delinquent debt 
initially resulted from a reduction of real estate values due to an oil spill and the real 
estate crash that occurred in 2008 to 2009. After substantial appreciation in value from 
2007 to 2008, Applicant’s three condominiums were worth dramatically less in late 2010 
than their mortgages. The oil spill and the decline in the real estate market are 
circumstances beyond his control under AG ¶ 20(b). In 2010, he stopped making 
payments on the mortgages; however, he continued to collect rent from tenants. Other 
than the condominium mortgages, he maintained his other debts in current status.   
 
The creditor for the mortgage in SOR ¶ 1.d obtained a judgment in Applicant’s 
state of residence for $500,000. There is no evidence that the creditor for the other 
mortgages is seeking reimbursement for the losses on the other loans. AG ¶ 20(e) does 
not apply to any of his debts because he did not provide “documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the 
issue.”   
 
 Applicant did not provide a detailed budget. He did not provide a copy of any 
offer to settle, proposed payment plan, or a credible explanation for his failure to begin 
making payments to address the $500,000 debt. He did not take reasonable and 
responsible actions to resolve this debt. The record lacked clear indications the problem 
is being resolved and is under control. He did not receive financial counseling. He did 
not establish that he was unable to make more progress resolving the $500,000 debt. 
His efforts are insufficient to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  
 
 Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant or reinstate eligibility for 
a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting Applicant’s continued access to classified 
information; however, this evidence is not sufficient to mitigate security concerns.  
Applicant is 64 years old, and he owns 90 percent of a residential construction or supply 
company that he has operated for 15 years. In 2014, Applicant made about $90,000 
from a company. He also buys and sells real estate. He served in the Coast Guard from 
1969 to 1973; and he received an honorable discharge. He is a disabled veteran, and 
his monthly take home pay is about $8,000. He seeks a security clearance to enable 
him to be a consultant on classified DOD contracts. In 1976, he received a bachelor’s 
degree in business. Applicant paid off and refinanced his mortgage on his residence, 
and his car loans are current. His credit report reflects a score of 747, and he said all of 
his debts are current or resolved (except the $500,000 judgment on his condominium).  
 
The factors weighing towards reinstatement of Applicant’s security clearance are 
less substantial than the factors weighing against its reinstatement. Applicant purchased 
three condominiums as investments in 2005, 2006, and 2007, utilizing financing from 
the same bank. He invested about $550,000 in one condominium, and as the 
condominium rapidly appreciated, he borrowed an additional $455,000 on this 
condominium. In 2010, Applicant stopped making payments on the three condominiums 
to facilitate short sales of the properties; however, he continued to collect rent from the 
tenants. The bank foreclosed on the three condominiums, and Applicant received two 
IRS Form 1099-As. In 2012 or 2013, the creditor obtained a judgment against Applicant 
for $500,000 for a debt arising from the foreclosure of the third condominium. He did not 
make any payments to address the $500,000 debt.   
 
Applicant did not show sufficient progress resolving the $500,000 judgment to 
establish there are clear indications the problem is being resolved and his finances are 
under control. He did not provide a detailed budget or provide a credible plan for 
resolution of this debt. He did not act responsibly under the circumstances, and his 
financial problems are likely to continue. The record does not show enough evidence of 
his inability to pay this debt, documented financial progress, financial effort, good 
judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability to warrant mitigation of financial considerations 
security concerns at this time.  
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. Unmitigated financial considerations concerns lead me to conclude 
that reinstatement of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this time. This 
decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not 
attain the state of reform necessary to justify the award of a security clearance in the 
future. With more effort towards resolving his past-due debt, and a track record of

behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive 
evidence of his worthiness for a security clearance.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude Applicant has not carried 
his burden and financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access 
to classified information is denied. 
 
Formal Findings

Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
 Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.c:  For Applicant 
    Subparagraph 1.d:   Against Applicant 
    Subparagraphs 1.e to 1.g:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
