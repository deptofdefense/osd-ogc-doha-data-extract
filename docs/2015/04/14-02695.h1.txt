Decision
______________
HENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:
Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, Applicant’s
eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations
Processing (e-QIP) on April 22, 2013. The Department of Defense (DOD) issued
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on August 7, 2014, detailing security concerns
under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The
action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as
amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines For Determining Eligibility for
Access to Classified Information (AG), implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
GE 1; Tr. 19-20, 29.1

Applicant received the SOR in August 2014. His initial answer dated August 26,
2014 was not received.  The SOR was resent to him on October 27, 2014. He received
it on November 12, 2014. He submitted a second answer dated December 1, 2014,
which was received on December 8, 2014. Applicant requested a hearing before an
administrative judge with the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).
Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 7, 2015, and I received the
case assignment on February 23, 2015. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 4,
2015, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 25, 2015. The Government
offered one exhibit marked as GE 1, which was received and admitted into evidence
without objection. Applicant testified. He submitted exhibits (AE) marked as AE A
through AE D, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. The
record closed on March 25, 2015. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 2,
2015.
Procedural Rulings
Notice
 Applicant received the notice of the date, time and place of the hearing less than
15 days before the hearing. I advised Applicant of his right under ¶ E3.1.8. of the
Directive to receive the notice at least 15 days before the hearing. Applicant
affirmatively waived this right under the Directive. (Tr. 12)
Motions
At the hearing, Department Counsel motioned to amend allegation 1.c of the
SOR to change the date from 2010 to 2009. Applicant did not object. The motion was
granted. SOR allegation 1.c is amended to change the date from 2010 to 2009. (Tr. 9)
Findings of Fact
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in ¶¶ 1.a -
1.c and 2.a of the SOR. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. He
also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security
clearance. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the
following findings of fact. 
 Applicant, who is 55 years old, works as a senior engineer in hardware and
software development for a DOD contractor. He began his current employment two
years ago. From October 2008 until February 2013, Applicant was a self-employed
engineer. During part of this time, he formed his own business, and he continued to
perform similar work for his clients.1
GE 1; Tr. 17-18.2
At the time of the hearing, his income tax returns for the tax year 2014 were not due and not yet filed.3
Tr. 19-20, 24-25, 27, 29, 32, 41.4
AE B; Tr. 215
Applicant believes this was the refund he was entitled to receive in 2012.6
Applicant also believes this money came from the refund he was entitled to receive in 2013.7
AE B; Tr. 21-23. The SOR inaccurately states that Applicant filed his 2009 tax return in 2013.8
3
Applicant graduated from college in December 1982 with a bachelor of science
degree in electrical engineering. He and his wife married in April 1989. They have two
sons, ages 23 and 15.2
Applicant filed his first income tax return in 1977. He timely filed annual federal
and state income tax returns through the tax year 2013,  except for the tax years 20093
and 2010. He has no explanation for not filing his income tax returns with the federal
and state governments for these years. He recalls losing the folder with all the tax
information related to his self-employment income in 2010. He has not been able to
locate this folder.4
On April 15, 2010, Applicant filed a request for an extension of time to file his
2009 federal income tax return with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS
granted him until October 15, 2010 to file his return. He did not file his 2009 income tax
return by that date. On March 15, 2011, Applicant called the IRS with a request for
information about non-filing of taxes.5
Two days before his security clearance hearing, Applicant requested and
received from the IRS a tax account transcript for the tax year 2009. Besides the
extension information, the IRS transcript reflects that the IRS completed a substitute tax
return on July 16, 2012. Based on the information in its records, the IRS determined
Applicant’s adjusted gross income for 2009 at $82,170, his taxable income at $72,820,
and his filing status as married filing separately. The transcript reflects that the IRS
received $10,664 in taxes withheld by employers and a $236 payment by Applicant on
April 15, 2010. When asked about this payment, Applicant expressed his belief he had
computed his taxes, determined he owed this additional amount of taxes, and made a
payment. On April 15, 2012, the IRS transferred $4,064 from Applicant’s 2011 tax
refund and applied the money to his 2009 tax account.  On February 18, 2013, the IRS6
computed his 2009 tax liability at $14,520 and assessed him penalties for late filing and
late payment of taxes at $1,581. On April 15, 2013, the IRS transferred $1,140 from his
2012 income tax refund to his 2009 tax account.  The tax transcript reflects that7
Applicant has a zero balance for his 2009 tax account. As of the hearing, he had not
filed his 2009 tax return (1040 form).8

Applicant signed his 2010 1040 federal income tax return on March 23, 2015,
which he indicated has been filed. On this same date, he requested and received a tax
transcript from the IRS for the tax year 2010. The tax transcript indicates that a tax
return had not yet been filed; that Applicant timely requested an extension of time to file
his federal tax return on April 15, 2011; that the IRS has not prepared a substitute tax
return; that Applicant paid $13,000 in estimated taxes on January 21, 2011; and that his
tax account had a negative balance of $13,000. Applicant’s recently prepared and
submitted his 2010 tax return, which shows a total income of $98,712, including
$47,000 from an early IRA account distribution. Applicant had $9,567 withheld from this
distribution for taxes. He paid the IRS $22,567 in total taxes for the tax year 2010. His
completed return indicated that he was entitled to a tax refund of $9,298. He anticipates
the IRS will assess him penalties and interest related to his late filing and the above
refund will be applied to these assessments. He does not believe he will owe any
money for the 2010 tax year.9
Applicant has not filed his state income tax returns for the tax years 2009 and
2010. He recently attempted to obtain the state form to file the tax returns for the tax
years 2009 and 2010, but he was unable to retrieve the forms for these tax years from
the state website. He submitted an electronic request for these forms shortly before the
hearing. Applicant was able to access information about his state tax account, which
covers his taxes for the tax years 2009 through 2013. The documentation shows that he
filed his tax returns in 2011, 2012, and 2013 and that he does not owe any taxes for
these years. The documentation also indicates that he did not file a tax return for the tax
years 2009 and 2010 and that he does not owe any taxes to the state for either year. He
does not owe any past-due taxes to the state.10
Applicant does not owe any past taxes nor does he have any past-due debts. He
is current on his debts and monthly expenses. The IRS and the state have not filed tax
liens against him and have not garnished his wages for past-due taxes. When asked
how the government can be assured that he will timely file his taxes in the future,
Applicant advised that over the last four years, he has learned how to obtain all
necessary information needed to file his tax returns. He explained that one reason for
his delay in complying with his 2009 and 2010 tax filing obligations was his lack of
knowledge on how to resolve this problem once it started.11
Policies
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially
5
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available,
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in
making a decision.
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b)
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based
on the evidence contained in the record.
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an applicant is
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” An
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security
decision.
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of
the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of
classified information.
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set
out in AG & 18:      
6
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
AG ¶ 19 describes the disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns.
I have considered all the conditions, and the following is potentially applicable: 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as
required or the fraudulent filing of the same.
Applicant had not filed his 2009 and 2010 federal and state income tax returns as
of the date of the issuance of the SOR. A security concern has been established under
AG ¶ 19(g).
The Financial Considerations guideline also includes examples of conditions that
can mitigate security concerns. I have considered mitigating factors AG ¶ 20(a) through
¶ 20(f) and find that none of them apply.
Recently, the Appeal Board issued a decision denying an applicant’s security
clearance after the applicant repaid the IRS more than $100,000 through a wage
garnishment for taxes owed over a period of 10 years. In that case, the Appeal Board
stated that “a person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not
demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons
granted access to classified information.” The Appeal Board noted that a person who
has a history of failing to file [emphasis supplied] income tax returns does not
demonstrate a high degree of judgment and reliability required for access to classified
information. See  ISCR No. 12-05043 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014), citing ISCR Case No.
98-0608 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2000).  
In the instant case, Applicant failed to timely  file his federal and state income tax
returns for 2009 and 2010. He filed his 2010 federal tax return two days before his
security clearance hearing. He has yet to file his 2009 federal tax return or his state tax
returns for either year. Although he does not owe any taxes to the federal or state
governments, his failure to file his tax returns even after being granted an extension of
time by the IRS shows poor judgment and a lack of reliability. He has not mitigated the
security concerns under Guideline F.
Guideline E, Personal Conduct
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions
7
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.
AG ¶ 16 describes the disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns.
I have considered all the conditions, and the following is potentially applicable: 
(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any
other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse
determination, but which, when combined with all available information
supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply
with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the
person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes
but is not limited to consideration of:
(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.
Applicant failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for the tax years
2009 and 2010, which constitutes a pattern of failing to follow the rules under AG ¶
16(d) and while that factor would not on its face fully apply because it is adverse
information covered under another Guideline, his conduct implicates the poor judgment
concerns under AG ¶ 15.
The Personal Conduct guideline also includes examples of conditions that can
mitigate security concerns. I have considered mitigating factors AG ¶ 17(a) through ¶
17(g), and the following are potentially applicable:
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.
Applicant is making belated efforts to address his known non-compliance with his
income tax filing obligations for the tax years 2009 and 2010. He has filed his 2010
federal tax return, but not his 2009 return. He is trying to obtain the appropriate
documents for filing his state tax returns for both years. While he has not timely filed his
income tax returns, he does not owe either the IRS or the state any additional money for
taxes in either year. Outside of these two years, Applicant has filed his income tax
returns for more than 30 years. In trying to resolve the problem of lost information for his
2010 taxes, he has learned how to resolve problems related to missing information
needed to file a complete tax return. I have weighed Applicant’s continued
procrastination to fulfill his legal obligation to timely file his income tax returns, his many
years of timely filing his income tax returns, his paid taxes for 2009 and 2010, and his
positive management of his income and expenses. Given the positive steps he has
8
taken, I conclude that AG 17(d) partially applies, but concerns persist as outlined in
Guideline F.
Whole-Person Concept
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant’s
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a He
dsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The decision to grant or
deny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both
favorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the
evidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is
established and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant’s eligibility
for a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,
but on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a
nexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. 
In reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating
conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. For over 30
years Applicant timely filed his federal and state income tax returns. Although the IRS
granted his request for an extension of time to file his 2009 and 2010 federal income tax
returns, he has not filed his 2009 federal tax return and only filed his 2010 federal
income tax return two days before his hearing.  He has not filed his delinquent state tax
returns. While he does not owe federal or state income taxes, his continued failure to
file his 2009 federal tax return and his state tax returns for reasons unknown continues
to raise security concerns under Guidelines E and F. His continued procrastination
towards this important financial legal obligation raises a concern about he will handle
classified information.
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant’s
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude
Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances and personal
conduct under Guidelines F and E.
Applicant filed his federal income tax return, but he has not filed his state income tax return.12

Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a: Against Applicant12
Subparagraph 1.b: Against Applicant
Subparagraph 1.c: Against Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph 2.a: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
