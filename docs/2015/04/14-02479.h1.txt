Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his eligibility for
access to classified information. Applicant presented sufficient evidence of reform to
mitigate the concern raised by his history of drug abuse consisting of the occasional use
of marijuana, including use after being granted a security clearance in 2005.
Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.
Statement of the Case
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86 Format) on March 26, 2013.  After reviewing the application and1
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense
 The SOR was issued by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland. It is a separate2
and distinct organization from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which is part of the Defense Legal
Services Agency, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,3
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992,
as amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The
AG  were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006).

(DOD),  on August 22, 2014, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it2
was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant his
continued eligibility for access to classified information.  The SOR is similar to a3
complaint. It detailed the reasons for the action under the security guideline known as
Guideline H for drug involvement. He answered the SOR in writing on September 12,
2014, he admitted the two allegations involving marijuana use, and he requested a
hearing.         
The case was assigned to another administrative judge on November 6, 2014,
and then reassigned to me on December 15, 2014. The hearing was held as scheduled
on January 27, 2015. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on February 5, 2015. 
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a major defense contractor. He is seeking
to retain a security clearance that was previously granted to him in 2005. His
educational background includes a master’s degree. He is employed as a financial
manager for a particular business unit of the company. He had a summer internship
with the company in 2004, and has been a full-time employee since 2005. His 2014
year-end performance review indicates that he consistently exceeds expectations, and
his manager could not be more pleased with his performance.  4
Applicant has been married for about four years, and he and his spouse are
expecting their first child later this year. His spouse is employed by the same major
defense contractor for the same period of time, and she also works as a financial
manager. Together, their annual gross income is about $200,000. About two years ago
in June 2013, they both accepted promotions to management positions, a decision that
required them to move from the east coast to the west coast.   5
A few months before the move, in March 2013, when Applicant was working as a
contracts representative, he completed a security clearance application in which he

disclosed marijuana use.  He reported the following details about his marijuana use: (1)6
he used marijuana from about September 2001 to January 2013; (2) he described the
nature of his use as rare, taking place mostly in college; (3) he admitted using marijuana
while possessing a security clearance; and (4) he stated that his usage was rare as it
was limited to social or medicinal purposes and it had no effect on his employment.      
Applicant provided additional information about his marijuana use during the
background investigation in May 2013.  He stated that he smoked marijuana once a7
week while in college during 2001–2005. He stated that he smoked marijuana one to
three times per year from 2005 to January 2013. He stated that he smoked marijuana
while attending social events when it was provided by others. He denied ever buying
marijuana. He stated that his last use of marijuana took place in January 2013 at a New
Year’s Eve party.  
At the hearing, Applicant provided additional details about his marijuana use as
follows: (1) he disclosed his marijuana use during 2001–2005 when he applied for a
security clearance in 2005; (2) he explained that he did not use marijuana once a week
during 2001–2005, as that statement was an overestimation; (3) he estimated using
marijuana 20 to 30 times while in college; (4) he explained that he did not use marijuana
one to three times annually during 2005–2013, as that statement was also an
overestimation; (5) he estimated using marijuana five to six times during 2005–2013
while in possession of a security clearance; and (6) his last use of marijuana was in
January 2013.  He realized that he could no longer use marijuana in 2013 or 2014, and8
he decided then that his occasional marijuana use was not worth it, he does not need to
use it, and he does not intend to use marijuana in the future.9
Also at the hearing, Applicant submitted a signed statement of intent not to abuse
any drugs in the future, and he further agreed that any such violation will be grounds for
automatic revocation of his eligibility.  He further stated that since moving to the west10
coast in 2013, he and his wife have changed their lifestyle, he has not used marijuana,
and he no longer associates with drug-using friends and acquaintances on the east
coast.  11
Applicant’s spouse confirmed that her husband’s marijuana use during
2005–2013 was a lapse of judgment, it is not something she supports, and it is not

something she expects to continue.  She explained that they, as a couple, now12
recognize that his post-2005 marijuana use was a bad decision and they would think
differently, or not make the same decision again, in the future.  She has never seen her13
husband use marijuana, and she confirmed that her husband has had no contact with
the people with whom he smoked marijuana.  She also explained that since moving in14
2013 and working in management roles, their lifestyle has changed with a greater
emphasis on work, and they have developed a new small group of friends with whom
they socialize.15
 
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As16
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt17
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An18
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  19
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting20
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An21
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate

facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate22
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  23
In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a
preponderance of the evidence.  The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s24
reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence
standard.25
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it26
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
In analyzing this case, I have paid special attention to Applicant’s credibility.
During the hearing, I had an opportunity to observe his demeanor and evaluate his
sincerity, candor, and truthfulness. Applicant answered questions directly and without
reservation or equivocation, and I found his testimony to be credible. Any
inconsistencies, between his reported marijuana use during his background
investigation in May 2013 and his hearing testimony, were explained by Applicant as
overestimations. His explanation was reasonable, and I have no concern that he is now
understating his marijuana use. Likewise, I found the testimony of Applicant’s spouse to
be credible, and she was an impressive witness. 
Under Guideline H, the concern is that illegal drug use, or misuse of a legal drug,
can raise questions about a person’s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment, because
it may impair a person’s judgment, and because it calls into question a person’s
 AG ¶ 24. Concerning Guideline H, in an October 24, 2014 memorandum, the Director of National27
Intelligence reaffirmed that the disregard of federal law concerning use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana is
relevant in national security determinations regardless of changes to state laws concerning marijuana use.
 Drug abuse, as defined in AG ¶ 24(b), means the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner28
that deviates from approved medical direction.

willingness to follow laws, rules, and regulations.  In analyzing this case, the following27
disqualifying and mitigating conditions are most pertinent:
AG ¶ 25(a) any drug abuse;28
AG ¶ 25(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance;
and 
AG ¶ 26(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future,
such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)
changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an
appropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with
automatic revocation of clearance for any violation. 
Applicant’s history of marijuana use, both while in college and during his
employment years, raises a concern under Guideline H. The undisputed evidence
shows he engaged in drug abuse by the occasional use of marijuana from 2001 to
January 2013, a 12-year-period. His actions were in violation of federal law, and in
violation of his employer’s drug-free workplace policy, as is the regular course of
business for a large company doing business with the Defense Department. And what’s
more, his occasional marijuana use, estimated at five to six times, during 2005–2013
took place while Applicant was in possession of a security clearance. Applicant knew or
should have known that even occasional marijuana use was taboo and off-limits. 
Nevertheless, I am satisfied that Applicant now fully understands and appreciates
the gravity of his misconduct. I am also satisfied that he presented sufficient evidence of
reform based on (1) his two-year period of abstinence based on his last marijuana use
in January 2013, (2) his disassociation from his drug-using friends and acquaintances
on the east coast, and (3) his signed statement of intent not to engage in drug abuse in
the future. In addition, his promotion to a management role as well as being an
expectant first-time parent show that he is progressing from a young adult in his 20s to
a more mature and responsible adult. Finally, his spouse’s knowledge of his past
marijuana use, her participation in the hearing, and her support of her husband gives
me confidence that Applicant will continue to remain drug free. For all these reasons, I
am persuaded and convinced that Applicant’s history of occasional marijuana use is
safely in the past and will not recur.

In addition to the mitigating conditions under Guideline H, I have considered
several additional factors.  First, Applicant receives credit in mitigation because he29
voluntarily reported the information about his marijuana use on both his 2005 and 2013
security clearance applications and during background investigations. Second, he
receives credit because he was truthful and complete in responding to questions about
his marijuana use. And third, he receives credit because he demonstrated positive
changes in behavior based on his two-year-period of abstinence from marijuana use
and his disassociation from drug-using friends or associates. Although his marijuana
use after being granted a security clearance was grievously poor judgment, he has
done the things expected of a person who is currently eligible for access to classified
information.
Applicant met his burden to present sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate
the drug involvement security concern stemming from his occasional marijuana use. I
have no doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. In reaching
this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable
evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due
consideration to the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I conclude that he has met30
his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline H: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
