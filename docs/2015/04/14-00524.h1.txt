Decision

MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant had ongoing financial difficulties following a July 2007 bankruptcy 
discharge. As of October 2014, he was delinquent on a credit card account, on his 
mortgage, and on his student loan. He satisfied his credit card debt and brought his home 
loan current with pension funds. Yet, his history of late payments on his home loan and his 
inconsistent payments on his federal student loan debt continue to cast doubt about his 
financial judgment. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On October 9, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security 
concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and explaining why it was unable to 
find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance 
eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
 
 
 2 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations on October 16, 2014. He requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA). On December 11, 2014, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to 
determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. On December 17, 2014, I issued a Notice of Hearing 
scheduling the hearing for January 14, 2015. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. The Government submitted four exhibits (GEs 
1-4) and the Applicant submitted five exhibits (AEs A-E), all of which were admitted without 
any objections. A chart, which was prepared by Department Counsel as a supplement to 
his oral closing argument, was marked as a hearing exhibit, but not accepted as a formal 
exhibit in the record. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on 
January 26, 2015. 
 
At Applicant’s request, I held the record open for two weeks after the hearing for him 
to submit additional documentary evidence. On January 24, 2015, Applicant forwarded five 
documents, which on receipt on January 29, 2015, were marked as AEs F-J. Department 
Counsel filed no objections by the February 10, 2015 deadline for comment, so the record 
closed on February 10, 2015. Applicant’s submissions were marked and received as AEs 
F-J. 
 
Summary of SOR Allegations 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
around April 2007, which was discharged in July 2007 (SOR 1.a). Additionally, as of 
October 9, 2014, Applicant was 120 days or more behind on a credit card with a $3,697 
balance (SOR 1.b); on his mortgage of $152,939 ($11,859 past due) (SOR 1.c); and on his 
$44,694 in student loan debt (SOR 1.d). In his Answer to the SOR allegations, Applicant 
admitted the bankruptcy filing, which he attributed to his then part-time employment. 
Applicant admitted that he was behind on the credit card, mortgage, and student loan 
accounts. However, the credit card debt was $2,116 and only 30 days past due. His 
mortgage was behind 90 days for $5,294. His student loan account was 30 days past due. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following 
findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 42-year-old high school graduate (Tr. 19-20), who has worked for his 
defense contractor employer as an outside electrician since March 2014. (Tr. 22.) He 
served in a branch of the National Guard from October 1989 to January 2000, when he 
was granted an honorable discharge at the rank of corporal (E-4). (AE E; Tr. 24.) He held a 
secret-level security clearance for his Guard duties. (GE 1; AE E.) 
 
 3 
 
Applicant and his spouse married in August 2000. Applicant’s spouse has two 
daughters, born in April 1992 and November 1994 during her first marriage, who were 
raised by Applicant and his spouse. (GE 1; Tr. 23.) Applicant’s spouse received child 
support sporadically from her ex-husband. (Tr. 66.) 
 
Applicant attended a technical school for training as an electrical technician from 
1992 to 1994. (Tr. 49.) He took out federal student loans totaling around $44,000 (SOR 
1.d). (GE 3; Tr. 49.) The available record contains no information about the nature of 
Applicant’s employment until February 2003, when he was hired as a communications 
technician. Following a job layoff in October 2003 (Tr. 26), he was unemployed until April 
2005, when he began working, initially part time, as a courier for a package delivery 
company. In November 2005, Applicant became a full-time employee. (Tr. 27.) 
 
Applicant had relied heavily on consumer credit debt to purchase necessities for 
himself and his family when he was unemployed from October 2003 to April 2005. (Tr. 26.) 
With creditors threatening to garnish his wages, in mid-April 2007, he filed a no-asset 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, apparently listing approximately $12,000 in delinquent debt.
1
 
In July 2007, he was granted a bankruptcy discharge. (GEs 1, 2, 4; Tr. 37-38.) 
 
Applicant was extended credit after his bankruptcy. Between November 2007 and 
June 2009, he opened four revolving charge accounts, including the credit card account in 
SOR 1.b in November 2007. In June 2009, Applicant and his spouse bought their home, 
taking on a mortgage of $161,792 (SOR 1.c). (GE 3.) 
 
In late 2010, Applicant’s employer began reducing his work hours because of 
overstaffing. He made only one payment on his student loan in 2011 before requesting a 
deferment in September 2011, because of reduced income. (AE J; Tr. 49.) 
 
In May 2011, Applicant and his spouse started paying their mortgage late. Their 
mortgage payment of $1,340.66 on August 2, 2011, was returned for insufficient funds. 
(GE 3; AE G.) In October 2011, they were assigned a home loan adviser (customer 
relationship manager). (AE F.) Applicant and his spouse continued to make mortgage 
payments, but not in amounts sufficient to bring their loan current. After a $1,265.77 
payment in December 2011, they were $3,951.16 delinquent. In April 2012 and again in 
July 2012, Applicant and his spouse were assigned new customer relationship managers. 
They had to resubmit their paperwork for a modification each time. On August 3, 2012, 
their request for a loan modification was denied because their lender concluded they did 
not have the resources to support a repayment plan or loan modification. Applicant 
continued to pursue a possible modification with the lender. (AE G.) In December 2012, 
Applicant and his spouse were informed that their home loan had been sold. The balance 
on their home loan was $172,847.72. (AE H.) They were nine months behind in their 
payments with no progress toward a modification. The new loan servicer wanted a $25,000 
                                                 
1
The bankruptcy schedules were not submitted in evidence. Applicant indicated on his e-QIP (GE 1) that 
$12,000 was the total amount involved in the bankruptcy. 
 
 
 4 
lump-sum payment. His spouse’s mother gave them $25,000 as a gift, which they paid on 
the mortgage to avert foreclosure. (AE F; Tr. 36-41.)  
 
In August 2012, Applicant was terminated from his job with the package delivery 
company after he backed a company truck into a parked vehicle. He was deemed an 
unsafe employee. (Tr. 21.) Applicant collected unemployment benefits until November 
2012, when he was hired to refit service vans for an electric company. (GE 1; Tr. 22.) 
Applicant was paid $12 an hour, which was a decrease from his $18 hourly wage at the 
package delivery company. (Tr. 28-29.) 
 
Applicant made sporadic payments on his student loans. After $252.51 payments in 
August 2002 and September 2002, he paid nothing until 2007, when he paid $300 in 
March 2007 and $303.78 in November 2007. He paid $296.53 in January 2008 and $600 
in February 2008, but then nothing until April 2009. Between April 2009 and December 
2010, he made 13 payments totaling $7,002. Three times, he made payments exceeding 
$1,000 in an attempt to catch up on his student loan payment. He paid another $337 
toward his student loans before consolidating them for $47,885.26 in September 2011. 
(GEs 3, 4; AE J.) He obtained a hardship deferment until August 2012, but he then could 
not make the payments. (Tr. 49-50.) Applicant testified that after he started with the 
trucking company in November 2012, he contacted the lender holding his student loans 
and filed for an income based-repayment amount because of his reduced income. 
Applicant testified that around February 2013, his application for the lower payment was 
approved. (Tr. 51.) 
 
In February 2013, Applicant and his spouse applied for a “Government Trial” 
program through their home loan servicer to address their mortgage. (AE H; Tr. 30.) In May 
2013, they stopped paying their mortgage. (GE 3; AE I.) In June 2013, they were assigned 
a contact person to assist them with options for making their home loan affordable. 
Between November 2013 and February 2014, Applicant and his spouse submitted 
documents at the request of their loan servicer (i.e., income information; request for 
modification; hardship affidavit; and letter of benefits statement). (AE H.) As of January 
2014, their home loan was $11,859 past due. (GE 3.)  
 
In March 2014, Applicant began working for his current employer at an hourly wage 
of approximately $18. (Tr. 22.) On March 5, 2014, Applicant completed and certified to the 
accuracy of an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). In response 
to the financial record inquiries, Applicant disclosed his Chapter 7 discharge in 2007 of 
$12,000 in debt and a delinquency of $552 on the credit card account identified in SOR 
1.b. (GE 1.) 
 
A check of Applicant’s credit on March 19, 2014, showed that the credit card 
account in SOR 1.b was $414 past due on a balance of $3,697. Applicant’s and his 
spouse’s mortgage was reportedly $11,859 past due. Applicant’s student loan (SOR 1.d) 
was reported as having a deferred balance of $50,286 as of February 2014. Applicant was 
making timely payments on $2,282 in aggregate debt on four revolving charge accounts. 
(GE 3.) 
 
 5 
Applicant made payments when he could afford to do so on the credit card debt in 
SOR 1.b. (AE A; Tr. 32-33.) Applicant and his spouse paid $1,242.24 toward their 
mortgage in May 2014 (AE I), but they did not make a mortgage payment in June 2014 or 
from August 2014 through October 2014. (AEs H, I.) When asked why he had not made his 
student loan payments, Applicant responded, “That’s when my car actually went kaput. It 
was tough to get to work every week.” (Tr. 67.) 
 
Around October 2014, Applicant learned that he had a vested pension of $21,000 
from his work with the package delivery company. He elected to pay a 20% penalty for 
early withdrawal and cash out the pension. With the $17,040 in pension funds he received 
in November 2014, Applicant and his spouse paid $6,162.99 in November 2014 toward 
their mortgage.
2
 As of their $1,281.11 payment on January 23, 2015, their mortgage loan 
was current with a $160,747.70 balance. (AE I.)  
 
With his pension funds, Applicant also paid $2,116.64 in November 2014 to satisfy 
in full his credit card debt in SOR 1.b, and that account was closed. Additionally, he 
testified that he paid $790 in car repairs (new brakes and tires) for his spouse’s vehicle and 
$430 for repairs to his car. (GE 4; AEs A; Tr. 31-35, 57, 74.) Yet, a budget prepared by 
Applicant in January 2015 shows a $163 monthly payment toward a personal loan. (AE B.) 
He opened an unsecured loan for $4,200 in August 2014, to repair the engine on his 
vehicle so that he could get to work. (GE 4; Tr. 47, 71.) The loan balance was $4,183 as of 
November 2014. (GE 4.) Some of the pension monies went to repay personal loans, of 
$2,500 from his brother-in-law when he was unemployed, and of $200 from his mother-in-
law for food. (Tr. 57.) He also paid off a $700 debt for fitness equipment,
3
 a credit card debt 
of $650, and $1,500 in veterinary costs. Applicant also bought a new refrigerator. (Tr. 57-
58.) 
 
Available documentary evidence about his student loans show that Applicant made 
no student loan payments after July 2011 until August 2014, when he paid $144.24.

 He

Applicant testified that he paid $5,500 on his mortgage in November 2014 to bring his loan current as of 
December 2014. (Tr. 35.) He presented as evidence authorization for a payment of $5,294.83 on November 1, 
2014. Transaction records on the mortgage account discrepantly show payments totaling $4,881.88 on 
November 4, 2014, and of $1,281.11 on November 14, 2014. (AE I.) 
 
3 
Available credit reports (GEs 3, 4) show that Applicant opened a credit card account with a $1,700 credit limit 
for the purchase of the fitness equipment in July 2009.  
 
4 
Applicant’s testimony leaves the impression that he made more payments in the last year or so than the 
transaction history shows: 
 
A. I filed for what was called income-based repayment because of the reduction [in his 
income]. Once that was approved, I started paying the full amount.  
Q. The full reduced amount? 
A. The reduced amount, yes. 
Q. Okay. And you started that when? 
A. That was in—I believe that payment started February of 2013. 
Q. Okay, so a few months after you’d been at [the trucking company]? 
A. Correct. 
Q. And February 2013 you started paying how much approximately? 
 
 6 
paid $216.36 to catch up for September, October, and November in early November 2014 
(AEs D, J; Tr. 61), but he then did not make his $72.12 payment in December 2014. (AE 
D.) When asked why he fell behind in his student loan payments in the fall of 2014, 
Applicant explained that his car had mechanical problems, and he had to get a ride to work 
from a friend. He gave his friend $40 for gasoline. (Tr. 67.) Additionally, his employer had a 
10-day shutdown over the holidays in 2014, and Applicant was paid for only six days. He 
had only three floating holidays left. (Tr. 68-69.) 
 
 In December 2014, Applicant cosigned on a credit card account with a $400 credit 
limit for one of his stepdaughters. The account had a $400 balance. He also opened a 
revolving charge account with a jewelry store that had an $823 balance.
5
 He bought a 
diamond ring for his spouse at her request. (Tr. 71.) Applicant did not think that he was 
going to be granted credit, and he could not deny his wife. (Tr. 72.) Applicant was making 
timely payments on his credit card account with a home improvement retailer, which had a 
$101 balance, and on a bank credit card with a $626 balance. He was not behind on any 
consumer charge accounts. (GE 4.) Applicant made a “New Year’s resolution” to start 
standing up for himself when he comes to future purchases that may strain the family’s 
budget. (Tr. 72.) 
 
Applicant’s hourly wage for his work with the defense contractor was $18.68 as of 
mid-January 2015, to increase by $.75 at the end of his first year on the job. (Tr. 22.) He 
works six hours of overtime every other week. (Tr. 48.) Applicant’s spouse works about 20 
hours a week at a daycare center at $9 an hour. (Tr. 24, 64.) For the previous five years, 
she was paid $8.50 an hour. (Tr. 64.) Applicant has handled the family’s finances since 
they married. (Tr. 54.) His spouse cashes her check and gives him $120 for the household 
expenses. He asked her for some extra money in December 2014 to pay his student loan. 
She declined, even though Applicant told her that it could cost him his security clearance. 
(Tr. 71.)  
 
                                                                                                                                                             
A. It was about $75.  
Q. Okay. And have you been paying that nonstop since 2013? 
A. To the best of my ability, yes. 
Q. Okay, have there been months you’ve missed it? 
A. I missed last month and that was it. 
Q. Okay. So although it says it’s been delinquent since 2011, it’s your testimony that you 
missed a few months in 2011, and you’ve missed a few months here and there since 2012? 
A. That’s correct. 
Q. I have documentation right here saying that it’s past due one month. 
 
(Tr. 51-52.) 
 
5 
Applicant’s credit report of January 2015 shows four credit card accounts with balances. (GE 4.) He testified 
that he has only two credit card accounts (Tr. 61), and he has budgeted for payments on only two accounts 
(the new jewelry debt and his bank credit card from September 2008). (AE B.) Apparently, the $400 credit card 
was cosigned by Applicant for one of his stepdaughters so that she could repair her vehicle. (Tr. 73.) The 
home improvement revolving charge on his record was opened in June 2009 (GEs 3, 4), but he may well have 
paid off the $101 balance.  
 
 
 7 
Applicant’s two adult stepdaughters were still living at home as of January 2015. 
Both stepdaughters were employed. One of them was attending school while holding a job. 
(Tr. 23-24.) The younger stepdaughter pays her portion of the cell phone bill. The older 
daughter pays $25 a week for room and board. (Tr. 65.) Applicant has been setting aside 
their contributions to the household for when they leave home rather than using the funds 
to pay household expenses. (Tr. 66.)  
 
 Applicant prepared a budget in mid-January 2015, which shows net discretionary 
income of $205 per month after their $1,281 mortgage payment; $25 toward his bank credit 
card debt; $103 in electric utility costs; $163 toward the personal loan to repair his car; 
$190 in bundled cable/Internet/telephone costs; $220 for four cell phones; $72 toward his 
student loan debt; $30 toward the new jewelry debt; $60 in gasoline; $75 for car insurance; 
and $550 for groceries. (AE B; Tr. 47-48.) Applicant and his spouse have taken some 
steps to reduce their monthly expenses by going out only once a month, cancelling some 
movie and computer monthly subscription services, and changing homeowner and 
automobile insurance carriers. (Tr. 54-55.) Applicant set aside $250 in a savings account to 
cover his tax debt for early withdrawal of his pension funds. (Tr. 56.) Applicant borrowed 
$500 from his 401(k) for groceries. Payments are being made automatically from his 
wages. (Tr. 58-59.) 
 
 Applicant received a federal income tax refund of $1,000 and a state income tax 
refund of $290 for tax year 2013. He gave the state income tax money to his spouse. He 
used his federal income tax refund for windows for their home. (Tr. 56-57.)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
 
 8 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern about financial considerations is articulated in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 Applicant was afforded a financial fresh start through a bankruptcy discharge in 
June 2007 (SOR 1.a). Between November 2007 and June 2009, he opened four revolving 
charge accounts, including a $1,700 debt for exercise equipment in July 2009. While he 
made timely payments to reduce that debt to $779 as of February 2014, he fell behind 
more than 120 days on another revolving charge account (SOR 1.b). He made no 
payments on his mortgage (SOR 1.c) from April 2013 until May 2014, or on his student 
loan (SOR 1.d) from August 2011 until August 2014. He obtained a hardship deferment of 
his student loan for part of that time, but then could not make the payments when it was no 
longer deferred. Two disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 19 apply because of Applicant’s 
record of delinquent accounts: 
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 9 
Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current, reliability, or good judgment,” does not apply to recent 
delinquency. As of March 2014, Applicant was behind $414 in his payments on the credit 
card account in SOR 1.b and $11,859 on his mortgage (SOR 1.c). He testified that his 
student loan was no longer deferred as of August 2012, and he made no payments for the 
next 18 months, although there is no indication that his student loan was considered to be 
in default while he was being considered for an income-based repayment program.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) applies in that unemployment or low income were significant causes for 
Applicant’s bankruptcy and subsequent financial difficulties: 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
 
Applicant relied heavily on consumer credit to pay for necessities during a lengthy 
unemployment from October 2003 to April 2005. After approximately $12,000 in debt was 
discharged in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy, he and his spouse bought their home in June 
2009. A reduction in his work hours around late 2010 led him to stop paying his student 
loan, with the exception of one $337 payment in July 2011. After he lost his job as a courier 
for the package delivery company in August 2012, he worked for the trucking company 
from November 2012 to March 2014. However, he was paid only $12 an hour when he had 
been earning $18 with the package delivery company. At the same time, Applicant did not 
act responsibly when he charged $832 for a diamond ring for his spouse and then did not 
make his student loan payment in December 2014. 
 
With his income from his defense contractor employment, Applicant paid down the 
debt on the credit card debt in SOR 1.b to $2,116.64, before paying it off in early 
November 2014 with pension funds. Applicant and his spouse pursued modification of their 
home loan for almost two years before their current debt servicer approved their request in 
March 2014. He obtained a hardship deferment and then an income-based repayment plan 
for his student loan debt. These efforts to address his debts implicate AG ¶ 20(c) and AG ¶ 
20(d): 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control, and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
At the same time, Applicant managed to catch up on his mortgage only because of 
the pension asset. He did not make any mortgage payments or student loan payments in 
September 2014 and October 2014. It is unclear what he did with the income that should 
 
 10 
have gone to the mortgage. He explained that he had car trouble. Yet, he took on the 
$4,200 loan in August 2014 to cover those costs. Applicant’s financial difficulties in 
December 2014 appear to be related to a lower paycheck due to his employer’s 10-day 
shutdown over the holidays, but Applicant also gave priority to holiday purchases over his 
federal student loan payment. When he asked his spouse for some extra funds to make his 
payment, she was uncooperative. Applicant estimated that he has $205 remaining after 
paying the household’s monthly expenses and his debt payments. However, the recent 
delinquency on his mortgage and student loan debts suggests a tight financial situation. 
Applicant does not have a history of recent payments on his student loan debt. Based on 
the record, it would be premature to apply either AG ¶ 20(c) or AG ¶ 20(d) to his mortgage 
or student loan debts. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and 
all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative 
process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at 
the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) 
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
  
The financial analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. 
Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant 
additional comment. 
 
Applicant clearly could not afford to meet all his financial obligations when he was 
earning only $12 an hour with the trucking company. His present wage of $18.68 an hour 
has stabilized his family’s finances somewhat, although he has yet to demonstrate a 
sustained record of regular payments on his student loan. The salient issue is whether he 
has exercised sound financial judgment within his limited means to ensure that he can be 
counted on to abide by the rules and regulations concerning the handling of classified 
information. 
 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases, stating: 
 
[A]n applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid 
off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his 
 
 11 
financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The 
Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s 
plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and 
realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered 
in reaching a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan 
(and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at 
a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation marks 
omitted). When Applicant realized that he could not make his payments, he took responsible 
steps to obtain a loan modification and to defer his student loans. As of March 2014, the 
financial stress of delinquency on his and his spouse’s home loan was alleviated by their 
mortgage servicer’s adding the delinquency to the end of the loan. Applicant was approved for 
an income-based repayment of his student loan under which he is to make $72.12 monthly 
payments as opposed to his previous $337. Yet, Applicant was not able or not willing to comply 
with the promised payments on either loan in September and October 2014. Car trouble does 
not adequately explain his delinquency, given he had taken out a $4,200 loan to repair his car. 
He testified that he had a hard time getting to work. He has the burden of demonstrating that he 
acted responsibly or that there were mitigating or extenuating circumstances that caused him to 
fall behind more than $5,000 in his mortgage payments, and his evidence falls short in this 
regard. 
 
 Applicant has a history of catch-up payments on his financial accounts, and his creditors 
are accepting late payments on his accounts as of December 2014. Yet, some concerns persist 
about Applicant’s financial judgment. He testified that he has been making his student loan 
payments, for the most part, since February 2013. Student loan payment records show only two 
payments by him since July 2011, and they were made in August 2014 and in November 2014. 
He apparently had nothing left from the $17,040 in pension funds received in November 2014 to 
make his $72.12 student loan payment in December 2014. He acknowledges that he perhaps 
should have told his spouse that he could not afford to buy her jewelry. A New Year’s resolution 
to start standing up for himself is a promise of change going forward and not a substitute for a 
record of timely payments. Perhaps at some future date, Applicant may be able to show, by a 
record of timely payments on his mortgage and student loan debts, that he possesses the sound 
judgment that must be demanded of persons granted security clearance eligibility. After 
considering all the evidence of record, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information at this time. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
 
 12 
Subparagraph 1.a:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
