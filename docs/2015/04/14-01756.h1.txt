MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant and his spouse filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in March 2003 to 
resolve approximately $40,000 in medical debt, her student loan debt, and some past-due 
credit card balances. In November 2011, they lost their previous residence through a 
foreclosure sale. They have continued to struggle financially, in part, because of her 
unemployment and their decision to keep their children in private schools. They owe 
approximately $14,000 in delinquent property taxes for 2011 and 2012 on their current 
home. Applicant did not show a sufficient record of repayment that could have alleviated the 
financial security concerns. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On July 28, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security 
concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and explaining why it was unable to 
find it clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his security clearance 
eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
 
 
 2 
Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations on August 26, 2014.
1
 He requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA). On October 2, 2014, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to 
determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. On October 21, 2014, I issued a Notice of Hearing 
scheduling the hearing for November 21, 2014. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. The Government submitted three exhibits 
(GEs 1-3), which were entered into evidence. Applicant expressed concerns about the 
source of some of the information revealed during his background investigation, but he did 
not object to GE 3, which contained an investigator’s summary of his subject interview. 
Applicant submitted seven exhibits (AEs A-G), which were admitted without any objections. 
On the Government’s motion, the SOR was amended at the hearing to conform to the 
evidence presented. Applicant and his spouse testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) 
received on December 4, 2014. 
 
At Applicant’s request, I held the record open for two weeks after the hearing for him 
to submit additional documentary evidence. No documents were received. 
 
Rulings on Procedure 
 
 At the close of the hearing testimony, the Government moved under paragraph 
E3.1.17 of the Directive to amend the SOR and add a new allegation, as follows: 
 
1.d. You are indebted to the town of [town name and state omitted] for 
property taxes in the approximate amount of $14,000. 
 
 Applicant filed no objection to the proposed amendment. I granted the 
Government’s motion, but also held the record open for two weeks after the hearing for 
Applicant to submit evidence of efforts to pay the debt. No documents were received. 
 
Summary of SOR Allegations 
 
 The amended SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant owed $2,000 in past-
due state income taxes as of July 28, 2014 (SOR 1.a); that he failed to file his state income 
tax returns for tax years 2005 through 2008 when legally required to do so (SOR 1.b); that 
he filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2003, which was dismissed in June 2003; and 
that he owes around $14,000 in local property taxes (SOR 1.d). When he answered the 
SOR allegations in August 2014, Applicant denied the state tax debt and the alleged 
noncompliance with his state tax filing obligations. He asserted that he owed a tax debt of

only $79, which he paid in May 2014. Applicant admitted that he had filed for bankruptcy as 
alleged. At the time, he had two small children, and his spouse was a full-time college 
student. At his November 2014 security clearance hearing, Applicant’s only comment about 
the property tax debt in SOR 1.d was that he had no knowledge about the debt as of his 
subject interview. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following 
findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 59-year-old electrical installation mechanic, who has worked for his 
employer, a defense contractor, since November 1975. (GEs 1-3; Tr. 26-27.) He seeks to 
retain a secret-level security clearance, which was granted in January 2004. (GEs 1, 3.) 
 
Applicant and his spouse married in June 1996. They have two sons, who are now 
14 and 16. (GEs 1, 2; Tr. 27-28.) His spouse has three adult children, ages 29, 31, and 33, 
from a previous marriage. (GEs 2, 3.) In March 1998, Applicant bought his family’s first 
home, taking on a mortgage debt of $92,500. (GEs 1, 3.) 
 
In March 2003, Applicant and his spouse filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The SOR 
alleges that it was dismissed in June 2003. Applicant’s and his spouse’s accounts about 
the bankruptcy are not completely consistent and in some aspects, are controverted by the 
bankruptcy schedules.
2
 About his reason for filing, Applicant testified that he received a 
letter directing him to send his mortgage payments to a mortgage company in another 
state. Lacking confirmation from his initial lender about the sale or transfer of his mortgage, 
Applicant continued to make his payments to his initial mortgagor. Before long, he received 
a foreclosure letter from the new mortgage holder. He hired an attorney who handled the 
issue for him. Applicant told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator in 
January 2014 that his delinquent home loan was “rectified in terms of back payments.” (GE 
3.) When asked for further clarification about the bankruptcy, Applicant testified that there 
were a couple of credit card accounts that were past due, and that at least one credit card 
account was retained and paid, so it was a partial dismissal. (Tr. 61.) He denies any recall 
of the details of the bankruptcy, including the amount of unsecured debt. (Tr. 67.) 
 
Applicant’s spouse testified that they “probably owed less than $10,000 when they 
filed for bankruptcy, so in retrospect, it was a poor decision to file for bankruptcy.” She later 
admitted on cross-examination that she had forgotten about a $40,000 medical debt 
included in the bankruptcy, which was for her older daughter’s care, and “probably the 
reason” for the bankruptcy filing. (Tr. 78-79.) She also acknowledged that her student loan 
debt was included in the bankruptcy. (Tr. 79.) According to Applicant’s spouse, their debts 
were discharged, including the mortgage on their home. They did not reaffirm the debt but 
retained ownership and continued to pay the mortgage. (Tr. 71, 76.) As for the loan 
                                                 
2 
In questioning Applicant’s spouse, the Government referred to some bankruptcy records, which were not 
submitted in evidence. Apparently, the bankruptcy included the mortgage, two credit card debts, $36,000 in 
student loans, and a $40,000 medical bill. (Tr. 78.)  
 
 4 
involved in their misdirected payments, Applicant’s spouse testified that it was a small, 
“semi-predatory” loan of $8,000 that was sold several times. They hired a lawyer and 
settled the debt. (Tr. 76-77.) 
 
Applicant and his family stayed in their home following the bankruptcy filing. 
According to his e-QIP, they moved to their current residence in October 2005. (GE 1.) 
Applicant purchased the house with savings accumulated from living with his parents until 
he was 38 years old. (GE 1, 3: Tr. 59-61.) Applicant’s spouse testified discrepantly that 
they stayed in the home until approximately 2008 when they needed a bigger home so that 
Applicant’s father could move in with them. (Tr. 71.) Around that time, their home was 
flooded, and they did not qualify for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA). (Tr. 60, 72.) The property was uninhabitable due to mold issues, and they 
did not have $30,000-$40,000 to restore it. Applicant stopped paying the mortgage, and 
the property was sold at a foreclosure auction in November 2011. (GE 3.) 
 
Applicant’s father resided with them from 2008 until his death in 2012. (Tr. 79-80.) 
Applicant’s spouse handled their household bills, and until it was flooded, the bills for their 
previous residence. She knew that some bills for that home, such as the electric bill, went 
unpaid after they abandoned the property. She took over handling bills for her father-in-
law’s house, and with some difficulty, found placement in assisted living for Applicant’s 
disabled brother. Applicant’s spouse earned wages of only $11,982.23 in 2008. She left 
her job of 10 years as a hospital nurse to care for her father-in-law. Applicant and his 
spouse’s adjusted gross income for 2008 was $62,576, down from $96,378 in 2007. (AEs 
F, G.) Applicant’s spouse had some credit card debts of her own that went unpaid. (Tr. 72-
73, 77.) They had some savings, and she cashed in her retirement account of 
approximately $12,000 to pay bills. (Tr. 99.)  
 
Applicant and his spouse have no financial or legal obligation for his disabled 
brother. Applicant’s brother was on the deed to his father’s property. When Applicant’s 
brother could not be convinced to sell the house, a guardian ad litem was appointed, and 
Applicant’s brother was eventually placed in a state facility. (Tr. 94-95.)  
 
On October 31, 2013, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) to renew his security 
clearance eligibility. In response to a financial record inquiry concerning failure to file or pay 
federal state or other taxes when required by law or ordinance, Applicant indicated that he 
failed to file federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2008, and that he owed 
$2,000. Applicant disclosed no other financial difficulties or delinquencies. (GE 1.) 
 
On January 2, 2014, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the 
OPM. Applicant reported holding a secret clearance since January 2004 with no security-
related issues. About his financial issues, Applicant admitted to the investigator that he had 
not filed his state income tax returns for tax years 2005 through 2008 totaling about 
$2,000. His spouse handled the taxes and failed to file returns for those years. Applicant 
expressed no knowledge about why the returns were not filed. He added that the state 
notified him and his spouse in 2012 about their delinquent tax liability, and that he was in 
 
 5 
negotiations with the state’s tax authority to make payments and waive any penalties and 
interest. He indicated that he could afford to pay the tax arrearage and attributed the failure 
to file timely returns to his spouse’s oversight. Applicant denied any other financial issues 
apart from missing one car payment in 2004 or 2005. When confronted about some 
delinquent accounts (i.e., charged-off credit card debts of $1,580, $529, and $582 and a 
$257 collection debt), Applicant explained they were his spouse’s debts. A $1,364 past-due 
utility debt on his record was for services to his previous residence when he and his family 
had already moved, but he still owned the residence. He acknowledged that the 
delinquencies were caused by poor financial management. He expressed intent to pay the 
debts. (GE 3.) 
 
On June 24, 2014, Applicant affirmed that the investigator accurately reported the 
information Applicant provided during his January 2014 interview. (GE 3.) An SOR was 
issued to Applicant, in part, because of his reported failure to file his state income tax 
returns for tax years 2005 through 2008 on time and because of the reported $2,000 tax 
debt. In his Answer to the SOR and at his security clearance hearing, Applicant 
discrepantly asserted that his spouse had paid a $79 state tax debt for 2007, but that he 
and his spouse otherwise received tax refunds. He questioned the source of the 
information about not filing timely returns for 2005 through 2008 and about owing $2,000 in 
state income taxes, even though he had listed the $2,000 tax debt on his e-QIP, admitted 
the tax issues during his subject interview in January 2014, and told the investigator that he 
had been notified of the tax debts by the state in 2012. He speculated that his spouse 
might have listed the information on his e-QIP. Yet, he discrepantly testified that when he 
confronted his spouse about the tax issues after his interview, she denied any knowledge 
of the tax issues. (Tr. 30-38.) 
 
Applicant’s spouse testified to her knowledge that all their  state income tax returns 
had been filed by 2013 (Tr. 112), and that when the DOD raised the issue about not filing 
state tax returns for 2005 through 2008, she went to the state tax authority and was told 
that nothing was owed. When she went to renew her nursing license in May 2014, she had 
to pay a $79.09 state income tax debt for one year when they underpaid their state taxes. 
(AE B.) They paid $733 with their return but owed $79, likely due to “a mistake 
somewhere.” (Tr. 73-74, 81, 84, 106-107.) She learned about the $79 debt around 
February 2014. (Tr. 81.) She denied that they ever owed $2,000 in delinquent state income 
taxes. (Tr. 91.) Copies of their state income tax returns for tax years 2005, 2007, and 2008 
were submitted in evidence only to confirm that they were entitled to refunds for particular 
years, and not for their filing dates. Their 2005 state income tax return, dated February 18, 
2006, shows they overpaid their state tax liability by $678. (AE E.) Their 2007 state income 
tax return is undated and shows an underpayment of $733.
3
 (AE F.) Their 2008 state 
income tax return is dated February 18, 2009, and it shows that they overpaid their state 
income taxes by $455. (AE G.) Applicant did not sign the copies until November 20, 2014. 
Applicant’s spouse signed and dated them as she prepared them. (Tr. 128-131.) She 
maintains that they were filed, albeit “possibly late.” (Tr. 86-88.) Available evidence does 
not corroborate if or when they were filed. However, as of May 2014 (AE A) and August 
                                                 
3 
Their 2007 return shows taxes withheld of $2,473 on a tax liability of $3,206, which would leave them with a 
tax debt of $733 and not the $744 reported.(AE F.) 
 
 6 
2014 (AE C), Applicant and his spouse were considered in good standing with the state’s 
division of taxation. 
 
Applicant’s spouse speculated that the tax debt listed on Applicant’s e-QIP could 
have been for property taxes because they owed $14,000 in past-due property taxes.
4
 
However, she also testified that the property tax debt is for 2011 and 2012 and not for any 
years from 2005 to 2008. (Tr. 108-112.) In June 2014, Applicant and his spouse took out a 
loan with the state to repay their past-due property taxes. They have paid at most $500 on 
the loan. The loan was available to them because she was caring for her father-in-law and 
unemployed. They have six years to pay off the loan before a lien will be placed on their 
property. (Tr. 118-119.) Applicant had testified before his spouse, and he had indicated 
that he was “pretty sure” they were current on their property taxes, although his spouse 
would know about them. (Tr. 53.) She testified that she had “told him all along that there 
was a possibility [they] would take out this loan” to pay their property taxes. (Tr. 112.) By 
2012, she had discussed with Applicant that she had not paid their property taxes. (Tr. 
115.) As of November 2014, she was saving money to pay their 2013 property taxes. (Tr. 
118.) 
 
Applicant’s annual performance evaluations for  his work from October 2008 through 
October 2014 show that he has met all his employer’s expectations. His hourly wage 
increased incrementally from $24.51 in October 2009. His hourly wage for the past year 
was $28.11. (AEs D.) Applicant works as much overtime as he can, averaging eight hours 
of overtime per week. His spouse is a registered nurse, but she is not presently employed. 
(Tr. 54.) Applicant owns their home outright. (Tr. 53.) He and his spouse have only one 
                                                 
4 
Applicant’s spouse testified about their property tax debts, as follows: 
 
A: In other words, we didn’t just not pay them. It was a decision. 
Q: Okay, And at any point in 2011, 2012, or 2013, did you make any payments on those 
[town name omitted] property taxes? 
A: No. 
Q: Any partial payments? 
A: No. 
Q: Okay. 
A: Because typically you pay them in a lump payment anyway. 
Q: Sure. What about 2013’s taxes—what’s the state of those? 
A: We’re in the process of paying them. Like we pay—it’s not an issue until the end of the 
year when they’re due, but I am saving money up to make sure that we pay them. 
Q: Okay. But I’m saying 2013—so this is 2014 now. So have you paid for last year too? 
A: Well, 2013 is paid up until through—yes, I have money saved to pay the taxes. I have not 
paid them as of yet. 
Q: Okay. So in June of 2014, you came to an agreement for a loan for approximately $14,000 
to cover those 2011 and 2012 property taxes. Is that correct? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Okay. And when was your first payment on that loan? 
A: It’s not that kind of a loan. It’s a—you have six years to—it’s not a traditional loan. It is you 
have six years to pay back this debt that you owe and if you don’t, then it’s a problem. Then 
we put a lien on your property.

working car, which she drives. (Tr. 54, 56.) She has a car payment of $320 per month. (Tr. 
96.) 
 
Applicant’s spouse handles their finances as well as their taxes. (Tr. 36, 57.) 
Applicant is unaware of some of their expenses, such as the amount of their cable bill and 
his spouse’s car payment, which he estimated at $138. (Tr. 56-57.) She does not inform 
him about their finances unless there is a problem. (Tr. 81.) Neither Applicant nor his 
spouse has had any formal financial counseling.(Tr. 63.) 
 
Applicant and his spouse incur $700 per month in private school costs for their 
sons.
5
 The elder of his two sons has a partial scholarship of $7,000 to cover the $12,000 
costs of his high school. (Tr. 64, 80.) Applicant’s spouse confirmed that it has been a strain 
at times to meet their expenses on only Applicant’s income. She intends to return to work 
in the near future. (Tr. 77-78.) Additional monthly expenses include $200 for cable 
television/Internet, $150 for cell phones, $200 for car insurance, and $320 for utilities. (Tr. 
95-97.) Their net discretionary income is around $400 a month with paying only one of their 
sons’ tuition costs. They typically pay their outstanding fees to the other school with their 
federal and state income tax refunds. (Tr. 100.) They received a state income tax refund of 
$1,360 for tax year 2013. (Tr. 102.)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant

Applicant’s spouse testified that until she returns to work, some of the payments are “on a holding pattern.” 
They have other bills that have taken priority, and the schools have been willing to work with them. (Tr. 96.)

is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern about financial considerations is articulated in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
 Applicant and his spouse filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2003. The SOR 
alleges that the bankruptcy was dismissed in June 2003. There is no evidence that 
Applicant was asked about the bankruptcy during his January 2, 2014 personal subject 
interview, possibly because it was outside the scope of his latest security clearance 
application. At his security clearance hearing, Applicant attributed the bankruptcy filing to 
some problems with his mortgage payments, which his spouse later clarified involved an 
$8,000 loan rather than the mortgage. Applicant also testified that some credit card debt 
was discharged in the bankruptcy. When asked to clarify the disposition of the bankruptcy, 
Applicant responded that it was partially discharged in that one or two bills were retained. 
Applicant’s spouse testified that they made a poor decision to file for bankruptcy, given 
they owed “probably less than $10,000.” She explained that their mortgage was discharged 
in bankruptcy, but that they continued to make their mortgage payments until their home 
was flooded. When confronted by Department Counsel with information that additional 
debt had been included in the bankruptcy, Applicant’s spouse admitted that the home loan, 
two credit card debts, her $36,000 in private student loans, and a $40,000 medical bill were 
 
 9 
included in the bankruptcy. Whether the bankruptcy was discharged or dismissed, it is 
evidence of financial difficulties that implicate both AG ¶ 19(a) and AG ¶ 19(c): 
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
Applicant denies that he failed to comply with state income tax filing obligations for 
tax years 2005 through 2008 (SOR 1.b) or that he owed $2,000 in delinquent state income 
taxes as of July 2014 (SOR 1.a). In his Answer, he asserted that he owed only $79 for tax 
year 2007, which he paid. The Government, who has the burden under ¶ E3.1.14 of the 
Directive to establish controverted facts, presented Applicant’s October 31, 2013 e-QIP, in 
which he responded affirmatively to whether, in the last seven years, he had failed to file or 
pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance. He indicated that he 
failed to file IRS and state income tax returns for tax year 2008 and that he had not 
satisfied $2,000 in tax debt. The Government also presented a report of subject interview 
in which Applicant not only reportedly admitted that he had not filed state income tax 
returns for tax years 2005 through 2008 totaling approximately $2,000, but also that he had 
listed only tax year 2008 on his e-QIP due to oversight. Moreover, he  indicated that he and 
his spouse had been notified by the state tax authority in early 2012 about the back taxes, 
and that he was currently in negotiations with the state to make payments and to waive 
penalties and interest. A summary of his interview containing this information was provided 
to Applicant for review and possible correction. On June 24, 2014, Applicant affirmed the 
accuracy of that account without making any changes. A clearance interview summary that 
Applicant certified as accurate is an admission by a party opponent. See ISCR Case No. 
11-13999 (App. Bd. Feb. 3, 2014). Although admissible evidence, it must be evaluated in 
light of the other evidence of record, including evidence of real estate tax delinquency of 
$14,000 for tax years 2011 and 2012. 
 
Both Applicant and his spouse denied that they owed $2,000 in past-due state 
income taxes as of the issuance of the SOR in July 2014. Applicant’s spouse, who handles 
the family’s finances, testified that perhaps Applicant was thinking about their property 
taxes when he admitted owing a tax liability. Yet, she also testified that the property taxes 
were owed for 2011 and 2012, not for 2005 through 2008. Applicant denies knowing about 
the property tax debt as of his January 2014 interview with the OPM investigator. He 
claimed that he only found out about the debt very recently. (Tr. 111.) If his testimony is 
accurate, the property tax debt would not explain his reported admissions of a state tax 
liability on his e-QIP and during his subject interview. A document from the state tax 
authority shows that Applicant and his spouse were in good standing as of May 2014, so 
presumably any state income tax delinquency has been resolved, either by payment or by 
application of tax refund monies. The evidence does not firmly establish that Applicant 
owed $2,000 in past-due state income taxes as of the issuance of the SOR in July 2014. 
AG ¶ 20(e) applies, but only to the issue of any outstanding state tax liability: 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
 
 10 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
AG ¶ 19(a) and ¶ 19(c) apply to the property tax debt, which is not disputed. 
 
The Government presented no documentation from the state indicating that 
Applicant has not filed or filed late his income tax returns for tax years 2005 through 2008. 
Applicant submitted in evidence his state income tax returns for tax years 2005, 2007, and 
2008, showing that he and his spouse were entitled to refunds for tax years 2005 and 
2008. However, it is unclear when those returns were filed. Applicant’s spouse repeatedly 
asserted that the returns, which Applicant signed the day before his hearing, were accurate 
only to show tax refunds and not for filing dates. She handled their tax returns and 
admitted that the returns could have been filed late. The state could conceivably have 
assessed a tax liability to Applicant and his spouse in 2012 based on late filings of returns 
or nonpayment of their tax debt for 2007 that Applicant’s spouse then paid around May 
2014. Applicant’s spouse admitted that “maybe” she was contacted in 2012 by the state 
about their state income taxes. (Tr. 90.) Applicant submits that they received tax refunds 
for all but tax year 2007, which suggests that returns have been filed. However, a tax 
refund does not necessarily prove that returns were filed on time. Applicant told the OPM 
investigator that his spouse told him that she thought she had filed them, but also that he 
was in negotiations with the state about his delinquent taxes, which his spouse claims 
never happened. (Tr. 90.) He told the OPM investigator that the failure to file timely returns 
was because of his and his spouse’s oversight.  AG ¶ 19(g), “failure to file annual Federal, 
state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same,” is 
implicated when income tax returns are filed late, even if they have since been filed. 
Applicant has not offered a satisfactory explanation for why he volunteered on his e-QIP 
that he failed to file his tax return for tax year 2008 if his return had been filed. If the state’s 
records were inaccurate, then Applicant should have been able to obtain some 
confirmation from the state that his tax returns were filed on time. I left the record open 
after the hearing, but nothing was submitted. 
 
Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current, reliability, or good judgment,” partially applies in that the 
bankruptcy is not recent. There is no evidence of new consumer credit card debt. However, 
it is difficult to mitigate all the financial considerations concerns under AG ¶ 20(a), even 
assuming that Applicant and his spouse have satisfied their state income tax filing and 
payment issues. Applicant and his spouse did not timely pay their 2011 and 2012 local real 
estate taxes. By mid-November 2014, their local real estate taxes for 2013 had not been 
paid. 
 
Applicant’s bankruptcy was partially caused by factors outside of his control in that 
his spouse incurred approximately $40,000 in medical debt for her daughter, which was not 
covered by insurance. AG ¶ 20(b) is only partially implicated: 
 
 
 11 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
 
Applicant’s spouse, who handles the family’s finances, stopped working when Applicant’s 
father came to live with them around 2008 or 2009. She took on the responsibility of finding 
an appropriate assisted-living facility for her disabled brother-in-law and for caring for her 
father-in-law. However burdensome the family obligations, Applicant and his spouse were 
still required to file their state income tax returns on time and to pay their property taxes 
when due. Applicant’s father died in 2012, and his spouse was still unemployed as of 
November 2014. Lack of spousal income does not satisfy AG ¶ 20(b) when it is by choice. 
Furthermore, while it understandable that Applicant and his spouse want the best for their 
sons, the expense of private school tuition is difficult to justify when their property taxes 
went unpaid. 
 
 Two mitigating conditions address debt resolution under AG ¶ 20: 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control, and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board has explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an 
applicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the 
applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term “good-faith.” 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good faith “requires a 
showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option 
(such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” 
mitigating condition].  
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 
2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). The Government 
did not allege any consumer credit debt surviving the bankruptcy, despite Applicant’s 
default on the mortgage for his previous residence. About delinquent state income tax 
returns, Applicant’s spouse testified that they were filed by 2013. (Tr. 112.) Applicant 
testified that he started being more attentive to their tax obligations in 2014, although he 
acknowledges that his spouse handled their 2013 tax returns. (Tr. 52.) As for the 
 
 12 
delinquent property taxes, he testified that he learned about them only recently. Around 
June 2014, he and his spouse were given a loan to pay their $14,000 in delinquent 
property taxes. It is unclear whether they borrowed the full $14,000 or something less to 
resolve their debt. Whether or not they brought their property taxes up-to-date with the loan 
proceeds, Applicant and his spouse had paid no more than $500 on the loan as of 
November 2014. The loan does not require monthly payments. Yet, it is difficult to mitigate 
the financial considerations concerns completely without some corroboration that all state 
income tax returns have been filed and that they are making some effort to repay the loan 
for the delinquent property taxes. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and 
all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative 
process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at 
the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) 
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
  
The financial analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. 
Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant 
additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a longtime defense contractor employee, who has met his employer’s 
expectations. Perhaps because he works 48 hours a week, and his spouse has been 
unemployed since 2008 or 2009, Applicant has taken a hands-off approach to his family’s 
finances with some negative consequences (i.e., likely late filing of state income tax returns 
and failure to pay their property taxes). He thought that his spouse’s car payments are 
$138, which is significantly less than its actual $320. He was seemingly unaware that they 
pay $150 per month for cell phone service. He has shown some financially responsible 
behavior in that he is not incurring credit card debt. He and his spouse have only one car 
between them, having chosen instead to provide private school education for their children, 
which is especially important to his spouse. At the same time, his obligations to timely file 
returns and to pay local taxes on his home were not afforded sufficient priority. Concerns 
about his financial judgment also persist because he was either unclear on the status of his 
state income tax returns as of January 2014 or he was not being fully forthright about his 
tax issues at his security clearance hearing. 
 
 
 13 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases, stating: 
 
[A]n applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid 
off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his 
financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The 
Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s 
plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and 
realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered 
in reaching a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan 
(and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at 
a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation marks 
omitted). Under the circumstances, his case in mitigation would have been aided 
substantially had he shown some payments towards his delinquent property taxes or the 
loan to resolve the real estate taxes. He was given an opportunity to supplement the 
evidentiary records after his hearing, and he submitted no documents to clarify or update 
the record about his state income tax filings and his real estate tax payments. The issue of 
the delinquent property taxes did not surface until his hearing, leaving me with some 
question about whether the DOD has an accurate understanding of Applicant’s finances. 
 
 It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security 
clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9
th
 Cir. 1990). Perhaps at some 
future date, Applicant may be able to show that he has a good handle on his finances and 
that his financial situation is sufficiently stable to no longer raise security concerns. Based 
on the record before me in light of the adjudicative guidelines that I am required to 
consider, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended 
SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:  Against Applicant 
 
 14 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
