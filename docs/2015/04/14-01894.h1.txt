GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 28, 2013, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security 
clearance application.1 On June 18, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility – Division A (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective 
September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial

Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on June 27, 2014. In a sworn statement, dated 
August 19, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was 
prepared to proceed on October 14, 2014. The case was assigned to another 
administrative judge on October 27, 2014, but reassigned to me on January 13, 2015, 
due to caseload considerations. A Notice of Hearing was issued on February 13, 2015, 
and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 10, 2015.2 
 
 During the hearing, two Joint exhibits (JE 1 and 2), four Government exhibits (GE 
1 through GE 4), and four Applicant exhibits (AE A through AE D) were admitted into 
evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on 
March 18, 2015. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant 
took advantage of that opportunity. He submitted additional documents which were 
marked as AE E through AE G. Two of the exhibits (AE E and AE F) were admitted into 
evidence without objection, and the remaining exhibit (AE G) was admitted into 
evidence over the objection of Department Counsel.3 The record closed on April 12, 
2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of the factual allegations (¶¶ 
1.a. and 1.b.), as well as a portion of the remaining allegation (¶ 1.c.), pertaining to 
financial considerations. Applicant’s answers are incorporated herein as findings of fact. 
After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:

 At the commencement of the hearing, Applicant stated that he was unaware that he could have retained an 
attorney to represent him at the hearing. Department Counsel noted that scheduling the hearing had initially been 
delayed to accommodate Applicant’s work schedule, and that, in October 2014, he had sent Applicant a letter which 
stated, in part, that Applicant could represent himself, retain an attorney, or obtain assistance from someone such as 
a union representative or family adviser.  See JE I, dated October 9, 2014, at 1. Applicant had also been sent a copy 
of the DOHA Prehearing Guidance along with the Notice of Hearing on February 13, 2015.  See JE II, undated, at 1, 
which clearly stated that Applicant had the option of being represented by an attorney selected and paid for by 
himself. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the documents and said he must have not seen those references because 
the documents were very long. Furthermore, Applicant and Department Counsel spoke on March 4, 2015, regarding 
the hearing process. When asked to decide on the issue, Applicant initially said he wanted to consult with an attorney 
and then said he wanted to get an attorney. Applicant was unsure if he even opened the envelopes containing the 
documents sent to him, or if he had read them. While Department Counsel did not object to Applicant’s motion for a 
continuance, after discussing the issue with Applicant, I denied the motion as not having been made timely and 
because good cause had not been shown by Applicant. The hearing then proceeded. See Tr. at 7-21.

 Department Counsel objected to AE G because although I had previously announced that I would keep the 
record open until March 23, 2015, and had extended the deadline until April 6, 2015 upon the request of Applicant 
with the concurrence of Department Counsel. AE G was submitted on April 12, 2015, six days after the established 
deadline and before I had commenced drafting my decision. Nevertheless, since the entire due process is also a 
search for the truth, I chose to avoid an overly restrictive interpretation of the process, and I admitted AE G over 
Department Counsel’s objection.

Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his employer since April 2014 as a special activities integrator.4 A May 1984 high school 
graduate, Applicant completed over two years of college, but did not obtain a degree.5 
He enlisted in the U.S. Army in October 1986, served on active duty until June 1999, 
when as a sergeant first class (E7) he was discharged to accept a warrant, and the 
following day continued to serve on active duty until October 2006, when he honorably 
retired as a chief warrant officer 2.6 He was granted a secret security clearance in 
1989;7 he has held a top secret security clearance since 2002; and he was granted 
access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) in 2003.8 It is unclear how or when 
his SCI access was terminated. Applicant was married in March 1993, separated in 
2009 or 2010, and divorced in January 2011.9 He and his wife have a son (born in 
1996).10  
 
Military Service and Civilian Service in Support of Military Service 
 
 During his combined military and civilian service, Applicant was repeatedly 
deployed overseas for various periods: to Iraq or Southwest Asia (September 1990 – 
April 1991; July 1995 – October 1995; September 1997 – January 1998; January 2003 
– June 2003; September 2003 – February 2004; June 2004 – March 2005; July 2005 – 
February 2006; August 2006 – February 2007; November 2007 – May 2008; July 2008 
– March 2009; to Jordan (September 2002 – December 2002); and to Afghanistan 
(October 2001 – February 2002).11  
 
 He was awarded the following awards, decorations, and badges: the Bronze Star 
Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Joint Service Commendation Medal, the 
Army Commendation Medal (five awards), the Army Achievement Medal (five awards), 
the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, the Army Good Conduct Medal (four awards), the 
National Defense Service Medal (two awards), the Southwest Asia Service Medal (three 
awards), the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary 
Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Non-
Commissioned Officer Professional Development Ribbon (three awards), the Army 
Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi 
Arabia), the Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait), the Combat Infantryman Badge (two

Financial Considerations 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2008. Because 
of his frequent overseas and domestic deployments, Applicant’s family finances were 
routinely handled by his wife and the federal tax returns were prepared by her with the 
assistance of her mother.13 There were times when the tax returns were signed by him 
and other times when they were signed for him.14 Applicant had no inkling that there 
were any unresolved financial issues until sometime in late 2009. During a period of 
marital discord, his wife remarked to him that their 2008 federal income tax return had 
not been filed.15 Despite their periodic marital discord, Applicant maintained the status 
quo by not getting involved in income tax return preparation or filing. His wife advised 
him that he might owe the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $50,000 or $60,000 in back 
taxes, and he was afraid to file the income tax returns for 2009 or 2010 out of fear that 
he might lose his residence to an IRS seizure.16  
A federal tax lien in the amount of $113,673 was filed against Applicant in August 
2011, and another lien in the amount of $64,910 was filed in January 2012.17 In 
November 2011, the IRS started garnishing his wages. After receiving correspondence 
from the IRS, but before the garnishment started, Applicant engaged the professional 
services of a tax consulting company to represent him in negotiations with the IRS to 
resolve his 2008 and 2009 federal income tax liability.18 Applicant contends the tax 
consulting company eventually filed his federal income tax returns for the tax years 
2008, 2009, and 2010, and that he was placed in an installment plan covering those 
three years. He failed to submit any documentation to support his contentions of the

multiple lawsuits, including class-action lawsuits, filed by a number of state attorneys general in which it was alleged 
that the tax consulting company was charging customers fees for resolving back tax debts, but then failed to deliver 
on their promises, and engaged in deceptive marketing and advertising practices, the tax consulting company filed for 
liquidation, closing the business, in 2012. It is unclear if Applicant ever sought guidance or clarification of his fears.

filing of the income tax returns or the installment plan.19 He did, however, submit a wage 
and income transcript from the IRS covering the tax year 2010.20 Other than reflecting 
income tax, Social Security, and Medicare withholdings, that document does not reflect 
any income tax payments made.21 Applicant has been paying the IRS $1,502 each 
month under the installment plan, but because of a downsizing, his income has been 
reduced, his payments have been erratic, and he desires to reduce his payments.22 He 
timely filed his federal income tax returns for the tax years of 2011, 2012, and 2013.23 
Since he was due refunds for those three tax years, the IRS diverted the refunds to 
reduce the outstanding balance from the earlier tax years.24  
Although Applicant met with representatives of the tax consulting company, he 
has never received any financial counseling.25 Applicant currently pays his ex-wife 
$3,100 per month in alimony and child support and she is also entitled to one-half of his 
military retirement.26 Because of his son’s age, Applicant’s responsibility for paying child 
support should be coming to an end. Other than Applicant’s delinquent income tax debt, 
there are no other delinquent accounts. While Applicant did not submit a personal 
financial statement, he estimates that because of his fluctuating income, including some 
months when he is anticipated to earn $500 per day, some months he may realize a 
larger monthly remainder than in other months.27  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”28 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access

the installment plan, payments, and the filed income tax returns, and he indicated he would do so, but he did not. The 
closure of the tax consulting company apparently made his efforts that much more difficult.

to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”29   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”30 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.31  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”32 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”33 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. In addition, a “failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax 
returns as required. . .” may raise security concerns under AG ¶ 19(g). Applicant failed 
to timely file his federal income tax returns for 2008, 2009, and 2010. As a result, the 
IRS filed two tax liens against him. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce

or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”34  
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) all partially apply. AG ¶ 20(c) does not apply. 
Applicant’s financial problems were not caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
and he did not spend beyond his means. Instead, as noted above, Applicant attributed 
his failure to file his federal income tax returns on a variety of reasons: his wife routinely 
handled the family finances and generally filed their federal income tax returns; he spent 
significant periods of time each year deployed overseas or domestically; he was going 
through periods of marital discord; he went through a separation and divorce; he did not 
have the money he was expected to pay in taxes; and he was afraid of losing his 
residence.  
Applicant was for many years a decorated combat warrior who spent significant 
periods deployed overseas and domestically. He was also clearly naive about financial 
matters. Even after learning that his federal income tax return for the tax year 2008 had 
not been timely filed by his wife, he continued to rely on her to file subsequent income 
tax returns. Applicant may have been confused regarding when and by whom his 
federal income tax returns were filed, but he was not ignorant of his legal 
responsibilities, even though he had not obtained any financial guidance. His failure to 
take more timely decisive action during the three-year period from April 2009 through 
April 2011 is acknowledged. However, he finally took the first step in resolving the 2008, 
2009, and 2010 taxes when he engaged the professional services of a tax consulting 
company to represent him in negotiations with the IRS to resolve his federal income tax 
liability. Those federal income tax returns were either filed by the tax consulting 
company or constructed by the IRS for him. Applicant has in place a repayment 
arrangement with the IRS. Under his installment agreement, he makes a monthly 
payment of $1,502 to the IRS.  
                                                          
34
 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].  
 
ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (internal citation and footnote omitted, quoting ISCR Case 
No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

This is not a situation where an applicant has an intentional lengthy period of 
irresponsible inaction regarding his federal income tax filing and payment obligations.35 
Instead, there was one year where he was unaware of his wife’s failure to file their 
federal income tax return, and two years when he basically withdrew from his 
responsibility to assure the failure did not continue. While Applicant’s judgment and 
actions in this regard can be characterized as delayed, his eventual positive responses 
and actions – essentially well-before the SOR was issued – were, in fact, generated first 
by involuntary garnishment proceedings, and second by IRS liens. He has embraced 
the paradigm of timely filing his federal income tax returns, and has established a good 
track record of doing so for the last four years. Other than guidance from his tax 
consulting company, Applicant apparently has still not received counseling from a 
financial counselor. Other than his remaining, but diminishing, combined income tax 
balance, Applicant has no other delinquent accounts. He contends, without 
documentation to support his contention, that his monthly surplus available for 
discretionary savings or spending is variable. With some periods of an anticipated wage 
of $500 per day, and with the expectation that his child custody payments should be 
reduced, that remainder should increase substantially. There are clear indications that 
Applicant’s financial problems are under control, and that he intends to avoid similar 
circumstances. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances confronting him, do not cast 
doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.36 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant failed to 
timely file federal income tax returns for the tax years 2008, 2009, and 2010. The IRS

filed two liens against him for delinquent taxes, and at one point briefly garnished his 
wages. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial than 
the disqualifying evidence. Applicant’s financial problems arose for a variety of reasons: 
his wife routinely handled the family finances and generally filed their federal income tax 
returns; he spent significant periods of time each year deployed overseas or 
domestically; his wife failed to file the federal income tax return for 2008, and he simply 
permitted the status quo to remain for two years when he failed to file federal income 
tax returns for the tax years 2009 and 2010; he was going through periods of marital 
discord; he went through a separation and divorce; he did not have the money he was 
expected to pay in taxes; and he was afraid of losing his residence.  
Applicant appears to have been overwhelmed by the entire situation. Although 
there was a multi-year period during which he failed to take more timely decisive action 
by timely filing his delinquent federal income tax returns, something finally changed. He 
sought assistance in filing those returns. Applicant has in place an installment 
arrangement with the IRS. Under a payroll deduction agreement, $1,502 is sent to the 
IRS every month. He has served a substantial period in combat zones and received 
numerous awards.  
There are other dimensions of Applicant as well. He maintained strong dedication 
to his military and civilian service while paying less attention to his marital and financial 
issues. His numerous deployments hampered his ability to ensure his tax returns were 
timely filed. Applicant’s actions under the circumstances no longer cast doubt on his 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:37 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may

provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a “meaningful track record” of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. While he failed to timely file several of his federal income tax returns, 
his explanations for those failures, and his eventual resolution efforts, are credible. This 
decision should serve as a warning that Applicant’s failure to continue his debt 
resolution efforts pertaining to his delinquent federal tax liabilities or the actual accrual 
of new delinquent debts will adversely affect his future eligibility for a security 
clearance.38 Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   For APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
     
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant, the decision, including the warning, should not 
be interpreted as being contingent on future monitoring of Applicant’s financial condition. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) has no authority to attach conditions to an applicant’s security clearance. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-03646 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 28,
