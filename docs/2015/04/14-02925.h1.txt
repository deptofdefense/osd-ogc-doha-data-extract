LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 12, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on October 6, 2014, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 27, 2015. 
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on 
March 4, 2015, scheduling the hearing for March 31, 2015. The hearing was convened 
as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without 
 
2 
 
objection. Applicant testified, called a witness, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A 
through F, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript 
(Tr.) on April 6, 2015.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked 
consistently for federal contractors since at least 1989. He seeks to retain his security 
clearance, which he has held for many years. He attended college for two years, but he 
did not obtain a degree. He has been married for more than 35 years. He has four adult 
children and an adult stepchild.1 
 
 The SOR alleges a delinquent debt of $1,140, unpaid judgments of $9,038 and 
$5,000, and that Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns from 2007 through 
2013. Applicant established that the $1,140 debt was settled, the $5,000 judgment was 
paid, and the $9,038 judgment was not awarded against him.2    
 
 Applicant did not file federal income tax returns for tax years 2007 through 2012 
when they were due. Applicant’s wife handled the family’s finances, and he trusted her 
to ensure their tax returns were filed and their taxes were paid. Before 2007, they used 
a large national tax preparation company to prepare and file their tax returns, but they 
switched to a local preparer for their 2007 through 2012 returns. The tax preparer 
moved to another state, which made it difficult to coordinate the process. Applicant’s 
wife stated that they thought Applicant had received extensions. The tax preparer filed 
Applicant’s wife’s tax returns every year using the “Married Filing Separately” status, 
and she received refunds every year. Applicant also testified that he was out of work for 
substantial periods after work-related injuries, which hindered his ability to file his tax 
returns.3   
 
 Applicant reported on his October 2013 Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86) that he did not file his tax return for tax year 2011 and noted: “The tax 
preparer I was using left town and failed to file my taxes. I have been unable to contact 
her to retrieve the documents for that tax year.” He provided similar information during 
his background interview in February 2014.4  
 
 Applicant retained the national tax preparation company to prepare and file his 
tax returns for 2007 through 2013. The returns were prepared in August 2014 and filed 
in September 2014. Applicant’s filing status on the returns was “Head of Household.”5 
The returns showed the following:

 2013  $70,441     $6,244 $8,809       -$2,5656 
 
 Applicant has not made any payments for the years he owes taxes. He hired a 
tax attorney to address his back taxes. Applicant stated that his 2014 tax return is 
prepared, and he intends to file all his future tax returns in a timely manner.7   
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
                                                          
6 AE F.

Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
 The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required or the fraudulent filing of the same. 
 
 Applicant did not file federal income tax returns when they were due for tax 
years 2007 through 2012. AG ¶ 19(g) is applicable.  
 
 Applicant established that the $1,140 debt was settled, the $5,000 judgment was 
paid, and the $9,038 judgment was not awarded against him. Those matters are 
mitigated. SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c are concluded for Applicant. 
 
 Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
 
5 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
and 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control. 
 
 Applicant claimed that he was unable to contact the tax preparer to file his 
returns. However, his wife was in regular contact with the same preparer because the 
preparer filed her returns every year. There does not appear to be a correlation between 
Applicant’s work injuries and his failure to file his tax returns. Applicant finally filed his 
tax returns in September 2014. It is unclear why he used the Head of Household filing 
status.8 He retained a lawyer to negotiate his delinquent taxes, but he still owes a 
substantial amount. 
 
 Applicant’s financial issues are recent and ongoing. I am unable to determine 
that they are unlikely to recur. They continue to cast doubt on his judgment, reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to comply with laws and regulations. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) 
are not applicable. AG ¶ 20(c) is partially applicable because the returns have been 
filed. It is not completely applicable because Applicant still owes taxes. I find that 
financial considerations concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation.9   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
                                                          
8 For a description of filing status qualifications, see http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p501.pdf.  
 
9 See ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014), in which the Appeal Board reversed the 
Administrative Judge’s decision to grant Applicant’s security clearance: 
 
Security requirements include consideration of a person’s judgment, reliability, and a 
sense of his or her legal obligations. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal 
obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability 
required of persons granted access to classified information. Indeed, the Board has 
previously noted that a person who has a history of not fulfilling their legal obligation to 
file income tax returns may be said not to have demonstrated the high degree of 
judgment and reliability required for access to classified information. (internal citation

conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has a long and stable work 
history. However, he failed to comply with a fundamental legal requirement.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not 
mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
