GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 31, 2011, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a security 
clearance application.1 On July 10, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility – Division A (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to 
all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, effective

September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on July 17, 2014. In a sworn statement, dated July 
25, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared 
to proceed on November 6, 2014. The case was assigned to me on November 14, 
2014. A Notice of Hearing was issued on December 2, 2014, and I convened the 
hearing as scheduled on December 18, 2014. 
 
 During the hearing, 4 Government exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4) and 19 Applicant 
exhibits (AE A through AE S) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
and three witnesses testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on January 6, 2015. I 
kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. Applicant took advantage of 
that opportunity. He submitted additional documents which were marked as AE T 
through AE AA and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on 
January 14, 2015. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegation pertaining to 
financial considerations (¶ 1.a.). Applicant’s answer is incorporated herein as a finding 
of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon 
due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his current employer since 2011 as a senior flight test director.2 A 1972 high school 
graduate, he has a bachelor’s of science degree from a U.S. military academy, as well 
as a master’s degree in business administration.3 Upon his June 1976 graduation from 
the military academy, Applicant entered active duty with the U.S. Air Force, and he 
remained on active duty until August 1997, when he retired honorably as a lieutenant 
colonel.4 He was granted a top secret security clearance with access to sensitive 
compartmented information (SCI) in late 2001 and mid-2002.5 His SCI access was 
administratively terminated for reasons that remain unspecified. Applicant was married 
in December 1979, and divorced in May 2000, but he and his ex-wife have continued to 
cohabit (five nights per week) since the divorce.6  He has no children.

Military Service 
 
 During his military service, Applicant was awarded the following decorations and 
awards: the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Meritorious Service Medal (with 2 devices), 
the Air Force Commendation Medal (with one device), the Air Force Achievement Medal 
(with 1 device), the Air Medal, the National Defense Service Medal (with 1 device), the 
Combat Readiness Medal, the Air Force Overseas Long Tour Ribbon (with 1 device), 
the Air Force Longevity Service Award (with 4 devices), the Small Arms Expert 
Marksmanship Ribbon (Pistol), the Air Force Training Ribbon, the Air Force Outstanding 
Unit Award (with valor device), the Air Force Organizational Excellence Award (with 1 
device), and the Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia).7 
 
Financial Considerations 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances with the one exception 
that he failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the tax years 2009, 2010, 
2011, and 2012.8 By way of explanation, Applicant stated:9 
I let my personal life be overcome by my professional life. I screwed up. I 
had an error in judgment thinking that because I owed no money to the 
Government, the Government owed me, that I could let these slide or not 
so much slide, but I let other things out prioritize my responsibility to file 
my taxes on time. I let work pressures, the pressure to get a flight test 
program out to the nth degree being reliable, overcome my need to get my 
taxes done on time. . . . So this does not excuse what I did. It in no way 
relieves of the responsibility of filing my taxes on time. I’m a role model in 
my squadron. I blew it. There’s no way you can hide from the fact that this 
was a responsibility I needed to do and I let my mindset at the time out 
prioritize because I had more pressing work or care for ex-wife to deal 
with. That’s not an excuse. . . . 
Applicant was more specific when he commented on what he perceived as the 
contributing factors that essentially led to his failures:10 
A chronically ill ex-wife who lives 10 miles away from my home of record, 
and has no other caregiver, nor significant or consistent social contact 
(other than me). . . Although we are divorced, I really never left her side;

A relentless work schedule where I allowed my responsibilities for 
planning and executing successful USAF test programs to consistently 
outweigh my personal obligation to clean up my paperwork, and file my 
taxes on time; 
Minimal leave expended due to work schedule (over 7 weeks’ current 
vacation unable to take, and weeks lost in past years due to not having 
been taken within the annual timeframe of my employers’ guidelines); 
11 years of neither me (nor anyone else) residing in my home of record 
where all my personal papers are stored. I used my residence to store my 
clothes, papers, and personal belongings – but traveled daily on from work 
to my ex-wife’s residence to take care of her; 
Computing and filing tax returns is like a pregnancy: it’s not a baby until 
every detail is fully fleshed out. All those required tax details had been 
buried in piles of paper – and it took many, many months to dig them out 
and sort them out. This was obviously necessary to provide clear, 
accurate, and auditable documentation for every line entry in each of the 
year’s tax forms. 
 On November 18, 2013, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a tax levy 
against Applicant’s wages, salary, and other income in the amount of $13,342.79 which 
was the presumed income tax liability for the tax year 2009, based on the IRS’ 
automatic filing of a Form 1040A for Applicant.11 That same day, in order to avoid 
having his wages garnished, Applicant paid the IRS the entire amount of the levy.12 An 
initial analysis performed for Applicant by a tax advisor indicated that Applicant had paid 
$18,406 in 2009 taxes by withholding, and only had a tax liability of $16,144. He was 
entitled to a refund of $2,262.13 A second look review analysis by the same tax advisor 
altered the amount of the refund due to $2,311.14 Applicant completed his U.S. 
Individual Income Tax Return (Form 1040) for the tax year 2009 on July 25, 2014 – two 
weeks after the SOR was issued – and mailed it to the IRS on August 2, 2014.15 
Applicant’s adjusted gross income for 2009 was $92,545.46.16  
Applicant completed his Form 1040 for the tax year 2010 on April 14, 2014 and 
mailed it to the IRS the following day.17 Applicant’s adjusted gross income for 2010 was

When he completed his e-QIP in August 2011, Applicant acknowledged that he 
needed to file his federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010.31 He failed to do so for 
over two years. On November 1, 2011, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator 
from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He stated he intended to file his 
tax returns for 2009 and 2010 within thirty days.32 He failed to do so because his papers 
were disorganized and his mindset gave priority to his work and his ex-wife.33 On 
December 23, 2013, Applicant was again interviewed by an OPM investigator. He 
stated that he would file his Form 1040 for the tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012 “within 
the next couple of weeks.”34 It took him four more months to file the Form 1040 for 2010 
and eight more months to file the remaining Forms 1040 for 2011 and 2012. Applicant 
now claims that “this delinquent behavior has stopped. . . [and] this delinquent financial 
behavior with the IRS will never recur.”35 
During the tax years 2009 through 2012, while Applicant was not timely filing his 
own federal income tax returns, the issues that purportedly contributed to his 
procrastination did not interfere with his timely filing of his ex-wife’s federal income tax 
returns.36 Applicant explained that her income tax returns were easy to complete, while 
his were more complicated. 
 Applicant’s current Vantage Scores from the three credit reporting agencies are 
between 957 and 965 out of a maximum of 990.37 He currently possesses two credit 
cards, and he claims he pays off the balances each month.38 However, his current 
monthly budget indicates that he has current balances of $10,083.52 in consumer 
debt.39 It is unclear which story is accurate. His current monthly income is $12,215.20; 
and his monthly payments are $12,602.60; leaving a monthly deficit of minus $387.40. 
Applicant also has assets, including real estate, vehicles, savings, retirement accounts, 
etc., of approximately $843,067.77.40

Work Performance and Character References 
 The flight test squadron commander of the organization that runs developmental 
tests has known Applicant for three years.  The quality of Applicant’s work has been 
very good, and he believes Applicant’s work is well documented and detailed. He has 
no reason to question Applicant’s trustworthiness or reliability.41A friend and fellow 
church member has known Applicant for 29 years. Applicant is very active in the church 
where, for the past year or two, he teaches Sunday school. He believes Applicant is 
reliable and exercises very good, impeccable judgment.42  The chief engineer of the 
flight test squadron has known Applicant for four years, and they interact on a daily 
basis. He characterized Applicant as “meticulous with his work product,” and he has had 
to remind Applicant that “perfection is the enemy. You’re good enough.” Applicant is 
reliable and trustworthy. Applicant’s judgment has never been questioned.43  
Since joining his current employer, Applicant has received a number of superior 
performance awards, and a general officer letter of appreciation and congratulations. He 
has also been recognized as the flight test squadron professional contractor of the 
quarter on several occasions, as well as the professional contractor of the year in 
2012.44 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”45 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”46   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating

conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”47 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.48  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”49 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”50 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict

 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes one particular relevant condition that could raise security 
concerns. Under AG ¶ 19(g), a “failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax 
returns as required. . .” is potentially disqualifying. Applicant failed to timely file his Form 
1040 for the tax years 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. AG ¶ 19(g) applies. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c).  
None of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant’s financial problems were not 
caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending, and he did not spend beyond his means. 
Instead, as noted above, his problems arose from his continued irresponsible failure to 
timely file his federal income tax returns for the tax years 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. 
Applicant attributed his failure to file those federal income tax returns to a variety of 
reasons: (1) a chronically ill ex-wife; (2) a relentless work schedule; (3) he allowed his 
work responsibilities to take priority over the timely filing of taxes; (4) he failed to take 
annual leave; and (5) his records were in complete disarray, buried in piles of paper, 
and it took many, many months to dig them out and sort them out. None of those factors 
 
10 
                                      
 
were beyond Applicant’s control. Furthermore, although Applicant failed to timely file his 
federal income tax returns for the tax years 2009 through 2012, he was able to timely 
file his ex-wife’s federal income tax returns. 
Applicant had numerous opportunities over the years to resolve his repeated 
failures to timely file his income tax returns, but he failed to do so. Instead, he made 
promises which, for a variety of reasons that he offered to explain his procrastination, he 
failed to fulfill. In August 2011, when he completed his e-QIP, Applicant acknowledged 
that he needed to file his federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. He failed to do 
so for over two years. On November 1, 2011, when he was interviewed by an OPM 
investigator, he stated he intended to file those same tax returns within thirty days. He 
failed to do so. On December 23, 2013, Applicant was again interviewed, and he stated 
that he would file his Form 1040 for the tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012 “within the next 
couple of weeks.” It took him four more months to file the Form 1040 for 2010 and eight 
more months to file the remaining Forms 1040 for 2011 and 2012. Applicant now claims 
that his delinquent behavior has stopped and that it will never recur. Based on his past 
history, there is little confidence that it will not recur. 
This is a situation where an applicant has a lengthy period of irresponsible 
inaction regarding his federal income tax filing obligations.51 Applicant’s actions can be 
characterized as repeated procrastination and delay. He repeatedly made promises and 
he failed to fulfill those promises for extensive periods. His initial action was generated 
in November 2013 after the IRS had filed a tax levy for his 2009 taxes. His next action 
was to file his Form 1040 for the tax year 2010 in April 2014. Applicant’s eventual 
responses and actions regarding his income tax returns for the tax years 2011 and 2012 
did not occur until two weeks after the SOR was issued. While there is evidence that an 
independent tax advisor audited his late Forms 1040, there is no evidence that 
Applicant has received financial counseling. Applicant’s actions under the 
circumstances, do cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.52 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of

rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant is: a 
graduate of a U.S. military academy; a highly decorated retired Air Force officer; a well 
thought-of civilian contractor; active in his church; and a caring and devoted ex-
husband. His financial accounts appear to be current. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial 
than the mitigating evidence. Applicant’s problems arose from his continued 
irresponsible failure to timely file his federal income tax returns. None of the factors 
cited by Applicant as leading to his inactions were beyond his control. There is evidence 
that Applicant exercises very good, impeccable judgment, and that he is meticulous with 
his work product. Yet, Applicant, himself, described his tax records as being in complete 
disarray, buried in piles of paper, and that it took many, many months to dig them out 
and sort them out. As noted above, Applicant had numerous opportunities over the 
years to resolve his repeated failures to timely file his income tax returns, but he failed 
to do so. Instead, he made promises which, for a variety of reasons that he offered to 
explain his procrastination, he failed to fulfill. Applicant now claims that his delinquent 
behavior has stopped and that it will never recur. Based on his past history, there is little 
confidence that it will not recur.  
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as 
to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
   
     
  
 
12 
                                      
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
