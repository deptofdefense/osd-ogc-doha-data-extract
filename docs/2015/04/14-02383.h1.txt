LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 16, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on October 15, 2014, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 27, 2015. 
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on 
March 4, 2015, scheduling the hearing for March 30, 2015. The hearing was convened 
as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without 
 
2 
 
objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A and B, which 
were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 7, 
2015.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his current employer since 2008. He served in the U.S. military from 1991 until he was 
honorably retired with a disability in 2007. He attended college for a period, but he did 
not earn a degree. He has been married for more than 20 years. He has a seven-year-
old child.1 
 
 The SOR alleges five delinquent debts, with balances totaling $105,114, and that 
Applicant lost his home to foreclosure. The debts include a charged-off home equity line 
of credit ($85,427),2 deficiencies owed on auto loans after the vehicles were 
repossessed ($13,122 and $3,894), and credit card debt ($1,691 and $980). Applicant 
admits that he lost his home to foreclosure and that he owes all the debts, but he stated 
that the debts will be addressed in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case.   
 
 Applicant and his wife bought a house in 1998 for about $123,000. It was 
financed through a $124,635 mortgage loan. He refinanced the mortgage loan in 2004. 
The March 2013 credit report indicates the high credit on the loan was $170,000. In 
2005, he opened a home equity line of credit that was secured by the home. The credit 
limit was $87,000. Applicant stated that he spent over $40,000 in improvements to the 
home. The March 2013 credit report shows $85,427 as the reported amount for the high 
credit, the past-due amount, and the balance.3  
 
 In 2005, Applicant bought a used 2003 luxury sport utility vehicle (SUV), which 
he described as his “dream car.” The March 2013 credit report indicates the high credit 
on the auto loan was $36,180.4 
 
 Applicant used some of the proceeds from the home equity line of credit to pay 
for fertility treatments for his wife. She had to stop working during her high-risk 
pregnancy. She did not return to work until January 2008.5 
 
 Applicant’s medical problems necessitated his discharge from the military in 
2007. He is no longer physically capable of working with the sought-after skills he

2 It is not completely clear whether this debt is a straight second mortgage loan or a home equity line of 
credit that was secured by the home. It appears to be the latter and will be referred to by that term. The 
distinction would have no effect on this decision.

learned in the military, which would have enabled him to earn a higher income. He 
receives 90% disability pay from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which is 
currently $2,100 per month. He does not receive separate retirement pay from the 
military.6 
 
 Applicant was unable to find suitable employment after his discharge. He had 
periods of unemployment and underemployment until he was hired by his current 
employer in 2008. Even with his VA disability pay, he is earning less than when he was 
in the military.7  
 
 Applicant had a long commute for work, and gas prices were high. In 2008, he 
traded the SUV in for a more fuel-efficient used 2006 luxury car. The March 2013 credit 
report indicates the high credit on the auto loan was $30,411.8 
 
 In February 2011, Applicant sold two older-model vehicles and bought a used 
2005 luxury SUV, financed through an auto loan. The March 2013 credit report indicates 
the high credit on the auto loan was $13,138. The terms were reported as $401 per 
month for 60 months.9 
 
 Applicant’s wife stopped working in mid-2012. She had medical issues, and 
commuting costs and child care expenses were high. Applicant could not afford to pay 
all his bills and his mortgage loan on his income alone. He unsuccessfully attempted to 
refinance, modify the mortgage loan, utilize other government-sponsored mortgage-
relief programs, or conduct a short sale of his home. The neighborhood had 
deteriorated, making it unsafe for his wife and child. He discussed his options with an 
attorney, who advised him to stop paying his bills and file bankruptcy. Applicant stopped 
paying his bills and started saving for the $1,500 retainer fee for his bankruptcy 
attorney. He moved out of the home in December 2012 in anticipation of, or pursuant to, 
foreclosure proceedings.10 
 
 Applicant decided to voluntarily return the 2005 SUV and the 2006 car, sell a 
classic car he owned, and buy another vehicle. The 2005 SUV was returned to the 
lienholder, but the lienholder of the 2006 car refused to accept it as a repossession. He 
told the lienholder that he was planning to file bankruptcy, and the lienholder told him 
that it could not accept the vehicle until he had a bankruptcy case file number. The 
March 2013 credit report listed the loan as charged off, with $13,122 past due and a 
$13,122 balance. The date of last action on the loan was June 2012. Applicant still has 
the car, but he has made no payments on the car loan in several years. Applicant’s

parents-in-law bought a car in their name and gave it to Applicant and his wife, who 
agreed to make the loan payments on the car.11 
 
 Applicant believes the foreclosed home sold for about $150,000. He and his wife 
live in a property owned by his parents-in-law and pay them rent. Applicant’s parents-in-
law placed their home in Applicant’s wife’s name “in case something happened to 
them.” That had implications on the bankruptcy. The property had to be deeded back to 
the parents-in-law, which delayed the filing of the bankruptcy.12  
 
 Applicant and his wife filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in March 2015. Under 
Schedule D, Creditors Holding Secured Claims, the petition listed $26,510 in claims for 
a $497 homeowners association lien and two auto loans, including the charged-off loan 
on the 2006 car and the loan in the in-laws’ names. There were no unsecured priority 
claims. Under Schedule F, Creditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority Claims, the petition 
listed debts totaling $275,002. That amount included $153,030 for the mortgage loan on 
Applicant’s foreclosed home and $85,427 for the home equity line of credit. Also 
included was $3,894 for the deficiency owed on the loan for the voluntarily-returned 
2005 SUV. The two credit card debts from the SOR were also listed in the petition.13 
 
 The proposed bankruptcy plan calls for 60 monthly payments of $360, for a total 
amount of $21,600. Estimated trustee’s fees of $2,160 and additional attorney’s fees of 
$4,474 will be paid through the plan. Applicant retained the 2006 car. The proposed 
plan calls for $155 per month, for a total of $9,351, to be paid to the lienholder of the 
2006 car. The loan on the 2010 car in the in-laws’ names is to be paid outside the 
bankruptcy.14 
 
 Applicant received financial counseling as a requirement of the bankruptcy. He 
stated that he will continue with an approved bankruptcy plan. He stated that his wife 
has a part-time job at their child’s school, but it is sporadic. The bankruptcy petition did 
not list any income for his wife. His wife is looking for another job, and Applicant is 
looking for better job prospects. He is also contemplating returning to school and using 
his G.I. Bill benefits.15 
  
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially

disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
 
6 
 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
 The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant was unable to pay his financial obligations. The above disqualifying 
conditions are applicable.  
 
 Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Applicant’s medical problems necessitated an early retirement from the military. 
He had periods of unemployment and underemployment until he was hired by his 
current employer in 2008. Even with his VA disability pay, he is earning less than when 
he was in the military. His wife had a high-risk pregnancy and was out of work until 
January 2008. His wife stopped working in 2012, at least partially because of her 
medical condition. Those events were beyond his control. To be fully applicable, AG ¶ 
20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances.  
 
 Applicant followed his attorney’s advice and stopped paying his bills in 2012 in 
anticipation of his bankruptcy. The bankruptcy went unfiled for almost three years, yet 
Applicant still did not pay any of his debts. Meanwhile, he is driving a 2006 luxury car 
that he has not made a payment on since June 2012. The bankruptcy plan has not been 
approved, and Applicant has not made any payments to the plan. What is lacking is a 
 
7 
 
track record of consistent payments towards his debts or the bankruptcy. It is too soon 
to conclude that the plan will be approved, and Applicant will adhere to it. 
 
 I am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances or 
that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial issues are recent. They 
continue to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 
20(a) and 20(d) are not applicable. AG ¶ 20(b) is partially applicable. The first part of 
AG ¶ 20(c) is applicable because Applicant received financial counseling as a 
requirement of his bankruptcy. The second part is not applicable. I find that financial 
concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  
 
I also considered Applicant’s honorable military service. However, Applicant has 
a history of financial problems. It is too soon to conclude that he will resolve those 
problems through his Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not 
mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.f:   Against Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
