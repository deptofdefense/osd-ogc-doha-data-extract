HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges three debts totaling $105,345 
and a Chapter 13 bankruptcy dismissed in December 2011. He brought his mortgage to 
current status, and paid his vehicle loan. After his Chapter 13 bankruptcy was 
dismissed, Applicant did not make sufficient progress bringing his Chapter 13 debts to 
current status. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility 
for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 12, 2013, Applicant signed and submitted an Electronic 
Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86). (GE 1) On November 7, 
2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) 
issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), 
which became effective on September 1, 2006.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(HE 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOD could not make the affirmative finding 
under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue 
a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge 
to determine whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked. (HE 2) 
 
On November 20, 2014, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) On February 
10, 2015, Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On February 24, 2015, DOHA 
assigned the case to me. On March 18, 2015, DOHA issued a notice of the hearing, 
setting the hearing for March 24, 2015. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled 
using video teleconference. Applicant waived his right to 15 days of notice of the date, 
time, and place of the hearing. (Tr. 16-17) Department Counsel offered five exhibits into 
evidence, and Applicant offered seven exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 21-26; GE 1-5; AE A-
G) There were no objections, and I admitted all proffered exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 23-
22, 26; GE 1-5; AE A-G) On April 1, 2015, I received the transcript of the hearing.   
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.d. 
He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. His admissions are accepted 
as findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is 61 years old, and he has been working part time as a research 
consultant since January 2013. (Tr. 6, 30-31; GE 1) In 1971, he graduated from high 
school. (Tr. 7) In 1982, he received a bachelor’s of science degree in business, and in 
1994, he received a master’s degree in aerospace and aeronautical science. (Tr. 7-8)  
 
Applicant served in the Air Force from 1971 to 1979. (Tr. 8) He attended college, 
and then he resumed his Air Force career, serving on active duty from 1982 until 1995, 
retiring as a captain. (Tr. 8-9) For most of his Air Force career, he held a security 
clearance. (Tr. 28) There is no evidence of security violations. (Tr. 28) In 1971, 
Applicant married his current spouse, and his five children are ages 21, 38, 40, 43, and 
45. (Tr. 9-10) His 21-year-old daughter lives at home with Applicant and his spouse. (Tr. 
10)  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
In 2005, Applicant purchased a condominium for $66,000. (Tr. 34) He was 
transferred, and he purchased another property. (Tr. 37-38)  In 2007, Applicant was in a 
vehicle accident, and he went on sick leave because of an injury to his back. (Tr. 34, 63-
64) He had a reduction of income because he worked less hours and could not work 
overtime. (Tr. 35) Before 2007, all of his debts were current. (Tr. 36, 40)

In 2007, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. 
(Tr. 20; 36; SOR response) His payments began in March 2008. (GE 2 at 43) In April 
2011, the trustee modified the payments; in August 2011, the trustee “filed action to 
remedy default;” and his bankruptcy was dismissed in December 2011. (GE 2 at 21) 
The bankruptcy trustee filed his report on the distribution of payments in April 2012. (GE 
2 at 25) Applicant estimated that his debts were about $250,000; however, his two 
mortgage accounts alone totaled about $400,000. (Tr. 39-40; GE 2 at 44-45) He owed 
real estate taxes to two states and income taxes to one state. (Tr. 41-43; GE 2 at 44-45) 
Applicant filed his tax returns late for 2009 and 2010. (Tr. 44) He said he is now current 
on his state and federal taxes. (Tr. 44-45) 
 
Applicant worked for the same large company from 1999 to May 2009, when he 
was laid off from his employment. (Tr. 20, 33) As a severance package, he received 
four months of pay and six months of health and life insurance. (Tr. 32) He was 
unemployed from May 2009 to January 2013. (Tr. 31) He received unemployment 
compensation and military retirement pay. (Tr. 32) Applicant estimated he was receiving 
about $7,000 a month after May 2009. (Tr. 33)  
 
From 2008 to 2011, Applicant paid the bankruptcy trustee a total of $171,709. 
(Tr. 45; GE 2 at 44) Applicant said there was confusion about mortgage payments, 
condominium association fees, and insurance payments, and the trustee moved to 
dismiss the bankruptcy for material default. (Tr. 47; GE 2 at 43) Applicant told a DOD 
investigator that he intended to refile his bankruptcy in April or May 2013. (Tr. 48, 58) 
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges three debts totaling $105,345: SOR ¶ 1.a is a personal 
loan for about $12,000, which has been reduced through payments to about $11,000; 
SOR ¶ 1.c is a delinquent mortgage account with a past-due amount of $69,455; and 
SOR ¶ 1.d is a charged-off account for a vehicle for $23,880. He has not made any 
payments to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.a since 2011. Applicant had a mortgage in the 
amount of about $320,000. (GE 2 at 45) The mortgage account was refinanced a year 
ago, and it is now current. (Tr. 51-52, 80) He said the vehicle debt in SOR ¶ 1.d was 
paid off in 2008, and his 2012 bankruptcy trustee report shows the scheduled claim is 
$33,254; the claim asserted is $8,312; the claim allowed is $8,312; the principal paid is 
$8,312; and the interest paid is $1,274. (Tr. 56; GE 2 at 46)  
 
Applicant’s current monthly income is about $3,700. (Tr. 57) This includes his 
seventy percent disability from the Department of Veterans Affairs (about $1,700 a 
month) (VA) and his retired pay as a captain (about $2,500 a month). (Tr. 73-75) His 
monthly mortgage is $1,600; his monthly utilities are $300; and his other monthly 
expenses are about $850. (Tr. 67-69) He preferred paying his debts versus utilization of 
bankruptcy. (Tr. 57) Applicant’s only employment is his part-time employment, which 
provided less than $1,000 last year. (Tr. 57)  
 
Applicant is currently being contacted by about 20 of his creditors, who are 
seeking about $75,000 from him. (Tr. 59-60, 71) He believed his total non-mortgage 
debt was about $75,000. (Tr. 71) He pays a debt for a credit card issued by the post 
exchange. (Tr. 75) He maintains two credit cards in current status; however, he does 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
not believe he has the income to pay any of his other creditors. (Tr. 60, 69-70) If he 
receives a substantial pay increase, he intends to pay his creditors. (Tr. 62) He received 
financial counseling as part of his bankruptcy. (Tr. 70) 
  
Applicant’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy shows about 40 unsecured scheduled claims, 
totaling more than $100,000. (GE 2 at 1-16, 26-40, 44-46) Some of the larger 
unsecured debts are for credit card debts owed to various creditors for $5,500; $6,000; 
$20,000; and $6,200. (Tr. 76-80) He has not made any payments to these four creditors 
since 2011. (Tr. 76-80)    
 
Character Evidence 
 
Applicant provided statements from his son, daughters, friends, and neighbors.2 
The letters laud his patriotism, professionalism, organization skills, competence, 
conscientiousness, intelligence, knowledge, diligence, dependability, dedication, and 
trustworthiness. Their statements support reinstatement of his security clearance. 
            
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
                                            
2The statements in AE B-G are the sources for the facts in this paragraph.

a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, SOR response, bankruptcy, and hearing record. Applicant’s bankruptcy 
shows about 40 debts totaling about $500,000, including about $400,000 in secured 
debts, and $100,000 in unsecured nonpriority debts. The Government established the 
disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the 
possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  
 
Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;3 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
                                            
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the good-faith mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the good-faith mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for 
access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
None of the mitigating conditions apply to all of his SOR allegations. 
Nevertheless, there is some mitigating financial information. Applicant’s delinquent debt 
initially resulted from a reduction of income when he was unable to work overtime in 
2007 due to a vehicle accident. In 2009, he lost his employment that he had held for ten 
years. These are circumstances beyond his control under AG ¶ 20(b). Since 2009, he 
has been living on his military retired pay, his VA disability, and unemployment. For 
several years his income was about $7,000 per month. In 2007, he filed for protection 
under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, and he began making payments in 2008. He 
allowed his bankruptcy to be dismissed in December 2011. Other than the SOR debts, 
he maintained most of his other debts in current status.   
 
After his bankruptcy was dismissed, Applicant refinanced his mortgage; he said 
he has been making payments; and he did not provide documentary proof of any post-
bankruptcy mortgage payments; however, his verbal statement of bringing his mortgage 
to current status is accepted as credible, and the mortgage debt in SOR ¶ 1.c is 
mitigated. The Chapter 13 trustee paid off the vehicle-related debt in SOR ¶ 1.d, and 
SOR ¶ 1.d is mitigated. AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply to any of his debts because he did 
not provide “documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.”   
 
 Applicant’s bankruptcy trustee’s 2012 report shows a list of about 40 unsecured 
debts totaling about $100,000. He said he is making payments on two credit cards and 
a post exchange issued credit card debt. He did not show how much he had paid these 
three creditors. He did not provide a detailed budget. He did not provide a clear 
explanation for the dismissal of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy, as opposed to a 
restructuring, assuming a restructuring was necessary. Applicant did not take 
reasonable and responsible actions to resolve his SOR debts. There are not clear 
indications the problem is being resolved and is under control. He received financial 
counseling; however, he did not establish that he was unable to make more payments 
to more of his bankruptcy creditors. His efforts are insufficient to fully mitigate financial 
considerations security concerns.

 Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There is some evidence supporting Applicant’s continued access to classified 
information; however, this evidence is not sufficient to mitigate security concerns.  
Applicant is a 61-year-old part-time research consultant. In 1982, he received a 
bachelor’s of science degree in business, and in 1994, he received a master’s degree in 
aerospace and aeronautical science. He served in the Air Force from 1971 to 1979, and 
from 1982 until 1995, retiring as a captain. For most of his Air Force career, he held a 
security clearance, and there is no evidence of security violations. Statements from his 
daughters, son, friends, and neighbors laud his patriotism, professionalism, organization 
skills, competence, conscientiousness, intelligence, knowledge, diligence, 
dependability, dedication, and trustworthiness. A vehicle accident in 2007 and 
unemployment and underemployment from 2009 to the present are circumstances 
beyond his control that contributed to his financial problems. 
 
The factors weighing towards reinstatement of Applicant’s security clearance are 
less substantial than the factors weighing against its reinstatement. Applicant filed for 
bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code in 2007, and he began 
making payments into the bankruptcy plan in March 2008. In December 2011, his 
bankruptcy petition was dismissed. Applicant’s explanation for the dismissal (problems 
relating to his condo) does not establish that dismissal of his bankruptcy was necessary. 
He did not show sufficient progress since 2012 on the debts listed in his bankruptcy 
trustee’s report to establish there are clear indications the problem is being resolved 
and his finances are under control. He did not provide a detailed budget or provide a 
credible plan for resolution of his debts. He did not act responsibly under the 
circumstances, and his financial problems are likely to continue. He did not provide 
documentation showing he disputed any of his SOR debts. The record does not show

enough evidence of inability to pay debts, documented financial progress, financial 
effort, good judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability to warrant mitigation of financial 
considerations security concerns.  
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. Unmitigated financial considerations concerns lead me to conclude 
that reinstatement of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this time. This 
decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not 
attain the state of reform necessary to justify the award of a security clearance in the 
future. With more effort towards resolving his past-due debts, and a track record of 
behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive 
evidence of his worthiness for a security clearance.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude Applicant has not carried 
his burden and financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access 
to classified information is denied. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
 Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  Against Applicant 
    Subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
