DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, 
financial considerations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 15, 2014, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD CAF could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
 
2 
 
 
interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. On August 3, 2014, Applicant answered 
the SOR and requested a hearing. This case was assigned to me on November 5, 
2014. On November 24, 2014, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling the hearing for December 10, 2014. The hearing 
was held as scheduled.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 
through 3, while Applicant testified and offered Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through I. 
The record of the proceeding was left open until January 7, 2015, to provide Applicant 
an opportunity to present additional matters. The deadline for submitting matters was 
later extended to February 2, 2015, and then again to February 6, 2015. Applicant 
submitted documents that were marked as AE J through AP. All proffered exhibits were 
admitted into evidence without objection. The transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was 
received on December 22, 2014. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 58-year-old partner in an electrical contracting business. On 
November 5, 2013, he submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations 
Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance. He graduated from high school in 
1974. He has never been married and has three children, ages 16, 24, and 27. This is 
the first time that he is seeking to obtain a security clearance.1 
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant had 12 delinquent debts totaling $96,744. In his 
Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied each allegation. A credit report dated November 
28, 2013, contains substantial evidence of each alleged debt.2 
 
Applicant started his business in 1980. Prior to encountering his financial 
problems, his business had about 30 employees. At its peak in the 1990s, his business 
had a gross income of about $18 million. In the early 2000s, its average annual revenue 
was about $2 or $3 million. In 2006 and 2007, his business suffered during an economic 
downturn that resulted in the termination of a number of his longstanding electrical 
maintenance contracts. By about 2009 or 2010, he laid off virtually all of his employees 
and he ended up living in the company’s building. To address his financial problems, he 
attempted to sell some of his real estate holdings, but was unsuccessful in doing so. He 
used credit cards to pay bills and keep his business running. At least one of his 
properties was foreclosed. In the last three years, his company rebounded when it 
obtained contracts to perform work at U.S. military bases overseas. The number of his 
employees grew to as high as 90. Its annual gross income grew to about $18 to $20 
million for a couple of years. However, a major DOD contract ended in September 2014,

2 Applicant’s Answer to the SOR; GE 3.  “It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit 
report can normally meet the substantial basis standard and the government’s obligation under ¶ E3.1.14 
[of the Directive] for pertinent allegations.” See ISCR 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010).

and the number of his employee was reduced to about 12 by the time of the hearing. He 
testified that about 90% of his business’s gross income was recently attributable to DOD 
contracts.3 
 
In 2012, Applicant’s personal adjusted gross income (AGI) was $2,549,228 and 
his federal income tax liability was $822,829. In 2013, his AGI was $1,136,776 and his 
federal income tax liability was $346,966. In May 2014, he reported on a personal 
financial statement that he had $2,509,776 in personal assets and a joint interest in his 
business that had a total value of about $3,500,000. He testified that he did not prepay 
his 2012 federal income taxes and wrote a check to pay them. Because his company 
did not have credit, he maintained a large cash reserve to support its operations. He 
indicated that he was paying about $500,000 per month to his employees as wages at 
one point.4 
 
After his business rebounded, Applicant hired an attorney and a certified public 
accountant (CPA) to assist him with his financial problems. His goal was to resolve 
those problems so that his business could qualify for credit. He testified that, after 14 
months, the attorney seemed to address only one of the alleged debts and some other 
debts that were not alleged. He was disappointed with their progress. Due to that 
disappointment, he indicated that he terminated the services of the attorney and CPA 
and hired a larger CPA firm to assist him. In his post-hearing submission, however, he 
provided letters from the attorney that indicated the attorney was still representing him 
in resolving the delinquent debts. He testified that he received financial counseling from 
the attorney and CPA.5 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a – collection account for $8,785. This was a bank account that had a 
date of last activity of November 2013. Applicant testified that this account was closed. 
He presented a letter from the collection company dated November 26, 2014, stating 
that it was a passive-debt buyer. The letter also indicated the debt was charged off by 
the original creditor, and its current status was listed as “Closed – Cancelled.” Applicant 
testified that he had not received an Internal Revenue Service 1099-C for this debt.6  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b – state tax lien for $686. This lien was filed in January 2013. Applicant 
testified that this was a property tax for a boat slip on a lake and that it was paid. In his 
post-hearing submission, he provided a court record showing the lien was satisfied and 
ordered cancelled on November 27, 2013.7

SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d – state tax liens for $231 and 73, respectively. These liens 
were filed in 2010. Applicant testified that these were for property taxes for undeveloped 
land he owned and that they were paid. In his post-hearing submission, he provided 
court records showing these liens were satisfied and ordered cancelled on October 23, 
2012.8  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f – collection accounts for $1,258 and $8,199, respectively. 
These were business credit card accounts from the same creditor. The debt in SOR ¶ 
1.e was opened in February 2005 and had a date of last activity of March 2011. The 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.f was opened in November 2003 and had a date of last activity of 
December 2010. At the hearing, Applicant testified that these accounts were closed and 
not paid. In his post-hearing submission, he provided documentation showing that he 
settled and paid the debts on February 9, 2015. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.e was settled for 
$1,046, while the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f was settled for $6,886.9  
 
SOR ¶ 1.g – collection account for $27,005. This was a credit card account. 
Records reflect that Applicant has owed the alleged amount since at least July 2011. At 
the hearing, Applicant provided an email exchange that indicated he was a defendant in 
a legal action concerning this debt and a settlement was being proposed. He testified 
that he was unaware that he was being sued concerning this debt. In his post-hearing 
submission, he provided documents confirming that he was sued for this debt. In his 
answer to the plaintiff’s complaint, Applicant raised a number of challenges to the claim 
against him, including that it was barred by the statute of limitations and that the creditor 
failed to give him “all credits properly due.” He also brought a counterclaim seeking, in 
part, payment of his attorney’s fees and $1,000 in damages for violation of debt 
collection laws. In the post-hearing submission, he also provided a Settlement 
Agreement and Release dated October 2, 2014. This document indicated that Applicant 
and the collection company released the other from any claims arising from this debt, its 
collection, or credit reporting. The agreement indicated that it did not constitute an 
admission by either party of any liability, violation of any law or regulation, or any civil 
wrong. Applicant signed the document, but the signature block for the collection 
company was blank. Nonetheless, the email chain presented at the hearing indicated 
the collection company had agreed to the release. The reason why the collection 
company agreed to release its claim is unknown.10  
 
SOR ¶ 1.h – collection account for $32,736. This was a charged-off second 
mortgage loan on a condo that Applicant purchased for $300,000 in 2006. The condo 
was financed with an 80% first mortgage loan and 20% second mortgage loan. The 
account had a date of last activity of October 2010. The property was foreclosed and 
sold. Applicant did not know the sales price in the foreclosure proceeding. In his post-

hearing submission, Applicant provided a letter from his attorney dated January 30, 
2015, indicating that Applicant was disputing this debt and five other SOR debts, 
including the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f that were settled for reduced amounts in 
February 2015. The letter indicated the collection attempts and credit reporting by the 
creditors gave rise to claims under the Fair Debt Collection Act, Fair Credit Reporting 
Act, and the state’s Fair Business Practices Act. The letter further stated: 
 
We have thoroughly investigated these matters and are prepared to file 
action on behalf of our Client for the legally deficient practices employed in 
attempting to collect and report on the aforementioned consumer 
accounts, as either 1) our Client paid all sums owing in connection with 
the alleged accounts to the original creditor for such accounts, before the 
current creditors’ collection and reporting activities began; or 2) the 
Opposing Creditors failed to give our Client all credits properly due in 
connection with the alleged accounts. Of course no lawyer can guarantee 
the final outcome of a legal matter, and we have made no promises about 
the outcome of these matters, however we anticipate favorable outcomes 
and settlements. Since 2010, our firm has settled hundreds of similar 
cases whereby our clients paid nothing to the opposing creditors, the 
opposing creditors dismissed collection activity and reporting, and they 
removed the associated trade lines from our clients’ credit reports. We 
anticipate a similar and consistent outcome in [Applicant’s] cases. 
[Emphasis added.]11 
     
SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.l – collection accounts for $209 and $9,266, respectively. The 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.i was a television service account that had a date of last activity of 
January 2012. Applicant testified that he never had an account with that television 
service provider. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.l was a bank loan that had a date of last activity 
of November 2013. These were listed as disputed debts in the attorney’s letter 
discussed above in relation to SOR ¶ 1.h.12 
 
SOR ¶ 1.j – collection account for $614. This was a utility account that had a date 
of last activity of October 2011. In Applicant’s post-hearing submission, he presented a 
receipt showing he paid this debt on January 10, 2014.13  
 
SOR ¶ 1.k – collection account for $7,682. This debt was a credit card account 
that had a date of last activity of November 2013. It was listed as a disputed debt in the 
attorney’s letter discussed above in relation to SOR ¶ 1.h. His post-hearing submission 
also included an email exchange that initially indicated that Applicant believed he did

not owe anything on this account because he already paid it, but it later indicated he 
was willing to settle this debt by paying $2,234 and disputed the remaining balance of 
$6,703. By the time the record closed, no evidence was presented to show this debt 
was resolved.14 
 
At some point, the building that Applicant’s business occupies was placed in a 
foreclosure status. This debt was not alleged in the SOR. He testified that, after his 
business began to recover, he was able to pay $57,000 to satisfy the mortgage. He and 
apparently his partner now own the building.15 
 
During an Office of Personnel Management interview in December 2013, 
Applicant indicated that, although he was unaware of the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.e-1.g 
and 1.i-1.k, he did not dispute them. During that interview, he also indicated that he 
disputed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h and that he would contact the creditor of the debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.l and make payment arrangements for that debt. At the hearing, Applicant was 
informed that the documents that he presented (AE A through I) were inadequate and 
that his post-hearing submission was critical.16 
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
                                                          
14 Tr. 34, 49, 64-65; GE 2, 3; AE K, AA, AD, AF. 
15 Tr. 74-79; AE M, N. Conduct not alleged in the SOR will not be considering in applying the 
disqualifying conditions, but “may be considered (a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an 
applicant’s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an 
applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular adjudicative 
guideline is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis under Directive Section 6.3    
. . . ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct 24, 2003).” ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct 
26, 2006).

applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, to reach his decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
 
8 
 
 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts that he was unable or 
unwilling to satisfy for an extended period. Record evidence is sufficient to raise the 
above disqualifying conditions. 
 
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
  
 Applicant’s business lost a number of contracts during an economic downturn in 
the late 2000s. Due to the downturn, he laid off virtually all of his employees and 
struggled financially. This economic downturn was a condition beyond his control that 
caused his financial problems. AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. 
 
 
9 
 
 
 Although Applicant’s financial problems were caused by conditions beyond his 
control, he has not shown that he acted responsibly in addressing his delinquent debts. 
In this regard, the evidence established: 
 
 a. Applicant’s personal income was $2.5 million in 2012 and $1.1 million in 2013. 
At some point, this case transformed from a situation in which he was unable to satisfy 
his debts to one reflecting an apparent unwillingness or reluctance to satisfy them. He 
has had adequate time since his business rebounded to resolve all of the debts. He was 
put on notice that the debts were a security concern during his December 2013 OPM 
interview and in the April 2014 SOR. At the hearing, he was informed that the 
documents he presented there were not sufficient to mitigate the security concerns. He 
was given almost two months to submit post-hearing matters. Although he has the 
apparent means to resolve these debts, a number of them remained unresolved at the 
close of the record.   
 
 b. Applicant considers the $8,785 debt in SOR 1.a resolved because it has been 
charged off. While the collection company is not actively pursuing this debt, his position 
on this debt does not constitute a “good-faith” resolution under AG ¶ 20(d).17 
 
 c. Before the issuance of the SOR, Applicant paid the relatively small tax liens in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.d and the utility debt in SOR ¶ 1.j. He settled the debts in SOR ¶¶ 
1.e and 1.f after the hearing was held. He receives credit under AG ¶ 20(d) for resolving 
the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.d and 1.j and receives credit under AG ¶ 20(c) for 
resolving the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f.  
 
 d. A collection company sued Applicant to collect the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g. 
Applicant responded by raising a number of legal defenses, including that collection 
efforts were barred by the statute of limitations, and brought a counterclaim against the 
collection company.18 This matter was settled by each party releasing the other from 
                                                          
17 The Appeal Board has stated, 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the former version of AG ¶ 20(d)], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant's debts. The Directive does not 
define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [AG 20(d)].   
 
See ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 
(App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). 
 
18 Although Applicant legally may rely on the running of the statute of limitations to avoid payment 
of a debt, such reliance does not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve debts within the meaning of the 
Directive. See ISCR Case No. 08-18900 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. 
June 25, 2008).

any liability. Why this creditor decided to sign the release is unknown. However, it is well 
known that creditors decide not to pursue debts for many reasons, including a simple 
cost-benefit analysis. From the evidence presented, I am unable to find that full credit 
under AG ¶ 20(d) for a “good-faith” resolution of this debt is warranted. Whether he had 
a reasonable basis to dispute this debt under AG ¶ 20(e) is unknown. I find for Applicant 
on this debt under AG ¶ 20(c) because it is resolved. 
 
 e. The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.i, 1.k, and 1.l that total $49,893 remain 
unresolved. Applicant submitted a letter dated January 30, 2015, from his attorney that 
indicated these debts were disputed. It further indicated the attorney was “prepared to 
file action on behalf of his client.” No actual dispute letters sent to the creditors were 
presented.19 The attorney’s letter contains general assertions without any discussion of 
supporting facts. It falls short of establishing that Applicant has a reasonable basis to 
dispute the legitimacy of any of these debts. Insufficient evidence has been presented 
to show that AG ¶ 20(e) applies to these debts.  
 
 Applicant receives credit for hiring an attorney and CPA to assist him with his 
financial problems and for the financial counseling he received from them. 
Nevertheless, his financial problems are ongoing and significant. From the evidence 
presented, I am unable to find that his delinquent debts are being resolved in a 
responsible manner. His financial problems continue to cast doubt on his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply.  
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable

19 AE AA contains a letter dated February 2, 2015, from the attorney to the collection company 
handling the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k. It is entitled “For Settlement Discussion Only.” It indicated that the 
collection company’s collection efforts give rise to claims under the Fair Debt Collection Act and other 
statutes. It does not set forth any specific legitimate basis for disputing that debt.

The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).  
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant has owned a business for 34 years. Over the years, his business was 
successful and grew. In the late 2000s, his business suffered during an economic 
downturn, and he incurred delinquent debts. In at least the past three years, his 
business rebounded. In 2012 and 2013, he reported significant personal income, but 
failed to take responsible action to address his delinquent debts. Many of the steps he 
took to address his debts occurred after his receipt of the SOR or after the hearing was 
held. The timing of his actions impacts the degree to which the mitigating conditions 
apply. Furthermore, the Appeal Board has recognized that some attempts to settle 
debts at reduced rates may weigh against an applicant in determining whether he or 
she acted in a responsible manner. In this regard, the Appeal Board stated: 
 
Applicant’s attempts to settle outstanding debts at a reduced amount 
speak directly to an evaluation of the good faith nature of Applicant’s effort 
to reduce indebtedness responsibly, given the record evidence of the fact 
that she had funds available to fully satisfy these debts, and the fact that 
Applicant’s attempts to settle the debt for lesser amount resulted in their 
going unpaid. Thus, Applicant’s attempts to settle the debts in the manner 
she did was an important aspect of the case affecting an evaluation in 
mitigation that warranted recognition and analysis on the part of the 
judge.20 
  
The same rationale applies here. Applicant failed to show that he has a legitimate basis 
for disputing the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.i, 1.k, and 1.l. Despite having the resources to 
resolve these debts, he set himself on a course over the past year to either settle or 
dispute them, but those efforts have resulted in little verifiable progress in resolving 
them. His apparent prolonged effort to settle these debts for lesser amounts undermines 
a finding that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. As stated above, his 
financial problems continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and 
good judgment.    
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all the above reasons, I 
conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate the financial security concerns.
