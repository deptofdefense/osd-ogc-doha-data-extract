<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On May 20, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline C (Foreign Preference), 
and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On 
ay 31, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant 
to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.<A HREF="04-08867.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge's unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline E is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to 
law.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, the Judge made sustainable findings that Applicant had omitted material information of security concern relating to his possession of a Lebanese 
passport from his response to question 15 of security clearance applications electronically submitted in January 2003, September 2003, and January 2004, and a 
security clearance application executed in October 2004.  The Judge also made sustainable findings that Applicant had omitted material information of security 
concern relating to his 1997 travel to Kuwait and Lebanon in response to question 16 of security clearance applications electronically submitted in January 
2003, September 2003, and January 2004.  The Judge concluded that Applicant's omissions did not rise to the level of deliberate falsifications under 
Disqualifying Condition 2,<A HREF="04-08867.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> because Applicant had relied in part on erroneous advice from his facility security officer (FSO) that he did not need to disclose 
the information concerning his Lebanese passport.  However, the Judge went on to conclude that Applicant had exercised questionable judgement in relying on 
the advice of his FSO, given the clear wording of question 15, and that Applicant's multiple omissions constituted poor judgement under the general security 
concern for Guideline E.  In that regard, the Judge's adverse conclusion was based upon an extensive analysis of Applicant's conduct under the "whole person" 
factors.<A HREF="04-08867.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  On appeal, Applicant contends the Judge's unfavorable clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law because Applicant's conduct 
did not fall under any of the Guideline E Disqualifying Conditions.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive. </P> 
 
<P>Although a Judge must apply pertinent disqualifying and mitigating conditions, the Judge is not required to do so in a rigid, mechanical manner.  Furthermore, 
because the conditions do not exhaust the realm of human experience or the kinds of conduct or circumstances that are pertinent to evaluating an applicant's 
security eligibility, the mere presence or absence of any particular disqualifying or mitigating condition is not dispositive of a case.  Finally, a Judge acts 
properly by evaluating an applicant's case under the "whole person" factors of the Directive.  <EM>See, e.g., </EM> ISCR Case No. 03-11448 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 
2004).  Accordingly, it was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to evaluate Applicant's security eligibility under the Guideline E's general 
concern, despite the Judge's conclusion that none of the Guideline's disqualifying conditions applied.</P> 
 
<P>A review of the decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and 
considered the possible application of relevant disqualifying, mitigating, or "whole person" factors.  The Judge found in favor of the Applicant with respect to 
most of the allegations.  However, the Judge articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying the relevant "whole person" factors under Guideline E, and 
reasonably explained why the evidence Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  Given the 
record that was before him, the Judge's unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline E is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</P>
