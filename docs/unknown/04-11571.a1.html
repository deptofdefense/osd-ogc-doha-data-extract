<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On August 11, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) 
of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 22,  2006, after the hearing, 
Administrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 
and E3.1.30.<A HREF="04-11571.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge's material findings are supported by substantial evidence; whether the Judge erred in taking 
administrative notice of Government Document XV-- the decision of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in the case of <EM>United 
States v. Kim</EM>, Criminal No. 97-117-A; whether the Judge erred by  concluding that the security concerns raised under Guideline B had not been mitigated.</P> 
 
<P>(1) Applicant argues generally that the Judge's findings of fact with respect SOR paragraphs 2.a through 2.d are not supported by substantial evidence.  
Applicant also specifically identifies two errors in the Judge's findings--that Applicant's stepfather is not employed by the U.S. government in South Korea, he 
is employed as a U.S. government contractor located there, and that in the text of the decision, the Judge mistakenly states that the allegation set forth in 
paragraph 2.b of the SOR, rather than paragraph 1.b, was resolved in Applicant's favor.  The Board does not find Applicant's argument persuasive.    </P> 
 
<P>The Board's review of a Judge's findings is limited to determining if they are supported by substantial evidence--such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind 
might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive &para; E3.1.32.1. "This is something less than the 
weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's finding from 
being supported by substantial evidence." <EM>Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm'n</EM>, 383 U.S. 607, 620, (1966).   The Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  
Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge's material findings with respect Applicant's circumstances of security concern reflect a plausible 
interpretation of the record evidence and are supported by substantial evidence.  They are therefore sustainable.   The two specific errors noted by the 
Applicant are harmless in that they did not materially affect the outcome of the case. </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>(2) Applicant contends that the Judge erred in taking administrative notice of Government Document XV--the decision of the United States District Court for 
the Eastern District of Virginia in the case of <EM>United States v. Kim</EM>, Criminal No. 97-117-A.  In support of that contention, Applicant argues that the document 
was irrelevant, in that it is "speculative, conjectural, and improperly prejudicial in nature."  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>In DOHA proceedings, the Federal Rules of evidence serve only as a guide.  They  may be relaxed by the Judge (with one exception not applicable to this 
appeal<A HREF="04-11571.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>) in order to permit the development of a full and complete record by the parties.  Directive &para; E3.1.19.  In this regard, the Board has previously noted 
that administrative or official notice in administrative proceedings is broader than judicial notice under the Federal Rules of Evidence.  <EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case 
No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) citing <EM>McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service,</EM> 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 (3d Cir. 1986).  By design, the 
DOHA process encourages Judges to err on the side of initially admitting evidence into the record, and then to consider a party's objections when deciding 
what, if any, weight to give to that evidence.    Because DOHA proceedings are conducted before impartial, professional fact-finders, there is less concern 
about the potential prejudicial effect of specific items of evidence than there is in judicial proceedings conducted before a lay jury.</P> 
 
<P>Citation to a court decision by the parties or the Judge is generally permissible.  However, it is important to remember that DOHA decisions are about the 
security suitability of the Applicant in the given case.  For that reason, Judges and parties are cautioned against reaching too far when they cite to the legal 
outcome of another person's case or the conduct of a person not before DOHA.  Moreover, court decisions evidencing a single, anecdotal, incident of 
espionage on behalf of a foreign country, are not particularly probative as to the overall political and intelligence profile of that country <EM>vis-a-vis</EM> the United 
States.  Therefore, such documents should be accorded considerably less weight than official executive branch documents and reports describing in broader 
terms the political and intelligence profile, or the human rights record, of a foreign country.</P> 
 
<P>After reviewing the document at issue, the Board concludes that the Judge reasonably acted within her discretion in taking administrative notice of it.  The 
document was an official document of the United States government.  The document was provided in advance to the Applicant as part of the discovery process 
of the case, so Applicant had an appropriate opportunity to rebut its contents, or present any alternative information for the Judge to notice.  It was only 
offered for the limited albeit marginally relevant purpose of providing background information as to the country involved.  In her findings of fact, the Judge 
specifically took notice of, and cited to, Government Documents I, V, VI, XII, and XIV, but did not specifically take notice of, or cite to, Government 
Document XV.  Nor did the Judge otherwise mention it in her decision, aside from the procedural references to it in her statement of the case.  Accordingly, 
based upon the record that is before us, it appears that the Judge appropriately gave Government Document XV little or no weight.   </P> 
 
<P>(3) Applicant argues that the evidence he provided in the proceeding below was sufficient to require the Judge to conclude, as a matter of law, that he had 
rebutted, mitigated or extenuated the security concerns raised by the Guideline B (Foreign Influence) allegations.  Specifically, Applicant contends that the 
Judge's adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge erred in not applying Guideline B Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="04-11571.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and made an unfavorable decision 
that is unsupported by the record as a whole.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, the Judge made sustainable findings that: (1) Applicant currently resides in South Korea, (2) Applicant's parents and grandparents, and his wife, 
his wife's parents, and his wife's five sisters are citizens and residents of South Korea, (3) Applicant is close to his mother and stepfather and speaks with them 
on a daily basis, (4) Applicant speaks with his grandparents by telephone two to three times a year, (5) Applicant provided financial support to help with his 
grandmothers medical expenses, (6) Applicant's wife receives health benefits from the South Korean government, (7) Applicant and his wife are close to his 
wife's parents and speak with them by telephone once every one or two weeks, and (8) "South Korea has been aggressive in seeking to acquire U.S. 
technology from U.S. companies and government contractors.  These aggressive tactics are reflected in the industrial espionage and economic information 
collection South Korea has carried out against U.S. companies, many of whom are U.S. government contractors."  Given those findings, the Judge concluded 
that Applicant's ties with his family members in South Korea raised security concerns under Guideline B and that Disqualifying Conditions 1, 2 and 6 applied.  
That conclusion shifted the burden of persuasion to Applicant.  If there are admitted or proven facts and circumstances that raise security concerns, "[t]he 
applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by 
Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision." Directive &para; E3.1.15.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge erred in not applying Guideline B Mitigating Conditions 1.  He also argues that the Judge gave insufficient 
weight to evidence that Applicant has renounced his South Korean citizenship, considers himself to be an American, and served honorably for four years in the 
United States Army.  Applicant's arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred.</P> 
 
<P>The application of Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them applies to the 
particular facts of a case.  Rather, the application of a disqualifying or mitigating condition requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record 
evidence as a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole 
and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  Applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the 
record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  </P> 
 
<P>Given the record in this case, it was reasonable for the Judge to conclude that Applicant had not met his burden of demonstrating that his family members were 
not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the Applicant to choose between loyalty to them and the U.S.<A HREF="04-11571.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  A review of the 
Judge's decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and 
considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.  The Judge articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying any 
mitigating conditions or factors and reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the 
government's security concerns.  The favorable factors cited by Applicant either do not readily suggest refutation, extenuation, or mitigation, or have low 
probative value.  The Judge was not required, as a matter of law, to favorably apply Guideline B Mitigating Conditions 1, and the Judge's overall adverse 
security clearance decision is sustainable.</P>
