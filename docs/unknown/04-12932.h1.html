<P>Applicant, a dual citizen of the United States and Iran, has failed to fulfill the requirements of the Memorandum from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and 
Intelligence, dated August 16, 2000, (Money Memorandum) by maintaining a current Iranian passport rather than relinquishing it to the proper Iranian authorities. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's immediate family 
members, including his mother and father, with whom he has close and continuing contact, and eight siblings or half-siblings, are citizens and residents of Iran. The evidence establishes that Applicant is 
vulnerable to foreign influence. </SPAN>Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On March 10, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>The SOR was based on Foreign Influence (Guideline B) concerns because of the foreign residency and citizenship of close family members and Foreign Preference (Guideline C) related to his exercise 
of dual citizenship with the United States and Iran by his retention and use of a foreign passport after he became a United States citizen. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant, acting <EM>pro se</EM>, filed a notarized response dated April 10, 2005, to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 25, 2005, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on August 22, 2005, and the 
hearing was held on August 29, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered 10 documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 through 10) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered two documentary exhibits (Exhibits A and B) and offered 
his testimony. The transcript (Tr) was received on September 14, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains six allegations, 1.a. through 1.f., under Guideline B and  two allegations, 2.a., and </SPAN>2.b.,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under Guideline C. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, except 2.b. The admissions 
are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make 
the following additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 50 year old employee of a defense contractor, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He is married and has three children.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He 
received BA, MA and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from United States universities.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was born in Iran in 1955 and immigrated to the United States in 1974. He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1989.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has immediate family members or people to whom he may be bound by affection or obligation who are not 
citizens of the United States, or may be subject to duress. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother and father are citizens </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and residents </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of Iran. He is close to them and usually speaks to them by telephone once a month. However, during the last few months, because his mother is 
ill, he calls them on a weekly basis.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has eight siblings, including half-sisters, five of whom are citizens </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and residents of</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Iran</SPAN>. Two of his brothers and one sister live in the United States, but they, like <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant,</SPAN> are dual citizens 
of Iran and the United States. All of his siblings, who live in the United States, go back and forth to Iran <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Tr at 54-57). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father owns a business and some property in Iran, which Applicant may be in line to inherit with his siblings, although the status of this property is not clear at this point </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Tr at 38- 40)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for another country over the United States.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> currently has an non-expired Iranian passport. His Iranian passport had expired in 2001, but he subsequently renewed it in 2003 and it is current until 2006. He has traveled to Iran to visit his 
family in the years 1997, 2000, and 2003, and he used his Iranian passport on all of these trips. Each of these trips was after he became a </SPAN>United States citizen<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. He testified that since he did not believe 
that he could  travel to Iran with a United States passport, he will continue to maintain his Iranian passport, as he </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">plans to travel to Iran </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and use his Iranian passport in the future (Tr at 41, 53-54). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testified that he does not consider himself a citizen of  Iran, but he conceded that he retained and used his Iranian passport because Iran considered him an Iranian citizen. He has never made 
an attempt to renounce his Iranian citizenship (Tr at 50-51). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, is to be taken into account in reaching a 
decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in 
making the overall common sense determination required. </P> 
 
<P>Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the 
individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the 
consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or 
conduct will continue or recur in the future. <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2. </P> 
 
<P>Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every 
case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a 
recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior. See Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.4. </P> 
 
<P>Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding that to do so is 
clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions 
which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Decisions 
under the Directive include consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets its burden and establishes conduct cognizable as a security 
concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where the facts proven by the Government raise 
doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States 
Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." 
Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security. <EM>See</EM> Enclosure 2 to the Directive, Section E2.2.2.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I conclude the following with respect to 
Guidelines B and C:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>(Guideline B - Foreign Influence)</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence or obligation, are not citizens 
of the United States or may be subject to duress. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established a reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of Foreign Influence concerns. 
As Applicant's mother and father, with whom he has a close personal relationship, and many siblings and half-siblings are citizens of Iran, a country which is undisputedly hostile to the Government of 
the United States, Applicant has a very heavy burden of showing that this family members do not pose a security risk. ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (October 16, 2002). Applicant has not met this 
substantial burden.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Based on the current status of Iran, the close ties that Applicant has, primarily with his parents, the existence of immediate family members, who are citizens and residents of Iran, creates the potential 
for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information, because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. It comes within </SPAN>Disqualifying 
Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1.  I conclude that the potential to inherit an interest in property in Iran is so tenuous that  DC E2.A2.1.2.8. does not apply.  No Mitigating Condition (MC) applies under 
Guideline B.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After considering all of the evidence of record on the issue of Foreign Influence, I conclude that the evidence supporting the SOR substantially outweighs any mitigating evidence.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>(Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>Guideline C is based on actions taken by an individual that indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States. Applicant's failure to relinquish his current Iranian passport to the proper 
Iranian authorities and his stated intention to continue to maintain the passport and use it in the future raises serious Foreign Preference (Guideline C) concerns. It is a violation of the Money 
emorandum, and therefore Applicant is absolutely barred from retaining a security clearance. Applicant's unwillingness to renounce his Iranian citizenship so that he can maintain his Iranian passport, 
must also be considered adversely to Applicant. </P> 
 
<P>DC E2.A3.1.2.1. applies because  Applicant's renewal and use of his Iranian passport after he became a United States citizen is a continuing example of Applicant's exercising dual citizenship. DC  
E2.A3.1.2.2. also applies because of Applicant's failure to return his passport to the proper authorities. No MC applies in this case under Guideline C.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Formal Findings as required by Section 3. Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 to the Directive are hereby rendered as follows:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Paragraph 1. Guideline B:  AGAINST THE APPLICANT</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.a.:  Against the Applicant</P>

<P>Subparagraph 2.b.:  Against the Applicant</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. </P>
