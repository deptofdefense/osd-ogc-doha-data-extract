<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June 15, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 30, 2006, after the 
hearing,  Administrative Judge Mary E. Henry granted Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the 
Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's conclusion that the security concerns raised by Applicant's 
history of indebtedness and excessive gambling had been mitigated is arbitrary and capricious.<A HREF="04-07360.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(1) Department Counsel contends that it was arbitrary and capricious for the Administrative Judge to conclude that the security concerns raised by Applicant's 
history of indebtedness were mitigated by application of Guideline F Mitigating Conditions 4<A HREF="04-07360.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and 6,<A HREF="04-07360.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and a "whole person" analysis.  In support of that 
contention, Department Counsel argues that: (a) not all of the debts have been paid off, (b) two of the four debts were satisfied by garnishment, and (c) what 
counseling Applicant received was for his depression and excessive gambling, not financial counseling.  Department Counsel's contention has some merit, but 
does not render the Judge's overall favorable decision arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The findings that Applicant had successfully mitigated the security concerns under Guideline F reflect permissible interpretations of the record evidence by the 
Administrative Judge.  The fact that Department Counsel can articulate a reasonable alternative interpretation is of no moment.  Department Counsel has not 
met her burden of demonstrating that the Judge's findings do not reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  Considering the record 
evidence as a whole, the Judge's findings about Applicant's history of indebtedness are sustainable.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Given the record evidence in this case, it was error for the Administrative Judge to fully apply  Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 4.  In this 
instance, Applicant did not complete any type of financial counseling and did not favorably complete the counseling for depression and excessive gambling.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As to Guideline F Mitigating Condition 6, it was error for the Administrative Judge to favorably apply that mitigating condition to the individual debts that had 
been satisfied by garnishment.  However, Applicant was not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he had paid-off every debt in its original full amount, 
and Department Counsel has not demonstrated it was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to give Applicant some credit for the mitigating 
evidence he produced under Guideline F Mitigating Condition 6, particularly when analyzing Applicant's financial circumstances in the overall context of his 
depression and gambling problem.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel is essentially arguing that the record evidence shows that Applicant was not as diligent about dealing with his financial problems as he 
could have been.  However, the unfavorable record evidence cited by Department Counsel is not sufficient to demonstrate the Administrative Judge's decision 
is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  As the trier of fact, the Judge had to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence 
outweighed the unfavorable evidence, or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice versa</EM>.  Department Counsel's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the record evidence is not sufficient to 
demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  In this case, Applicant had demonstrated that he had 
gotten his gambling problem substantially under control and that most of his indebtedness has been resolved.  The result had been a not insubstantial 
improvement to his financial situation.  Applicant is now alert to the security concerns presented by his circumstances and the responsibilities incumbent on 
him as a result.  The Board need not agree with the Judge's decision under Guideline F to conclude that it is sustainable.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(2) Department Counsel also contends that it was arbitrary and capricious for the Administrative Judge to conclude that the security concerns raised by 
Applicant's history of excessive gambling was mitigated by application of Guideline E Mitigating Condition 5<A HREF="04-07360.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and a "whole person" analysis.  In support of 
that contention, Department Counsel argues that: (a) Applicant did not complete his counseling and treatment programs for depression and excessive gambling, 
and (b) he did not completely discontinue gambling, but still does so in very small amounts. The Board does not find these arguments persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The findings that Applicant had successfully mitigated the security concerns under Guideline E reflect permissible interpretations of the record evidence by the 
Administrative Judge.  The fact that Department Counsel can articulate a reasonable alternative interpretation is of no moment.  Department Counsel has not 
met her burden of demonstrating that the Judge's findings do not reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  Considering the record 
evidence as a whole, the Judge's findings about Applicant's history of excessive gambling are sustainable.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel has not demonstrated it was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Administrative Judge to give Applicant some credit  under 
Guideline E Mitigating Condition 5 with respect to the mitigating evidence he produced.  Applicant was not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he 
had ceased to gamble.  The Judge's conclusion that Applicant's modest level of gambling no longer presented a security concern was not unreasonable, 
particularly when analyzed in the overall context of his personal and financial circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Again, Department Counsel is essentially arguing that the record evidence shows that Applicant was not as diligent about dealing with his depression and 
gambling problem as he could have been.  However, the unfavorable record evidence cited by Department Counsel is not sufficient to demonstrate the 
Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As the trier of fact, the Judge had to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide 
whether the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence, or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice versa</EM>.  Department Counsel's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the 
record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  In this case, 
Applicant had demonstrated that he had gotten his gambling problem substantially under control and that most of his indebtedness has been resolved.  The 
result had been positive changes in his life style and a not insubstantial improvement to his financial situation.  Applicant is now alert to the security concerns 
presented by his circumstances and the responsibilities incumbent on him as a result.  The Board need not agree with the Judge's decision under Guideline E to 
conclude that it is sustainable.   </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I agree with the opinion of my colleagues that the Administrative Judge correctly concluded (1) that Guideline E, Mitigating Condition 5<A HREF="04-07360.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> applied; (2) that 
Applicant's conduct was  mitigated under the whole person analysis; and (3) that the decision to grant Applicant's security clearance should be affirmed.  I 
respectfully disagree with my colleagues' comments that the Judge erroneously fully applied Guideline F, Mitigating Conditions 4<A HREF="04-07360.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> and 6.<A HREF="04-07360.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>I. The Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>A.  Findings of fact</STRONG>.  The Administrative Judge made the following material Findings of Fact (citations were deleted, and minor modifications made for 
purposes of brevity):</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 58-year-old financial analyst for a defense contractor.  He has worked for this contractor for more than twenty-four years.  He completed a 
security clearance application (SF 86) in December 2001. . . . He and his wife divorced in 1998.  He has two daughters and seven grandchildren.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As part of his divorce settlement in 1998, Applicant assumed responsibility for payment of $30,000 of credit card and other marital debt.  Subsequent to his 
divorce, he became depressed, started gambling, and isolated himself.  He incurred additional gambling debts totaling $20,000.  Thus, by 2001, Applicant had 
incurred debt totaling nearly $50,000.  By October 2003, he still owed about $15,000-$20,000, much of which has been paid. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleged that Applicant had five unpaid debts.  Two SOR debts were paid through garnishment of Applicant's pay, and another 
debt was resolved through a settlement.  The Judge found that four of five SOR debts were paid, and the unpaid SOR debt was for $1880.  At the time of the 
hearing, Applicant had not yet paid the $1880 debt because of holiday expenses.  He indicated an intent to pay this debt.  In light of his previous payments, his 
testimony is credible.  As of the hearing, he owed approximately $2,700 in debt, which included a credit card debt of $300 and a loan of $656 that were not 
listed on the SOR.  His net income is $3,030 a month, and his monthly expenses total $1,950.  Applicant has sufficient income to pay the remainder of his debt.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">At times, Applicant gambled most of his paycheck, reserving enough money to pay his rent.  At some point, he realized he could not continue to gamble.  He 
began going to church, and sought treatment/counseling with a mental health provider for his gambling problem and his depression.  His counseling began in 
2000 and continued until 2003. At one point, he and his therapist agreed on [] twelve sessions of treatment.  He did not complete these sessions. In March 2003, 
he met with another counselor once, but was not comfortable so he did not continue.  He also attended gamblers anonymous.  Throughout this time period, he 
continued to gamble.  In 2003, on two occasions, he signed a paper directing two different casinos to remove or arrest him if the casinos found him gambling in 
this establishments.  He has not gambled in the casinos since this time.  He has restructured his life. He plays racquetball and lift weights many evenings, 
instead of gambling.  He continues to attend church and is more interactive with his family.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Decision 2-5.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>B.  Discussion of findings of fact</STRONG>.  On appeal, Department Counsel does not challenge the Judge's findings of fact, but emphasizes that two SOR debts were 
paid involuntarily through a wage garnishment, and one SOR debt was settled for less than the full amount.  Applicant did not contact the creditor for the 
unpaid SOR debt for six months before his hearing, and two debts not listed on the SOR were past due by 60 days at the time of his hearing.  Applicant said he 
planned to pay his unpaid debts in March or April 2006.  Applicant continued to gamble after receiving counseling about gambling.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"There is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise."  ISCR Case 
No. 02-27133 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2005).  The appealing party's "disagreements with the Judge's findings, standing alone, are not sufficient to rebut that 
presumption."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Id</EM>.  The appealing party's ability to cite to record evidence and contendions that the Judge should have given greater weight to such evidence is 
not sufficient to overcome that rebuttable presumption.  ISCR Case No. 03-19006 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2005).  "Merely because a Judge does not give greater 
weight to record evidence cited by the appealing party, it does not follow that the Judge simply ignored that evidence."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Id</EM>.  The issue of the weight that the 
Judge gave the manner of payment of debts, the failure to pay a debt, and Applicant's continued gambling will be addressed in the discussion of the mitigating 
conditions and "whole person" analysis later in this decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>II. Whether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge's Conclusions on the Application of Specific Mitigating Conditions </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>A.  The Judge's material conclusions</STRONG>. The government has established a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie </EM>case to deny Applicant a security clearance because Applicant had a 
history of not meeting his financial obligations, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>see</EM> Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.1, and his financial problems are linked to gambling, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>see</EM> Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.5.  
The Judge noted, "Applicant began gambling after his divorce in 1998.  He incurred significant debt from his gambling in addition to the marital debt he had 
assumed as part of his divorce settlement.  He failed to pay much of his debt for a long period of time, and he still has some outstanding bills."  Decision at 8.  
The Judge also concluded that Applicant received counseling and there were clear indications that his financial problem is being resolved or is under control, 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.4 and that Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.6.  
The Judge explained her rationale for finding that Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions 4 and 6 were applicable stating:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Between his marital debts and his gambling, Applicant incurred nearly $50,000 of debt by 2001. By 2003, he had paid $30,000 to $35,000 of this debt, without 
filing for bankruptcy.  Some of the debt was paid following garnishment and the rest through his efforts.  By the time of the hearing, he owed $2,700.  $900 is 
new debt.  He has taken responsibility for his financial problems.  He developed a plan to pay his debt, and followed through.  At his current level of income, he 
can pay off his remaining debt.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A few years ago, he realized he was depressed and could not continue to gamble because of its negative effects on his life.  He initiated counseling to address 
the source of his depression.  During these sessions, he also discussed his gambling problem.  Although he developed a treatment plan with his therapist, he did 
not complete all the sessions.  He did attend ten sessions of gamblers anonymous.  However, neither the counseling nor gamblers anonymous successfully 
helped him overcome his issues with depression and gambling. Instead, he found that his faith provided him with the strength to manage his gambling problem 
and resolve his depression.  Without intervention by a court or other entity, Applicant took the initiative to take control of his gambling problem. He has stayed 
away from the casinos.  While he still gambles, he not only limits it to off-track betting on horse races, but he also significantly limits the amount of money he 
bets.  His gambling is no longer creating a financial problem as sho[wn] by his current debt level.  Decision at 8.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government established a prima facie case to deny Applicant a security clearance because Applicant's personal conduct increases his vulnerability to 
coercion, exploitation or duress, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>see</EM> Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.4.  The Judge stated, "Applicant developed a serious gambling problem after his divorce in 1998.  
Because of this problem, he ignored his bills and significantly increased his debt. His conduct left him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or duress."  Decision 
at 9.  The Judge concluded that Applicant has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>see</EM> 
Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.5.  The Judge articulated her rationale for finding that Mitigating Condition 5 was applicable stating:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">By paying off ninety-five per cent of his debt, Applicant has substantially eliminated his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress.  He has changed his 
after work life style to a much healthier one which includes exercise and more family time.  He continues to practice his faith which gives him the internal 
strength and emotional support he needs to control his gambling. It has also helped to resolve his problems with depression.  The fact that he has paid most of 
his large debt without filing bankruptcy shows he can manage his gambling desires.  In addition, by self-excluding himself with the casinos, he has made it 
more difficult to access casino gambling, the source of his large gambling debt.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Decision at 9.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>B. Discussion</STRONG>.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">An Administrative Judge is required to "examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for" the decision, "including a 'rational connection 
between the facts found and the choice made.'"  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.Co.</EM>, 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) 
(quoting </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States</EM>, 371 U.S. 156,168 (1962)).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge's decision to grant, 
deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive &para; E3.1.32.3.  Our scope of review under this standard is narrow 
and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the Judge.  We may not set aside an Judge's decision "that is rational, based on consideration of the relevant 
factors, and within the scope of the authority delegated to the [Judge] . . ." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n</EM>, 463 U.S. at 42.  We review matters of law </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>de novo</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The majority holds that the Judge's conclusions with respect to Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 4 were  arbitrary, capricious or unsupported by 
record evidence.  The majority declines to give Applicant full credit for counseling because it was not in connection with his financial problems under Financial 
Consideration Mitigating Condition 4.  To obtain more than partial application of this mitigating condition, counseling must be specifically oriented towards 
financial issues, such as credit or debt reduction.<A HREF="04-07360.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>   This mitigating condition, however, does not specify the type of counseling that is required.<A HREF="04-07360.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  The type, 
purpose, manner, intensity, quality and duration of counseling are all factors that should be left to the Judge to consider when applying Financial Considerations 
itigating Condition 4.  A Judge should have broad discretion in determining the weight to give counseling, and this discretion should not be disturbed when it 
reflects a reasonable, plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  The Judge's conclusions about the sources or origin of Applicant's financial problems 
(divorce, depression, and gambling), and the counseling's types (gambling and depression) and sources (church, therapist and gamblers anonymous), do not 
preclude her from concluding that this counseling met the requirements of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 4.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The majority opines that it is arbitrary, capricious or unlawful for the Judge to apply Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6 because two debts were 
paid by garnishing Applicant's salary.  Department Counsel also asserts one debt was settled, and three debts were overdue and not paid at the time of 
Applicant's hearing.  The Board has previously explained what constitutes a "good faith" effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant's debts.  The Directive does not define the term 'good-faith.'  
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith 'requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, 
and adherence to duty or obligation.'  Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(internal citation and footnote omitted).  ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 
2001).  The evidence was weak that  Applicant showed  "good faith" with respect to four creditors listed in the SOR.  Two SOR debts were paid through 
judgment and garnishment, and one SOR debt was paid through settlement.  The SOR  &para; 1.c. debt was never paid.  Moreover, at the time of his hearing, 
Applicant had not contacted the SOR &para; 1.c. creditor for six months, and had not tendered any payment for part or all of the $1,880 debt.  There was no record 
evidence showing Applicant acted reasonably, prudently, or that he adhered to his obligations with respect to these four SOR debts, or that he acted in good 
faith.  But an analysis that focuses on these four debts to the exclusion of other record evidence would be piecemeal, isolated consideration of the evidence, 
which is contrary to the Boards' requirement that application of a "mitigating condition requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>record evidence 
as a whole </EM>(emphasis added)."  ISCR Case No. 03-18254 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006). The Judge's findings accurately discussed the manner of Applicant's 
payment or nonpayment of the SOR debts.  Her conclusion of good faith, however, properly focused on Applicant's overall reduction of his $50,000 debt by 
95% from 2001 to January of 2006, his efforts to eliminate the underlying causes of those debts., and his promise to pay the remaining debt in the near future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel argued the evidence did not support application of Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 5 because Applicant continued to gamble, 
failed to complete treatment, and failed to follow treatment recommendations.  These factors showed Applicant failed to take the positive steps necessary to 
significantly reduce his vulnerability to exploitation.  The Judge explained how Applicant's gambling was under control-Applicant no longer went to casinos, 
and the magnitude of his betting on horse races was insignificant.  There is no security requirement for termination of all gambling.  Applicant's counseling was 
sufficiently effective to result in a 95% reduction in Applicant's debts.  The overall reduction in gambling and debt are the most important steps Applicant has 
taken to significantly reduce his vulnerability to exploitation-they outweigh the factors Department Counsel lists.  The Judge articulated a satisfactory 
explanation for her  application of Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 5.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Whether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge's Conclusions on the Application of  Mitigating Conditions to the Whole Person Analysis</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel argues that at the time of Applicant's hearing, he had multiple, unpaid, delinquent debts.  His gambling aggravated his financial problems,
