<P>Applicant was arrested and convicted in 2000 of two alcohol-related offenses.  In his March 2002 Security Clearance Application (SF 86), he deliberately 
falsified his answer to Question 24 (alcohol/drug offenses).  No mitigation has been adequately established.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">HISTORY OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On February 6, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and</P> 
 
<P>determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>On March 3, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made after a hearing by a DOHA Administrative 
Judge.  The matter was first assigned to another Administrative Judge, but was reassigned to me for resolution on June 17, 2004.  A Notice of Hearing was 
issued on July 1, 2004 setting the hearing for July 20, 2004.  At the hearing, the Government did not call any witnesses but submitted three documents, which 
were marked for identification as Government's Exhibits (GX) 1 - 3.  Applicant testified, but did not call any other  witnesses, and did not offer any exhibits.  
The transcript was received at DOHA on August 6, 2004. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 34-year-old technician for a defense contractor who is seeking a security clearance for Applicant in connection with his employment.  The SOR 
contains one allegation under  Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the facts of the 2000 arrest and conviction, but 
denies he had falsified the answer on his SF 86.  The admission is adopted as a Finding of Fact. </P> 
 
<P>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering the totality of the evidence in the case file, I make the following  additional FINDINGS OF FACT as to the SOR allegation:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct - Falsifications)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant falsified material facts on his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), signed on March 11, 2002, when he responded to the following question: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.(1) - <STRONG>2.  Your Police Record - Alcohol/Drug Arrests: </STRONG>. . . "Have you ever been charged with, or convicted of, any offenses relating to alcohol or drugs?", 
to which he answered "No"; whereas he deliberately failed to mention that he had been charged with and/or convicted, of an alcohol-related arrest; to wit, an 
arrest on April 29, 2000 in State A, for which he was charged with (1) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol Causing Injury, and (2) Driving With a 
easurable Blood Alcohol of .08% or more.  Applicant initially pleaded "Not Guilty" on June 1, 2000, but later pleaded "Guilty" to Count (2) on August 11, 
2000 and Count (1) was dismissed.  Imposition of sentence was suspended and Applicant was granted summary probation (unsupervised) for three  years, with 
specified conditions.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and 
maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; 
(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence 
(Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because each security case presents its own facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors cited above exhaust the realm of human 
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an 
unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable financial judgment 
and conduct.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related 
to the ultimate question of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  In reaching the fair and 
impartial overall common sense determination based on the "whole person" concept required by the Directive, the Administrative Judge is not permitted to 
speculate, but can only draw those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  In addition, as the trier of fact, 
the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified information is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted on to safeguard classified information and 
material twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an applicant for a security 
clearance, in his or her private life or connected to work, may be involved in conduct that demonstrates poor judgment, untrustworthiness, or unreliability.  
These concerns include consideration of the potential, as well as the actual, risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant's admission of the information in a specific allegation relieves the Government of having to prove that allegation.  If specific allegations and/or 
information are denied or otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the 
Statement of Reasons.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">If the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security concerns under the 
Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, 
despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or 
continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Government based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended,</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">at E2.2.2., "any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of national security will be resolved in favor of the 
nation's security."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E </STRONG>(Personal Conduct)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered Applicant's admissions as to the alleged falsification.  In his March 2004 response to the SOR, he states:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the fact that I checked "NO" on the line in question was due to a misunderstanding of the question on my part. I admit to the fact that I received a DUI on April 
29 ,2000 and have fulfilled all requirements imposed on me by the state.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He clearly admits the underlying offense (GX 2 and GX 3).  At the hearing, he expanded his explanation, which is fairly paraphrased as follows:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) He filled out the SF 86 "quickly" (Tr at 15, line 12).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) He "intended to go back through and double check everything" (Id., at lines 14, 15). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) He "was told to turn it in quickly and . . . failed to go back through and catch the error.  I should have checked "Yes."  I don't think there is, I really don't 
have any excuse for it.  Other than the fact that I had done it in an expedited manner, and we were in a hurry to get the Clearances to start the project at work. . . 
. That's all I have" (Id, at lines 15 - 21).     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Additional information was obtained during cross examination.  There was a rush by the company to get the clearance application submitted, "a matter of a day 
or two" (Tr at 23).  However, Applicant had time to speak with his wife to obtain information on where he had lived (Tr at 23, 24) and understood these 
questions and others (Tr at 24 - 26).  Applicant claims he wasn't concerned that admitting a DUI on his SF 86 might prevent him from obtaining a security 
clearance (Id. At 27).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is not clear what Applicant meant when he claimed a "misunderstanding" was the cause of the falsification. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Factually this is a relatively straightforward case.  Applicant was arrested and convicted on alcohol-related charges, as alleged in the SOR.  The court records 
contain evidence of Applicant's attendance at and completion of a court ordered counseling program, run by M.D.s and approved by the court (GX 3 at page 6).  
The sole issue to be decided is whether Applicant knew he should have answered "Yes" to Question 30.  I find his excuses and explanations to lack credibility 
and to be unpersuasive.  Among the reasons for this conclusion are the following:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">* It is too much of a coincidence that the two related questions: (24) - Alcohol/Drug Offenses)  and (30) Alcohol-related treatment) are the only ones of the SF 
86's 43 questions of which there is any evidence they were answered incorrectly.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">* There is no evidence of any nature supporting Applicant's claim that he erred because of haste or pressure from company officials.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">* The admonition at the end of the SF 86, immediately above where he signed his name, makes it clear that Applicant certified the correctness of all his 
answers.  He should not have signed the SF 86 unless and until he had verified the accuracy of his answers.  It was an act of extremely poor judgment on 
Applicant's part to act as he did. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">* His conduct clearly raises questions about his conduct in providing false answers on his SF 86.  Under the Directive, where there is a doubt as to a material 
point, that doubt must be resolved against the granting of a security clearance.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Disqualifying Condition 2 (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material fact from a security clearance application) is applicable, 
but none of the possible mitigating conditions have been established y the record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the totality of the evidence, I cannot conclude Applicant has demonstrated the integrity, good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of 
someone seeking access to the nation's secrets. </SPAN></P>
