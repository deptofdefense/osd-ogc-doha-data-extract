  Not every variance between Statement of Reasons and an Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions is fatal.  When applicant challenges such a variance on appeal, the Board must review the record as a whole to determine whether the  applicant (a) received fair notice of the issues being raised, (b) had a reasonable opportunity to litigate the issues raised, and (c) has  demonstrated he was harmed in a prejudicial manner.  As trier of fact, the Judge must draw reasonable inferences and reach  reasonable conclusions that take into account the totality of the record evidence.  Even a single criminal act may be sufficient to  raise security concerns.  Appealing party has heavy burden of overcoming rebuttable presumption that quasi-judicial officials are  impartial and unbiased.  Applicant's challenges to the Judge's impartiality and his findings and conclusions lack merit.  Adverse  decision affirmed.</P>

<P>Administrative Judge Wilford H. Ross issued a decision, dated October 5, 2000, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the reasons set forth
below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),
dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by making findings and reaching
conclusions that go beyond the matters alleged in the Statement of Reasons issued to Applicant; (2) whether the Administrative
Judge erred by making certain findings that are not supported by the record evidence; (3) whether the Administrative Judge erred
by finding a nexus between Applicant's conduct and his suitability for a security clearance; and (4) whether the Administrative
Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated February 2, 2000 to Applicant.  The SOR
was based on Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  A hearing was held on July 19, 2000.  The Administrative Judge issued a written
decision, dated October 5, 2000, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from the Judge's adverse decision.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by making findings and reaching conclusions that go beyond the matters alleged in the
Statement of Reasons issued to Applicant</SPAN>.  Applicant contends the Administrative Judge erred by making findings and reaching
conclusions that go beyond the two incidents alleged in the SOR.  Although Applicant's contention is not frivolous, it fails to
demonstrate the Judge erred.</P>

<P>An SOR must give an applicant adequate notice of the reasons why the government proposes to deny or revoke access to classified
information so that the applicant has a reasonably opportunity to respond to the SOR allegations and to present a defense to the
government's case against him or her.  <EM>See</EM> Executive Order 10865, Section 3; Directive, Section 4.3.  In considering the adequacy
of an SOR, it is important to note that an SOR is an administrative pleading, and such pleadings are not held to the stringent
standards of criminal indictments.<A HREF="99-0710.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Furthermore, administrative pleadings are not an end in themselves, but rather a means to
assist the disposition of a case on its merits rather than pleading niceties.<A HREF="99-0710.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Accordingly, as long as there is fair notice to the
affected party and the affected party has a reasonable opportunity to respond, a case should be adjudicated on the merits of relevant
issues and should not be concerned with pleading niceties.<A HREF="99-0710.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P>

<P>Applicant correctly notes that the Administrative Judge based his adverse decision on findings and conclusions concerning
incidents of physical altercation between Applicant and his wife that go beyond the two incidents alleged in the SOR.  In general,
an adverse security clearance decision cannot be based on uncharged conduct.<A HREF="99-0710.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  However, not every variance between an SOR
and a Judge's findings and conclusions is fatal.<A HREF="99-0710.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Indeed, technical defects in an SOR can be cured if the conduct of the
proceedings provide fair notice to the participants of the issues being litigated.<A HREF="99-0710.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  There is no simple formula by which to decide
when a variance between SOR allegations and the basis stated for the Administrative Judge's decision is harmful and when it is
not.<A HREF="99-0710.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  When an applicant challenges such a variance on appeal, the Board must review the case record  as a whole to determine
whether the applicant: (a) received fair notice of the issues being raised; (b) had a reasonable opportunity to litigate the issues
raised; and (c) has demonstrated he was harmed in a prejudicial manner.<A HREF="99-0710.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P>

<P>In this case, the SOR clearly placed Applicant on notice that the government was proposing to deny or revoke his access to
classified information based on concerns arising from his physical altercations with his wife.  The issue of Applicant's overall
history of conduct with his wife was clearly relevant to an assessment of the security significance of the two incidents alleged in
the SOR.  Furthermore, a review of the hearing transcript shows that Applicant was placed on adequate notice of the relevance of
his conduct beyond those two incidents and he was provided a full and fair opportunity to present evidence on the subject for
consideration by the Judge.  Finally, Applicant has not demonstrated how he was prejudiced in any meaningful way by the Judge's
actions.  In view of the foregoing, the Board concludes Applicant was accorded due process, and the Judge did not act in an
arbitrary and capricious manner by considering Applicant's conduct beyond the two incidents in the SOR and relying on his
findings and conclusions about that conduct to make his security clearance decision.</P>

<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by making certain findings that are not supported by the record evidence</SPAN>.  Applicant
contends the Administrative Judge erred by finding: (a) Applicant and his wife were mutually violent in violation of his probation;
(b) it is not credible for Applicant to claim that he never lost his temper, never raised his voice, and did not respond to his wife's
physical attacks except by restraining her with a soft bear hug; and (c) Applicant and his wife continued to fight within the last two
years.  Applicant contends the Judge's findings are not supported by the record evidence and fail to take into account the testimony
of Applicant and his wife.</P>

<P>Although the Board must give deference to the credibility determinations by an Administrative Judge (Directive, Additional
Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1), the deference owed to a Judge's credibility determinations does not immunize them from
review.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0435 (September 22, 2000) at p. 3.  Applicant clearly disagrees with the Judge's decision not
to accept at face value the testimony of Applicant and Applicant's wife.  However, the Judge was not required to accept at face
value the testimony of Applicant or Applicant's wife.<A HREF="99-0710.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Rather, the Judge had to assess the demeanor and credibility of the
witnesses and weigh their testimony in light of the record evidence as a whole.  Applicant's arguments fail to demonstrate the
Judge's credibility determinations are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P>As the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must draw reasonable inferences and reach reasonable conclusions that take into
account the totality of the record evidence.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0511 (December 19, 2000) at p. 13.  The Judge's findings
reflect a plausible interpretation of the record evidence in this case.  Applicant's ability to argue for an alternate interpretation of
the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge's findings are erroneous.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0435
(September 22, 2000) at p. 4; ISCR Case No. 98-0620 (June 22, 1999) at p. 3.</P>

<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding a nexus between Applicant's conduct and his suitability for a security
clearance</SPAN>.  Applicant contends the Administrative Judge erred by finding the record evidence established a nexus between
Applicant's conduct and his suitability for a security clearance.  In support of this contention, Applicant argues he engaged in only
an isolated criminal act and that such an isolated incident cannot support a conclusion that Applicant's access to classified
information should be denied or revoked.</P>

<P>The Board rejects Applicant's premise that a single criminal act would be insufficient to support an adverse security clearance
decision.  Even a single criminal act may be sufficient to raise security concerns.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying
Condition 2 (E2.A10.1.2.2.)("<EM>A single serious crime</EM> or multiple lesser offenses.")(emphasis added).  Applicant's premise fails to
take into account that although the frequency of conduct is a pertinent consideration (Directive, Item E2.2.1.3), the nature and
seriousness of the conduct (Directive, Item E2.2.1.1) and the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral
changes (Directive, Item E2.2.1.6) also must be considered.</P>

<P>The Board need not decide whether the February 1997 incident would be sufficient to justify the Administrative Judge's adverse
security clearance decision.  As discussed earlier in this decision, the Judge could consider the record evidence that Applicant had
multiple incidents of physical altercation with his wife in addition to the February 1997 incident.  Applicant's overall history of
physical altercations with his wife provides a rational basis for the Judge's adverse conclusions under Guideline J and his adverse
security clearance decision.</P>

<P>4. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN>.  Applicant also contends: (a) the
Administrative Judge's conclusions do not have a logical or reasonable basis in the record evidence; (b) the Judge reached adverse
conclusions about matters not alleged in the SOR; (c) the Judge unfairly prejudged him because of the tendency of people to
prejudge larger men when claims of spousal abuse are raised; and (d) the record evidence demonstrates many extenuating and
mitigating conditions that the Judge failed to take into account.  The Board construes these arguments as raising the issue of
whether the Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge's reached conclusions that are sustainable on the record evidence and that are not arbitrary, capricious,
or contrary to law.  Applicant's strong disagreement with the Judge's conclusions fails to demonstrate the Judge erred.</P>

<P>As discussed earlier in this decision, the Administrative Judge did not err by considering the record evidence of incidents of
physical altercation between Applicant and his wife that go beyond the two incidents alleged in the SOR.</P>

<P>There is a rebuttable presumption that quasi-judicial officials are impartial and unbiased.  <EM>See Schweiker v. McClure</EM>, 456 U.S. 188,
195 (1982).  The appealing party has a heavy burden when seeking to overcome or rebut that presumption.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case
No. 99-0007 (November 28, 2000) at p. 3; ISCR Case No. 97-0783 (August 7, 1998) at p. 2.  Applicant's theory about the Judge's
mental processes concerning spousal abuse cases falls short of rebutting the presumption that the Judge adjudicated Applicant's
case in a fair and impartial manner.  The issue is not whether the appealing party personally believes that the Administrative Judge
was biased.  Rather, the issue is whether the record of the proceedings below contains any indication that the Judge acted in a
manner that would lead a reasonable person to question the fairness or impartiality of the Judge.  Applicant fails to identify
anything in the record below that indicates or suggests a basis for a reasonable person to question the fairness or impartiality of the
Judge in this case.</P>

<P>Applicant's ability to refer to evidence favorable to him is not sufficient to demonstrate the Administrative Judge erred.  As the
trier of fact, the Judge had the responsibility of weighing the record evidence, both favorable and unfavorable, and decide whether
the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0044 (December 22,
2000) at p. 3.  Absent a showing that the Judge acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, the Board will not
disturb a Judge's weighing of the record evidence.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No.  00-0016 (October 23, 2000) at p. 3.  Applicant's
arguments fail to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  <EM>See</EM>
ISCR Case No. 98-0621 (November 23, 1999) at p. 4 ("An appealing party's disagreement with a Judge's weighing of the record
evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge erred.").</P>
