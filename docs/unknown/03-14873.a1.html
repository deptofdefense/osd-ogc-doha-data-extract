<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) proposed to deny or revoke access to automated information systems in ADP-I and ADP-II sensitivity 
positions for Applicant.  On November 18, 2004, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security 
concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided on the written record.  On March 23, 2006, after considering 
the record,  Administrative Judge Darlene Lokey Anderson denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.<A HREF="03-14873.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the 
Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's adverse clearance decision under Guidelines E and J is arbitrary, capricious 
or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge's adverse clearance decision should be reversed because the Applicant did not deliberately or intentionally make 
false statements in a  response to three questions on her Public Trust Position Application.  It is Applicant's contention that the omissions occurred because she 
had forgotten about the incidents in question and, in any event, she had subsequently provided correct information.  Applicant also argues that the Judge should 
have concluded that the security concerns<A HREF="03-14873.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> raised under Guidelines E and J had been mitigated, as a matter of law, because the disqualifying conduct was a 
series of isolated incidents, it is not recent, and the Applicant has since demonstrated rehabilitation.  The Board does not find Applicant's arguments persuasive. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's statements about her intent and state of mind when she executed the document in question were relevant evidence, but they were not binding on the 
Administrative Judge. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-19278 at 6-7 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 2003). As the trier of fact, the Judge had to consider Applicant's statements 
in light of the record evidence as a whole, and Applicant's denial of any intent to provide false information did not preclude the Judge from weighing the record 
evidence and making  findings that contradicted Applicant's denials.  The security concerns raised by Applicant's falsification were not necessarily mitigated 
by Applicant's subsequent disclosures to the government.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-19513 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2004).  Similarly, such concerns were not 
necessarily mitigated by Applicant's favorable professional and work record.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM>, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>e.g</EM>., ISCR Case No. 01-01642 at 6 (App. Bd. June 14, 2002).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the 
particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance 
decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice versa</EM>.  An applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not 
sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the 
possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors. The Judge found in Applicant's favor under Guideline F.  However, the Judge 
articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying any mitigating conditions or whole person factors with respect to the Guideline E and J allegations, and 
reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  
Given the record that was before her, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines E and J is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to 
law.</SPAN></P>
