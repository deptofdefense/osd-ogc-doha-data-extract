  Applicant's filing for bankruptcy did not bar the Administrative Judge from considering the negative security implications of Applicant's overall history of financial difficulties.  The Judge articulated a rational explanation for his conclusion that Applicant had not mitigated his financial difficulties  sufficiently to warrant a favorable decision.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated June 8, 2004, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  
Administrative Judge Joseph Testan issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated January 25, 2005.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>The issue raised on appeal is whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the reasons that follow, the Board 
affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN>  In his appeal, Applicant lists four points.  Two of these-the assertion 
that he has moved to a less-expensive apartment and the assertion that he learned after the hearing that he had already satisfied his debt to a state tax 
authority-constitute new evidence, which the Board cannot consider.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  </P> 
<P>On another point, Applicant ascribes error to the fact that the SOR states that Applicant owes eight debts, even though most of those debts have been discharged 
in bankruptcy.  The SOR was issued June 8, 2004.  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts, which were not discharged until August 2, 2004.  
Although most of the debts were discharged before Applicant's hearing, the Judge did not commit error in issuing formal findings against Applicant with regard 
to his overall debt, since Applicant's filing for bankruptcy did not bar the Judge from considering the negative security implications of Applicant's overall 
history of financial difficulties.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0621 (January 30, 2002) at p. 6.</P> 
<P>The final point raised by Applicant is that he is currently making installment payments to settle his debt to the IRS.  Applicant testified to that fact during the 
hearing.  (Transcript at pp. 28-31.)  There is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence in reaching his decision 
unless the Judge specifically states otherwise.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at p. 2.  Apart from that presumption, the Judge noted that 
Applicant was making installment payments to the IRS (Decision at p. 2).  Although the Judge concluded that Applicant qualified for Mitigating Condition 
E2.A6.1.3.6<A HREF="03-25086.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> because of his attempts to satisfy his IRS debt, the Judge articulated a rational basis for his conclusion that Applicant had not mitigated his 
financial difficulties sufficiently to warrant a favorable conclusion.  Applicant has not demonstrated error.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Board affirms the Administrative Judge's security decision because Applicant has failed to demonstrate error below.   </P>
