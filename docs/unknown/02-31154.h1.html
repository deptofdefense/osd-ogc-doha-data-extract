<P>Applicant is a 41-year-old naturalized citizen of the United States, working as an aerospace engineer for a defense contractor.  He was born in Taiwan and 
obtained his B.S. and M.S. degrees there.  He completed two years compulsory military service as an instructor at a military high school. He came to the U.S. in 
1989 to attend a prominent university, where he obtained his Ph.D.  He has worked for defense contractors since 1993, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 
2001.  Applicant renounced his Taiwanese citizenship, returned his passport, and eliminated most of his financial holdings in Taiwan.  His father, two brothers, 
and a sister-in-law live in Taiwan permanently, and his wife's parents live there part of each year.  His extensive personal, professional, and economic ties to 
the United States mitigate possible security concerns.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On December 12, 2001, Applicant submitted a security clearance application.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended 
and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and 
modified (the "Directive").  On January 28, 2004, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.  The SOR alleges security 
concerns raised under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and Guideline C, Foreign Preference, of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 24, 2004.  He elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. </P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on September 7, 2004.  With the concurrence of the parties, I conducted the hearing on October 20, 2004.  The government 
presented five exhibits.  Applicant's counsel introduced nine exhibits, the testimony of two witnesses, and Applicant's testimony on his own behalf.  DOHA 
received the transcript (Tr.) on October 28, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted the allegations, in part, and offered mitigating circumstances.  Answer to SOR, dated March 24, 2004.  <EM>Id.  </EM>Those admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is 41 years old.  Ex. 1 at 1.  He was born in Taiwan (The Republic of China) and grew up in that country.  <EM>Id.</EM>  He attended a university in Taiwan and

<P>In Executive Order 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM>, &sect; 3.1(b) (August 4, 1995), the President provided that eligibility for access to classified 
information shall be granted only to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength 
of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, 
and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  A person granted access to classified 
information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those 
individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of 
the applicant.  Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a 
clearance.</P> 
<P>To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in 
this case are: </P> 
<P>Guideline <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">B, Foreign Influence:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, or other persons to whom he may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries 
are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline C, Foreign Preference:  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she 
may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  Directive, &para; E2.A3.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, 
reliable information about the person. <EM> Id.</EM>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age 
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
<EM>Id.</EM>  <BR> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.  Directive, &para; E3.1.14.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  Directive, &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent 
with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive, &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline C, Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets out circumstances that could indicate a disqualifying foreign preference.  Directive, &para; E2.A3.1.2.  Under &para; E2.A3.1.2.1, "[t]he exercise of 
dual citizenship" may be disqualifying.  Applicant became a citizen of the United States in May 2001, but did not formally renounce his Taiwanese citizenship 
until 2004.  There is no evidence, however, indicating that Applicant exercised his rights of dual citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen, such as using his 
Taiwanese passport or voting in an election in Taiwan.  I find this potentially disqualifying condition does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A3.1.2.2 of the Directive indicates that the "[p]ossession and/or use of a foreign passport" may show a potentially disqualifying foreign 
preference.  In this case, Applicant possessed his Taiwanese passport after becoming a U.S. citizen, even though he did not use it.  I find that this potentially 
disqualifying condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive also provides that "military service" for a foreign country may raise security issues.  Directive, &para; E2.A3.1.2.3.  Here, Applicant was a second 
lieutenant for two years, as part of Taiwan's compulsory service requirement.  This raises the possibility of security concerns.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive also sets out conditions that could mitigate security concerns related to foreign preference.  Under &para; E2.A3.1.3.1, it may be mitigating where 
"[d]ual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country."  Applicant became a citizen of Taiwan because of his birth in that 
country.  I conclude this potentially mitigating condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A3.1.3.2 of the Directive, it may be mitigating where "[i]ndicators of possible foreign preference (e.g., foreign military service) occurred before 
obtaining United States citizenship."  Applicant's military service in Taiwan occurred before he became a U.S. citizen.  The service was required by the law of 
Taiwan, it was relatively brief, and it did not involve intelligence gathering functions.  I find this mitigating condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It may also be mitigating where the activity in question is "sanctioned by the United States."  Directive, &para; E2.A3.1.3.3.  The law of the United States does not 
prohibit a U.S. citizen from holding a foreign passport; however, recognizing that it is lawful is not the same as sanctioning the practice.  Here, the United 
States did not direct, request, or require Applicant to keep his foreign passport.  I conclude this mitigating condition does not apply.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, it may be mitigating where an "[i]ndividual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship."  Applicant renounced his Taiwanese citizenship 
unequivocally and returned his passport to that country.  Ex. A.  Moreover, he has chosen to live in the United States for the greater part of his adult life, his 
wife and son are U.S. citizens, he and his wife have risen to positions of responsibility in their career fields, and he has most of his financial assets here.  I 
conclude this mitigating condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I carefully considered all the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the "whole person"concept.  I conclude that Applicant has mitigated 
the security concerns arising from his possession of a foreign passport.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B, Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A2.1.2.1 of the Directive provides that it may be a disqualifying condition if "an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual 
has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country<EM>.</EM>"  Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1. defines "immediate family 
members" to include a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.  Applicant has immediate family members-his  father and two 
brothers-who are citizens and residents of Taiwan.  Additionally, Applicant's mother-in-law, father-in-law, and sister-in law are persons with whom he has 
close bonds of affection.  Applicant maintains regular contact with his father, his younger brother, his mother-in-law and his father-in-law. <STRONG> </STRONG>These 
circumstances "could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information."  Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While 
the </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mere possession of family ties with persons in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, automatically disqualifying . . . [it] does raise a prima facie security 
concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for the applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 at **33-34 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  I conclude this potentially disqualifying condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Similarly, it may be disqualifying where an applicant "shar[es] living quarters with a person  . . . if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists."  
Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.2.2.  As noted above, Applicant's mother-in-law lives with Applicant's family for a portion of each year.  She is a retired high school 
teacher, with no continuing connection to the Taiwanese government other than her pension.  She is a citizen of Taiwan, but holds a "green card" allowing her 
to reside in the U.S.  The fact that Applicant's mother-in-law resides in the U.S. for a substantial part of each year greatly reduces the possibility a foreign 
power could improperly influence or exert pressure upon her.  However, Applicant's mother-in-law has a daughter who is also a citizen and resident of Taiwan.  
Under the circumstances, I find this potentially disqualifying condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A2.1.2.3 of the Directive, it may be disqualifying where, "[r]elatives . . . are connected with any foreign government."  One of Applicant's brothers 
works for a private company that performs contract work for the government of Taiwan.  Applicant's mother-in-law receives a retirement as a former school 
teacher.  I am not persuaded that this relationship is sufficient to constitute a "connection" to a foreign government.  I find this potentially disqualifying 
condition does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A2.1.2.8 of the Directive provides that a "substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign-owned or -operated business that could 
make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence," may be disqualifying.  Applicant derives no regular income from his real estate holdings, he does not 
participate in the management of the property, and he cannot liquidate the asset at present.  Nonetheless, considering its value, I find Applicant's real estate 
holding in Taiwan is a substantial financial interest.  I conclude this potentially disqualifying condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the Directive, the security concerns arising from possible foreign influence may be mitigated under certain circumstances.  These security concerns may 
not be disqaulifying where it is determined that "the immediate family members . . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a 
foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United States."  Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.3.1.  None 
of Applicant's relatives are employees or officers of the government.  There is no evidence indicating any one of them is an "agent of a foreign power."  <EM>See</EM> 50 
U.S.C.A. &sect; 1801(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In assessing whether an applicant is vulnerable to exploitation through relatives in a foreign country, it is helpful to consider several factors, including the 
character of the government of the relevant foreign country.  Taiwan is a democracy and an ally of the United States.  The two countries are joined in economic 
and security agreements.  Taiwanese businesses and individuals have a history of engaging in economic and industrial espionage.  However, there is no 
evidence indicating that the government of Taiwan, or any other entity meting the definition of a "foreign power," sponsored or encouraged efforts to exploit 
citizens or residents of Taiwan for that purpose.  Under the circumstances, the possibility that a "foreign power" would attempt to exploit or pressure 
Applicant's relatives in Taiwan to force Applicant to act adversely to the interests of the United States is limited.<EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is important to consider the vulnerability to duress of Applicant's relatives in Taiwan.  As noted above, Applicant's relatives in Taiwan are not and have 
never been employees of the Taiwanese government.  His father is retired from a private company, and does not draw a government pension.  Applicant's father 
and brothers have the educational backgrounds and job skills to be financially secure and independent.  Applicant's mother-in-law and father-in-law are retired 
and reside in the United States during a substantial portion of each year, minimizing their vulnerability.  Applicant's sister-in-law operates a private business.  
Under these circumstances, Applicant's relatives in Taiwan are not especially vulnerable to adverse influence by a "foreign power." <EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Another significant factor is Applicant's vulnerability to pressure or duress applied indirectly through his ties with his relatives.  Applicant maintains regular 
contact with his father, his younger brother, his mother-in-law and his father-in-law.  I find he is bound by close ties of obligation and affection to his relatives 
in Taiwan.  At the same time, he has extensive ties to the United States.  Applicant has now lived here most of his adult life, his spouse and child are citizens 
and residents of the U.S., his professional standing is with U.S. firms, and most of his financial interests are in the United States.  He has worked for defense 
contractors for many years and was previously granted access to controlled material without adverse incident.  Considering the extent of his ties to the United 
States, I find Applicant is not vulnerable to pressure or duress through his relatives in Taiwan.  I conclude the mitigating condition set out in &para; E2.A2.1.3.1 of 
the Directive applies.<STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A2.1.3.3 of the Directive, it may also be mitigating where "[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent."  
Applicant maintains regular contact with his father, his younger brother, and his mother-in law.  Thus, this mitigating condition does not apply to his 
relationships with them.  Applicant has not seen his older brother or his sister-in-law in Taiwan for several years, and does not maintain regular contact.  I 
conclude this mitigating condition applies to those relatives.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.5 of the Directive provides that security concerns arising from the ownership of property in a foreign country may be mitigated where the 
"[f]oreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities."  Applicant's undivided interest in several units of 
an apartment complex represents a fraction of his net worth.  He has no control over the management of the property, nor does he receive any proceeds.  I find 
this financial interest is not sufficient to affect Applicant's security responsibilities.  However, the value of the property is not minimal.  Therefore, I conclude 
this mitigating condition does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts and circumstances in this case in light of the "whole person" concept.  Applicant is a mature individual who has spent the 
majority of his adult life in the United States.  The personal, professional, and economic ties that bind him to the United States far outweigh his connections 
with relatives and property in Taiwan.  I conclude Applicant has mitigated any potential security concerns arising from Applicant's family ties and financial 
interests in Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
