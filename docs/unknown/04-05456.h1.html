<P>Applicant engaged in criminal conduct on at least eight separate occasions, from 1991 to 2001.  His long history of alcohol abuse has resulted in much of this criminal conduct. Applicant received 
alcohol abuse treatment from two facilities, but he was not ultimately successful because he did not complete either of the programs, and he has continued consuming alcohol. Mitigation has not

<P>On <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">September</SPAN> 28, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or granted.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant<EM></EM> filed a notarized response dated <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">November</SPAN> 11<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2005</SPAN>, to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. On January<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 28, 2005</SPAN>, the case 
was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing. Pursuant to formal notice dated January 11, 2006, a hearing was held on February<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 14</SPAN>, 2006.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered 19 documentary exhibits (Government's Exhibits 1-19) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered no documentary exhibits (Applicant's Exhibits 
A-D) and offered his own testimony.  The transcript (Tr) was received on </SPAN>March<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 1, 2006.</SPAN></P>

2. Through 2.d., under Guideline G. Applicant admits SOR allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.h., 1.i., 1.k., 1.l., 1.m., 1.n., 1.o., 2.c., and 2.d..  The admitted allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> denied that allegations 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., and 1.o., as discussed above, were applicable to him. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> has been aware of these allegations since he spoke to an agent of the 
Defense Security Service in January 28, 2004, and he indicated at that time that he would attempt to contact the proper police departments and a public defender to resolve these incorrect 
allegations. At the hearing, he was unable to introduce any evidence to show that these allegations did not involve him.  He also testified that these criminal acts may have been committed by his 
nephew, because he had his driver's license number.  However, he conceded that his nephew never actually had <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN> driver's license, and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> was in his forties while his nephew  was 
in his teens, during these events. As a result, I do not find <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">credible Applicant's</SPAN> explanation that he was not involved.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> also testified that he never completed a court ordered alcohol treatment program.     <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E (Alcohol Consumption) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses alcohol to excess.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>a.   Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from</P> 
 
<P>approximately 1985. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> continues to consume alcohol.</P> 
 
<P>         </P> 
 
<P>          b.   That  information  as  set  forth  in  subparagraphs  l.a., l.c., 1.e., l.f., l.h., l.i., and 1.m. </P> 
 
<P>above.</P> 
 
<P>         </P> 
 
<P>c.   Applicant attended an alcohol education school in about August 1991. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> did not complete his attendance at that program. </P> 
 
<P>        </P> 
 
<P>d.   Applicant attended alcohol counseling from August 2, 1999 to January 24, 2000 and from September 20, 2001 to March 6, 2002.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant</SPAN> also did not complete his attendance at that program.   
  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant went through a treatment program in 1991, which advised him to abstain from alcohol consumption, but he drank after attending the program. He attended a second program in 1999, but 
he has never completed that program. Until the hearing, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> consumed alcohol and had no intention to stop consuming alcohol in the future. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">At the hearing </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> testified that, based on the questions asked of him by </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel, he now realizes that alcohol consumption can cause problems, and he now intends to abstain 
from imbibing in the future. The fact that Applicant  has served approximately two years in prison, by his own admission, as a result of his alcohol-related convictions, and he only now decided to 
stop consuming alcohol makes his stated intention less than credible.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">I find that it is far too soon to conclude that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> will be able to abstain from alcohol in the future. </SPAN>    </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN> considered<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the overall common sense determination 
required. </SPAN>The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this 
policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether 
a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable 
participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to establish 
his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of 
such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </P> 
 
<P>the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has 
a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following:</SPAN> </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government has established by substantial evidence that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's conduct, which occurred </SPAN>from 1991 until 2001<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and which is the basis for allegations 1.a. through 1.o. of the SOR,  </SPAN>is 
criminal.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J,  I conclude that Disqualifying Conditions (DC) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">(E2.A10.1.2.1.), </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged; and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">(E2.A10.1.2.2.)</SPAN>, a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">apply because Applicant's conduct did involve eight serious criminal offenses over a period of at least 10 years. Applicant failed 
to offer any significant evidence to rebut the Government's case regarding his criminal conduct. </SPAN>During the hearing, Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> gave</SPAN> inconsistent and sometimes contradictory explanations of how 
these events occurred. I find that his entire testimony was less than credible.  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While an argument may be made that the criminal behavior was not recent, I find that based on the history and seriousness of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">'s conduct, it is too soon to make that finding, and therefore, 
no Mitigating Condition (MC) applies. I resolve Guideline J against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>(Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption)</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has had a long history of consuming alcohol to excess. He has had seven alcohol related arrests from 1991 until at least 2000. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government established, by substantial evidence, that Applicant was involved in alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence, which is Disqualifying 
Condition (DC) (E2.A7.1.2.1.). </SPAN>It has also been established <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">by substantial evidence that Applicant  has engaged in habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment which 
is which is DC </SPAN>(E2.A7.1.2.5.). </P> 
 
<P>MC (E2.A7.1.3.2.) could be argued to apply, because <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> has not been arrested for an alcohol related incident since 2000. However, since he has had a long history of consuming alcohol and 
then becoming involved in alcohol-related incidents, and he has continued to consume alcohol until the time of the hearing, I find that this MC does not yet apply.  I also do not find that any other 
C applies to this <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN>.  Guideline G is concluded against Applicant.</P>
