<P>Applicant was twice convicted of drinking driving related offenses in 1984 and 1997. Part of the sentence following his second conviction required him to 
attend an outpatient alcohol treatment program, which he did  from November 1998 to April 1999.  He stopped drinking for six to eight months after 
completing this program and began drinking again.  In June 2003, he self-referred to an intensive outpatient alcohol treatment program and has been alcohol 
free for one year.  Additionally, he has held a top secret clearance for 25 years while making substantial and significant contributions to the defense industry.  
He has successfully mitigated security concerns pertaining to past alcohol consumption.  Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On November 18, 2003, DOHA issued 
a Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-16274.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive.  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on December 8, 2003, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 25, 2004, the case was assigned to me.  On March 15, 2004, Counsel for Applicant entered a notice of appearance.  On March 31, 2004, DOHA 
issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case for April 30, 2004.  The hearing was conducted as scheduled to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government offered seven documents, which were admitted without objection as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7.  The Applicant offered two 
documents, which were admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B.  DOHA received the transcript on May 11, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein.  In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make 
the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 50-year-old unmarried man, and has on occasion supported a woman with which he has had a long-standing relationship.  He has no dependents.  
He suffers from the latent effects of poliomyelitis, which he contracted at 1 &frac12; years of age.  He has flaccid paralysis of his right leg and residual weakness in his 
left leg and walks with the assistance of crutches.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since 1980, Applicant has been employed as an engineer in the defense industry.  He has been with his current employer since June 1996.  Since 1980, he has 
continuously held a top secret clearance without incident, a period of approximately 25 years.  He holds a bachelor of science degree with a major in physics, 
and master of science degree in theoretical astrophysics.  He was recently inducted into a highly competitive technical fellowship program within his company 
as an associate technical fellow.  He has also published several highly technical and recognized papers in his area of specialization.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant consumed alcohol from approximately 1978 until at least April 2003, SOR &para; 1.a.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 25, 1984, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence.  He was found guilty, fined, and his driver's license was suspended for six months, 
SOR &para; 1.b.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 17, 1998, Applicant was found guilty of driving while impaired following his arrest on December 6, 1997.  His driver's license was suspended for 
six months, was awarded fines totaling $505.00, loss of driving privileges for six months, and was required to attend 12 hours at Intoxicated Driver Resource 
Center, SOR &para; 1.c.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant attended outpatient treatment at an alcohol treatment center from November 2, 1998 to April 26, 1999, SOR &para; 1.e.  He was referred to this program 
by the Intoxicated Driver Resource Center, see above.  His initial diagnosis was DSM 305.0, Alcohol Abuse.  Applicant had a satisfactory attendance record, a 
satisfactory participation level and kept an overall satisfactory attitude while in treatment.  He also attended the required Alcoholics Anonymous meetings as 
part of treatment.  His discharge diagnosis was DSM 305.0, Alcohol Abuse/Partial Remission.  GE 3.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant ceased consuming alcohol for six to eight months after he completed this program.  He had hoped among other things that if he stopped drinking, his 
post-polio symptomolgy would improve, but it did not.  GE 5.  Applicant then resumed his "normal after-work habit of having several drinks . . . after dinner."  
Tr. 25.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 18, 2003, Applicant self-admitted to the same alcohol treatment center he previously attended from 1998 to 1999.  His initial diagnosis was DSM 
303.90, Alcohol Dependence.  This diagnosis was not performed by a credentialed medical professional, which was conceded by the government.  Applicant 
successfully completed an intensive outpatient program and afterwards completed relapse prevention and continued care programs.  He attended follow-up 
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and worked with his sponsor utilizing the 12-step program.  He was discharged on February 17, 2004, and his discharge 
diagnosis was DSM 303.93, Alcohol Dependence in Remission.  AE A.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has not had a drink since once week before he entered the program, which was June 18, 2003.  Tr. 25-26.  At the time of his hearing, he had 
completed six weeks short of a year of total sobriety.  Tr. 36.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the conclusion of the evidentiary portion of the hearing, the government stated that SOR &para;&para; 1.d. and 1.f. had been mitigated to their satisfaction.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a highly valued, trusted and experienced employee.  He is viewed by his superior as being responsible, trustworthy and possessing integrity.   He 
has a distinguished record of 25 years of significant contributions to the defense industry and national defense.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead they are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, administrative judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive.  The government has the burden of proving any 
controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts must have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance 
is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." As 
Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for 
access to classified information to "United States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for 
coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Executive Order 12968, 
<EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines 
contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, then the applicant has the ultimate burden of establishing his security suitability with substantial evidence in 
explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  <EM>See </EM>Executive Orders 10865 &sect; 2 and 12968 &sect; 3.1(b). 
"Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." 
Directive &para; E2.2.2 "The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM> See Egan</EM>, 
484 U.S. at 531.  Doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant consumed alcohol from approximately 1978 until at least 2003, that he had two drinking driving related offenses in 1984 
and 1997, was arrested for driving on a suspended license in 1998, attended outpatient treatment at an alcohol treatment center from November 1998 to April 
1999, the same alcohol treatment center following an evaluation of alcohol dependence recommended Applicant attend an outpatient program, and that despite 
this evaluation, Applicant continued to consume alcohol  (&para;&para; 1.a. through 1.g).  <EM>The Concern: </EM>Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of 
questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. 
Directive &para; E2.A7.1.1.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established its case  under Guideline G by Applicant's admissions and evidence submitted as to &para;&para; 1.a. through 1.f.  However, Applicant 
denied &para; 1.g.  He further supported his denial by unrebutted evidence.  Additionally, the government stated upon the conclusion of the evidence that Applicant 
had mitigated &para;&para; 1.d. and 1.f.  I concur with this assessment.  The remaining allegations, however, give rise to Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition 
(AC DC) E2.A7.1.2.1. <EM>(Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, . . .).</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The remaining evidence establishes Applicant had a drinking driving offense in March 1984, approximately 20 years ago, a drinking driving offense in 
December 1997, approximately seven years ago, and that as a result of the 1997 drinking driving offense, he was required to attend an outpatient alcohol 
treatment program, which he did from November 1998 to April 1999.  Following completion of that program, he stopped drinking for approximately six to 
eight months and then resumed drinking.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In June 2004, Applicant self-admitted to the same alcohol treatment center where he was treated from 1998 to 1999.  Although diagnosed as alcohol dependent 
during intake, such diagnosis was not completed by a credentialed medical professional as defined by the Directive &para; E2.A7.1.2.3.  In February 2004, he 
completed the program and fully complied with all requirements of the program.  At the time of the hearing, he had been alcohol-free for almost one year.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's two drinking driving offenses give rise for concern, however, they occurred  20 and seven years ago, respectively. To Applicant's credit and highly 
commendable on his part, he self-referred to an alcohol treatment center.  Since seeking help, he has done everything within his means to modify his lifestyle 
and engage in behavior supportive of sobriety.        </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These facts trigger Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions (AC MC) E2.A7.1.3.2. <EM>(The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no 
indication of a recent problem); </EM>and AC MC E2.A7.1.3.3 <EM>(Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety).  </EM>Applicant was able to recover from a series of 
rather unfortunate events that would have been difficult for most individuals to overcome. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a demonstrated track record of 25 years of outstanding service as an engineer employed by the defense industry, who has made countless 
contributions to the national defense.  During those 25 years, he has held a top secret clearance.  I found his testimony credible and found his self-referral for 
outpatient treatment commendable.  Furthermore, he has successfully overcome the life-long permanent disability he sustained after contracting polio as a 
young child.      </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the totality of the circumstances to include his documented actions coupled with his credible testimony, I find for Applicant on SOR &para; 1.</SPAN></P>
