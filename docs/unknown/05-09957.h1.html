<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Twenty-eight-year-old Applicant was involved in criminal conduct in 1997, 2001, and 2003.  The most serious offenses were in 2001, when he illegally accessed a former employer's computer system, 
and damaged that system, and in 2003, when he made two false statements on his security clearance application.  </SPAN>He failed to mitigate security concerns pertaining to his criminal conduct, personal

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On November 5, 2003, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security Clearance Application <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SF 86).<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN> On February 17, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The SOR alleges security 
concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct), E (Personal Conduct), and M (Misuse of Information Technology Systems).  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In an answer notarized on April 3, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  A complete copy of the file of 
relevant material (FORM), dated August 4, 2006, was provided to him on August 11, 2006, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Any such submissions were due by September 10, 2006, but he did not submit any additional information.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The case was assigned to me on October 12, 2006.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations, Applicant admitted the conduct alleged in the SOR, however, for each SOR allegation he cited possible mitigating circumstances that could reduce security concerns.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  His 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  With respect to SOR &para;&para; 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c, he contends the conduct was not recent and his criminal records were expunged.  For SOR &para; 1.d, the 
conduct was not recent, and he had changed.  For SOR &para;&para; 1.e, 2.a, and 2.b, he voluntarily disclosed that he provided inaccurate information on his SF 86.  In regard to SOR &para; 3.a, which alleges the 
underlying conduct of the criminal conviction alleged in SOR &para; 1.a, he explained some of the circumstances surrounding his guilty plea to Computer Illegal Access. However, his response to SOR &para; 1.a 
contained misleading information about his responsibility for the malicious use of his computer application and his culpability in regard to this offense.  This finding is addressed in greater detail in the 
Findings of Fact, <EM>infra</EM> at 5-6.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 28-years-old.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  He is employed as a software engineer for a defense contractor.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  From 1996 to 2004, he attended college or a university, and was awarded a Master of Science degree.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  
Applicant has no prior military service.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant was married on May 23, 2001.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&para;&para; 1.a to 1.d, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">lists four occasions where Applicant was either arrested and/or charged with various violations of state law between 1997 and 2001.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> SOR </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&para; 1.e alleges that he violated 18 U.S.C. &sect; 
1001 by falsifying two answers on his 2003 SF 86. As indicated previously, he admitted the allegations in SOR &para; 1.a - 1.d, which lists various charges and some disposition information, but does not 
detail the underlying circumstances of the conduct.  In regard to SOR &para; 1.a , the investigative report and court records are Items 7 to 9, and provide detailed information about Applicant's conduct.   
Because SOR &para; 1.e alleges the same conduct as in SOR &para;&para; 2.a and 2.b, but as a  violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001, SOR &para; 1.e will be addressed in the Personal Conduct section, <EM>infra</EM>.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 10, 1997, Applicant was charged with Dishonesty, Theft, Vandalism, and Failure to Comply (SOR &para; 1.d). He was fined $50.00, assigned to alcohol education, and relocated to another 
residence on campus.  He received probation before judgment and his criminal record was subsequently expunged.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 13, 1998, he was arrested for 3<SUP>rd</SUP> Degree Burglary, 2<SUP>nd</SUP> Degree Assault, Giving a False Fire Alarm, Malicious Destruction of Property and Petty Theft (SOR &para; 1.c).  Applicant states the 
entire incident was a big misunderstanding, and it was placed on the "stet" docket.  This conviction was subsequently expunged.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 11, 2000, he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) (SOR &para; 1.b). On November 17, 2000, he received probation before judgment, and his driver's license was 
suspended for 45 days.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 20, 2001, he was arrested for Computer/Illegal Access/Damage (SOR &para; 1.a).  On March 22, 2001, he pleaded guilty to Computer Illegal Access.  The court sentenced him to 80 hours of 
community service, probation for 12 months, a fine and court costs of $250.00, and restitution of $5,187.00.  He was also required to receive psychological counseling.  On June 23, 2005, the court 
issued an order expunging the police and court records concerning this incident.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  The facts pertaining to this offense are discussed at pages 5-6, <EM>infra</EM>.     <STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence of record establishes Applicant's knowing and deliberate falsification as alleged in SOR &para;&para; 2.a and 2.b of Questions 6 and 26, respectively of Applicant's October 29, 2003, security 
clearance application.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 6 asks about his employment activities.  He falsely stated that he was unemployed from February 1999 to December 1999, when he was actually employed with an organization (DT) that 
subsequently accused him of deliberately damaging their computer system.   Applicant said he omitted employment information concerning DT because he "did not think [the employer] was still in 
business.  Before submitting my SF-86, I drove by the location that I worked at . . . and they were no longer there."<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  He said he subsequently brought this omission to the attention of the DSS 
interviewer, and previously listed this information on his SF-85P back in 2001.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 26 refers to "Your Police Record - Other Offenses," and asks:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was 
alcohol or drug related.)  For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been sealed or otherwise stricken from the record.  The single exception to this requirement is 
for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under the authority 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded, "Yes."<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> and listed a December 1, 1998, Destruction of Property offense, the particular court where the case was adjudicated and the court's location, as well as the current status 
of the record as expunged.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  In his response to the SOR Applicant asserts he made a prompt, good faith effort to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts, and he explains his 
incorrect answer:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">company security started making urgent requests to submit my SF-86 paperwork.  Due to the urgency, I overlooked this since I did not have the case number, court date, and the official name of the 
charges.  I corrected this by bringing this information directly to [the attention of the DSS agent on December 17, 2004] before my subject interview began.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 26 does not seek and Applicant did not provide the case number or the court date pertaining to his December 1, 1998, Destruction of Property offense.  The most significant criminal offense 
that was not included on his 2003 SF 86 was the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">March 22, 2001, conviction for Computer Illegal Access, which is discussed in greater detail in the next section, <EM>infra</EM>.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR &para; 1.e alleges  the same conduct as alleged in SOR &para;&para; 2.a and 2.b, but as a violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  Neither of Applicant's explanations for the two omissions to his 2003 SF 86 are credible.  I 
infer that he did not list his employment with DT or his 2001 conviction because he wanted to conceal the facts surrounding his 2001 conviction for Computer Illegal Access.  These two omissions are 
material, and deliberate and as such his conduct constitutes a violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Misuse of Information Technology Systems</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DT sought the assistance of the police because DT was receiving numerous spam emails, some including profanity, in sufficient volume to shut down DT's computer system.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  Applicant had 
previously left DT's employment on "bad terms."<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  DT suggested to the police that Applicant might be responsible for the emails.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  On January 12, 2001, he admitted to the police that he was 
responsible for spamming DT.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  While employed at DT, he placed a file on DT's website without DT's permission so that he could access DT's website after his employment terminated.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  He 
subsequently accessed DT's website without DT's permission.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DT provided to the court documentation showing Applicant's misconduct required 84 hours of labor by six of DT's employees, to track down the source of the problem, communicate with police, clean 
the spam off computers, and move their website to a new server.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  Applicant paid DT court ordered restitution of  $5,186.59 as part of his sentence for Computer Illegal Access.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In Applicant's response to the SOR, notarized on April 3, 2006, he explained this offense as follows:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Back in 1999, e-commerce was beginning to evolve and I developed a simple email application.  This simple application was developed to see what capabilities that email can do, which just consisted of 
a web page to enter: to, from subject, and message body information of an email.  At the time, I was  in college working on my undergraduate degree.  Since this was one of my very first software 
programs, I showed it to several classmates and to my wife's friends.  If I had known at the time it would've been used in a malicious manner, I would have disposed of this program.  Unfortunately, I 
was unaware of this [un]til I was charged in reference to subparagraph 1.a [of the SOR].   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's response to the SOR is deliberately misleading.  It does not admit that he personally, and deliberately placed his application on DT's website and then maliciously used his application or 
spamming to damage DT's computer system.  Instead he implies that someone else misused his application, and does not address his spamming of DT's computer network.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In an evaluation of an applicant's security suitability, an administrative judge must consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant's eligibility for 
access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction with 
the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense 
decision.Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.</P> 
 
<P>Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive &para; E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of 
participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and 
(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct  - Guideline J:  "A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness."  Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A10.1.1.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct - Guideline E:<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> "Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information."</STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>  Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.1.</STRONG></SPAN><STRONG> </STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Misuse of Information Technology Systems - Guideline M:  "<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise 
security concerns about an individual's trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to properly protect classified systems, networks, and information.&nbsp; Information Technology Systems include 
all related equipment used for the communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, and storage of classified or sensitive information."  Directive </STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>&para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A13.1.1.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to these three adjudicative guidelines are set forth and 
discussed in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent 
with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have 
avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,  in 
accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government has produced substantial 
evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.  Directive &para; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E3.1.15 provides, "The applicant is responsible </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">for presenting 
witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining 
a favorable clearance decision."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).</SPAN><A HREF="05-09957.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty hours 
and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>The scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides 
industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover 
many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any 
express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG>      </CENTER> 
Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Under Guideline J, a history or pattern of criminal activity raises questions regarding an applicant's willingness or ability to protect classified information and </SPAN>creates doubt about a person's judgment, 
reliability and trustworthiness.  Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN>  </P> 
 
<P>Two criminal conduct disqualifying conditions (CC DC) could raise a security concern in this case.  CC DC 1 applies where there are "[a]llegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of 
whether the person was formally charged" and CC DC 2 applies in situations where an applicant has committed "a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses."  Directive &para;&para; E2.A10.1.2.1 and  
E2.A10.1.2.2.  CC DC 1 and 2 apply because Applicant committed multiple criminal offenses (SOR &para;&para; 1.a, 1.d, and 1.e.), and one of the three offenses is a serious crime (SOR &para; 1.e alleges a violation 
of 18 USC &sect;1001, which is a felony).  In regard to the allegations in SOR &para;&para; 1.b and 1.c, I conclude that these two incidents are not established by substantial evidence. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Security concerns based on criminal conduct can be mitigated by showing that it was not recent (CC MC 1).  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.3.1.  There are no "bright line" rules for determining when conduct is 
"recent."  The determination must be based "on a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive."  ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  If 
the evidence shows "a significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct," then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates "changed

improved his decision-making process. E2.2.1.1. His actions concerning criminal conduct, especially the falsification of his 2003 security clearance application, and his 2001 damage to DT's computer

fully responsible for their conduct.  E2.2.1.4.<SUP></SUP> The likelihood of future criminal conduct and falsifications remains substantial because such a short period of time has elapsed since his last false or 
misleading statement (response to SOR on March 14, 2006), and he has not provided sufficient evidence of a change in his lifestyle.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">E2.2.1.9. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> His relative youth, and achievement of a Master's Degree
