<P>Security concerns persist over Applicant's alcohol abuse which led to multiple alcohol-related arrests and convictions from 1996 to 2001.  He has attended 
alcohol treatment programs and diagnosed alcohol dependent in 2000.  He failed to mitigate these alcohol abuse security concerns as he provided no favorable 
prognosis nor evidence of a continuing involvement in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).  Instead he continues to drink at times to excess.  On the other hand 
Applicant mitigated his multiple other arrests which have not recurred since 1998 and also mitigated his past use and purchase of marijuana which ended in 
2002.  He has substantially reformed his conduct with respect to criminal conduct and drug abuse and is rehabilitated in those areas of security concern.  
Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on September 15, 2003.  The SOR detailed 
reasons why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="03-02892.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns in paragraph 1 over alcohol issues (Guideline G), in paragraph 2 over criminal conduct 
(Guideline J), and in paragraph 3 over drug abuse (Guideline H).  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on October 9, 2003, 
where he requested a hearing.</P> 
 
<P>On January 13, 2004, Department Counsel indicated that the case was ready to proceed.  The case was assigned to me on January 22, 2004.  Subsequently, a 
mutually convenient date for hearing was agreed to.  A Notice of Hearing, issued on January 29, 2004, set the matter for February 27, 2004, at a location near 
where Applicant works and lives. </P> 
 
<P>At the hearing the Government offered eighteen exhibits which were admitted into evidence.  (Exhibits 1-18)  Applicant testified, called three witness, and 
offered three exhibits. (Exhibits A-C).  He requested that the record remain open for seven days to provide additional evidence.  (TR 111) As the Government 
did not object, I granted him seven days and allowed the Government time to review until March 11, 2003, to review his additional evidence.  (TR 112, -113; 
128)  On March 6, 2004, Applicant submitted an additional two-page document (Exhibit D) to Department Counsel.  Department Counsel, who did not object 
to its admission, forwarded the document to me.  I admitted Exhibit D into evidence on March 17, 2004; and the record closed.  The transcript (TR) was 
received on March 8, 2004.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant, 27 years old, worked for Defense Contractor #1 in State #1 from July 2002 to November 2003 when he left because he did not have an interim 
security clearance.  He now works for Defense Contractor #2 and still needs a security clearance; however, no documentation was provided from his new 
employer.  Previously, he had a variety of other jobs.  He completed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) in July 2002.  (Exhibit 1; TR 44-45, 51-53; 62-63; 106)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has studied at a computer center and a community college.  He received computer certification in 1999.  He married in May 2001; he and his wife 
have purchased a home.  He has excellent credit.  (Answer; Exhibit 1; TR 65-67)</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Alcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant first used alcohol when he was 15 years old.  He began regularly consuming alcohol in 1996 when he was 19 years old: he would have 6-9 beers two 
times a week.  At times he would consume twelve beers in an evening.  When his parents were transferred, Applicant moved to State #2 in November 1995 
from State #3 and returned to high school to finish his degree.  He found that State #2 had different standards from State #3 with respect to alcohol abuse; and 
he was frequently arrested.  In 1998 he decreased his drinking to five beers twice per month.  He never believed he had a problem with alcohol, but at times he 
was "unable to remain in control after drinking alcohol."  He has continued to drink, at times to excess; he was last intoxicated in February 2004.  (Answer;

<P>A treatment facility assessed Applicant in April 2000 using a multi-fold diagnostic and evaluation process and diagnosed Applicant as alcohol dependent.  He 
received outpatient treatment for alcohol dependence in group meetings three times a week from April 2000 to July 2000.   He was also required to attend 
twelve step self-help groups and get a sponsor for the one year he was on probation.  When he completed probation, he stopped attending AA.  He abstained 
from alcohol during this program and successfully completed the program.  He never believed he was an alcoholic.  While Applicant claimed he was never told 
that he had been diagnosed alcohol dependent, he had requested a letter from the treatment center to help him get his driving privileges back and that July 2000 
letter disclosed the alcohol dependent diagnosis. (Answer; Exhibits 1, 16; TR 67, 93-96,103-104, 107, 110) (SOR 1.l.)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was arrested in July 2001 in State #1 and charged with operating while intoxicated/DUI.  While this charge was <EM>nolle prosequi</EM>, he admitted he had

<P>A friend who met Applicant in 1999 and later supervised him in 2001-2002 on several projects testified that he never observed Applicant act in an 
untrustworthy or irresponsible way.  He has observed Applicant drink socially.  He "mentored him into technology" and has observed Applicant make "drastic 
changes" in the time he has known him.  (TR 37-48)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's supervisor from October 2002 to January 2003 stated that Applicant's attendance was very good at work; he never came to work intoxicated or 
under the influence of any substance.   He recommended him for a security clearance; he continues to see Applicant as they have become friends.  (TR 49-54)</P> 
 
<P>An individual who hired Applicant at Defense Contractor #1 in spring 2002 and supervised Applicant for two years while he worked for the company 
recommended Applicant for a security clearance.  The company had no concerns about the quality of his work, but terminated Applicant in November 2003 as 
Applicant had not yet been granted a required security clearance.  (TR 55-61)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's supervisor who observed his work for 18 months assessed him as "a trustworthy and responsible individual."  (Exhibit A)</P> 
 
<P>A friend praised Applicant as "a well-balanced person with an abundance of positive qualities."  (Exhibit B)</P> 
 
<P>A government employee who interacted with Applicant from July 2002 to November 2003 saw no reason to question his trustworthiness or integrity.  Applicant 
provided exceptional support to the organization.  (Exhibit C)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's step-father who has known him since he was four years old catalogued the difficulties Applicant faced growing up, but declared in the past fine 
years Applicant has totally changed his lifestyle.  He recommended Applicant for a position of trust.  (Exhibit D)</P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a

</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government established security concerns over Applicant's alcohol abuse as he has a history of drinking to excess and has had multiple alcohol-related 
arrests and convictions  from 1996 to July 2001.  When he was convicted of DWI in 1997 and again in 1999, his license was suspended and he was ordered to 
attend ASAP.  He received a severe sentence after the July 1999 DWI conviction because his alcohol related incidents do indicate a pattern. In 1999 he was 
given one year of probation until July 2000.  Because of this 1999 conviction, he entered an out-patient treatment program where he was diagnosed as alcohol 
dependent.  He abstained from alcohol and complied with the terms of his probation; but after it was completed, he returned to drinking to excess. While he was 
in treatment, Applicant attended AA meetings; but after he completed the alcohol treatment program in 2000, Applicant stopped attending AA, returned to 
drinking to excess.  The treatment program provided no favorable prognosis. He intends to drink in the future and was intoxicated as recently as February 2004.  
Applicant's conduct falls within DC 1 and 5.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant provided some evidence of some positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety; but given his alcohol dependence diagnosis in 2000, he failed 
to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he meets the mitigating condition<A HREF="03-02892.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> (MC ) 4:  Following diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, 
the individual has to successfully complete inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with after-care requirements, participate frequently in meetings of AA, 
has abstained from alcohol for a period of at least 12 months, and received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional or  licensed clinical 
social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program.  While Applicant successfully completed outpatient rehabilitation in 2000, he 
no longer participates in meetings of AA.  While he maintained his sobriety while he was in the treatment program in 2000, he began to drink again after he 
completed his probation.  While his witnesses attested to positive changes in his behavior, it is still too soon to predict that he will be able to maintain this 
sobriety as he no longer attends AA and has returned to intermittent alcohol abuse, at time to excess as recently as February 2004.  Thus, he has not abstained 
from alcohol for at least 12 months.  Further, there is no evidence he received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional or  licensed clinical 
social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program.  Given Applicant's long history of alcohol abuse with eleven alcohol-related 
incidents from 1996 to 2001 and his continuing intermittent abuse of alcohol, it is too soon to conclude with certainty that he has sufficiently changed his 
behavior.</P> 
 
<P> After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on Subparagraph 1.f. where the charge was dismissed, 
but against Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a. though 1.e. and 1.g. through 1.n. under SOR Paragraph 1.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>As discussed above under alcohol abuse, the Government established security concerns over his criminal conduct as related to his  alcohol use, (SOR 1.b., 1.c., 
1.d., 1.e., 1.g., 1.h., 1.j., 1.k, and 1.m.) and also over multiple criminal incidents alleged under SOR paragraph 2.  Except for allegation 2.c. where the charges 
were dropped, Applicant repeatedly engaged in criminal conduct from 1995 to 1998, including an incident at a department store where he worked and stole 
merchandise, but was not criminally charged.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: a. allegations or admissions of 
criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged; and b. a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.  </P> 
 
<P>On the other hand Applicant's last criminal incident was in 1998 and his last alcohol-related conviction was in 1999.  Applicant stated persuasively that he has 
no intention of again engaging in criminal conduct which was mostly a product of his troubled teenage and young adult years.  He testified that he has changed 
and provided several references who supported his rehabilitation from criminal conduct.  Thus, I conclude he has met conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns include: a. the criminal behavior was not recent; d. the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur; f. there is clear evidence of successful 
rehabilitation.  Applicant provided sufficient evidence that he has reformed<A HREF="03-02892.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> his conduct and that the factors leading to those violations are unlikely to recur.  
He provided several favorable references and reference letters from his work colleagues, his supervisors and his step-father which establish clear evidence of his 
successful rehabilitation.  One supervisor from 2001-2002 on several projects testified that he never observed Applicant act in an untrustworthy or irresponsible 
way.  He has observed Applicant make "drastic changes." Another supervisor from 2002 to 2003 recommended him for a security clearance.  Finally, the 
individual who hired Applicant at Defense Contractor #1 in spring 2002 and supervised Applicant for two years while he worked for the company 
recommended him for a security clearance and had no concerns about the quality of his work.</P> 
 
<P>Consequently,  after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraph 2.a. through 2. h. under 
SOR Paragraph 2.</P>

<P>The Government established security concerns over Applicant's drug use to May 2002 and his intermittent marijuana purchases.  (SOR 3.a. and 3.b.)  
Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. any drug abuse and 2. illegal drug possession, including purchase.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DOHA Appeal Board recently ruled in a Guideline H case that there must be a "reasoned analysis of all of the facts and circumstance of an applicant's case 
based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence" as there is no "bright line"<A HREF="03-02892.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> to determine when conditions could mitigate security concerns under 
C 1, whether or not the drug involvement was recent.  In that case they found six years since the last use of marijuana met that test.  Here it has been </SPAN>two 
years since May 2002 when he last used marijuana to celebrate his birthday.  Two months later he went to work for Defense Contractor #1 and completed his 
SF 86<A HREF="03-02892.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> in July 2002.  He has not used marijuana since that time.  He disclosed this past marijuana use in November 2002 when interviewed by the Defense 
Security Service (DSS).   Since he has refrained from any drug use while he has been in a job that requires a security clearance, I conclude that his two years of 
abstinence is sufficient to mitigate his drug use.  I accept his statement that he has no intent to use drugs in the future to establish, under MC 3, his demonstrated 
intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.  His favorable references also establish how he has substantially  changed.  Thus, Applicant provided sufficient 
evidence that he has reformed<A HREF="03-02892.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 
<P> his conduct.   </P>

for the Applicant.</P>
