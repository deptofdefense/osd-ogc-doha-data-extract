documents identified as Items 1 through 10.  On December 12, 2003, a copy of the FORM was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any 
additional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant did not submit any information within 30 days after receiving a copy of the

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains nine allegations of disqualifying conduct.  Five allegations relate to conduct alleged under Guideline H, Drug Involvement; two allegations 
relate to conduct alleged under Guideline E, Personal Conduct; and two allegations relate to conduct alleged under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.  In his 
answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all nine allegations.  His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 54-year-old computing systems specialist employed by a federal contractor.  He has never been married.  He is the father of a ten-year-old child.  
His background was investigated by the Defense Department in 1998 for the purpose of determining his security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of illegal drug use.  He used marijuana, with varying frequency, as much as two to three times weekly from 1969 to 1972.  From 1979 to 
1993 he used marijuana two times weekly, and from 1995 to March 1998, he used marijuana two times weekly.  He also purchased marijuana.  (Item 5, at 4.)  
He used cocaine, with varying frequency, at times two to three times monthly from approximately 1980 to 1988, two to three times monthly from 1989 to 1993, 
and two to three times monthly from 1995 to December 1997.  He also purchased cocaine.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 8, 1993, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of a narcotic schedule II controlled substance; possession of drug paraphernalia; 
maintaining a vehicle for keeping controlled substances; possession of a non-narcotic schedule controlled substance; carrying a concealed deadly weapon; and 
speeding.  On September 24, 1993 Applicant pleaded guilty and was placed in a first offender program with respect to the charges of possession of marijuana 
and possession of cocaine. He was sentenced to three years probation and required to complete a 16-hour first offender drug rehabilitation program. All other 
charges were <EM>nolle prossed.  </EM>(Items 9 and 10)  By Order dated January 30, 1998, all records of Applicant's August 8, 1993 arrest were expunged.  The Order 
stated: "That as of the date of the Order, it shall no longer be necessary for the Petitioner to report or acknowledge that he was ever arrested on the charges of 
Possession of a Narcotic Schedule II Controlled Substance, Possession of Drug Paraphernalia, Maintaining a Vehicle for Keeping Controlled Substances, 
Possession of a Non-Narcotic Schedule I Controlled Substance, Carrying a Concealed Deadly Weapon, and Speeding...."  At the time he petitioned the court for 
an expungement of his 1993 drug arrest, Applicant was using illegal drugs.  (Items 5 and 10.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In an interview with a special agent of the Defense Investigative Service on April 29, 1999, Applicant denied using illegal drugs during the previous seven years 
and denied being involved in the purchase, sale, production, manufacture, or trafficking of any controlled substances during the previous seven years. (Item 7.)  
In a subsequent interview with a special agent of the Defense Investigative Service, Applicant admitted deliberately falsifying his drug use in his April 29, 1999 
interview.  He said he was not truthful about his illegal use and purchase of marijuana and cocaine because he feared telling the truth would affect his career 
and his livelihood.  (Item 8.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF-86) on January26, 2001.  Applicant answered "no to Question 27 on the SF-86, which reads as 
follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Illegal Use of Drugs.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, 
hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.) hallucinogens (LSD, 
PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant signed and dated the following certification at the end of his security clearance application on January 26, 2001:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>CERTIFICATION BY PERSON COMPLETING FORM</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">My statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.  I 
understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See section 1001 of title 18, United States 
Code)."</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>&sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H, Drug Involvement</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, at times two to three times weekly from 1969 to 1972; 
two times weekly from 1979 to 1993; and two times weekly from 1995 to March 1998 (&para; 1.a.); that he purchased marijuana (&para; 1.b.); that he used cocaine, with 
varying frequency, at times two to three times monthly from approximately 1980 to 1988; two to three times monthly from 1989 to 1993; and two to three times 
monthly from 1995 to December 1997 (&para; 1.c.); that he purchased cocaine (&para; 1.d.); that he was arrested on August 8, 1993 and charged with possession of a 
narcotic schedule II controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, maintaining a vehicle for keeping controlled substances, possession of a non-narcotic schedule I controlled substance, carrying a concealed deadly weapon, and speeding; and that he pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine and possession 
of marijuana, was placed in a first offenders' program requiring three years of probation, 20 hours of community service, completion of a 16-hour drug 
rehabilitation program, assessment of court costs, and suspension of his driver's license for one year. (&para; 1.e.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's concern with Guideline H conduct is that it raises questions regarding an individual's willingness to protect classified information.  Drug 
abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, thereby increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.  &para; 
E2.A8.1.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Drugs are defined under Guideline H as mood and behavior-altering substances, including drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed 
in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, and inhalants and other similar substances. &para;&para; E2.A8.1.1.2., E2.A8.1.1.2.1., E2.A8.1.1.2.2.  Drug abuse 
is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.  &para; E2.A8.1.1.3.  Marijuana, or cannabis, and cocaine 
are  identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, as controlled substances.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Through Applicant's own admissions, the Government established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case that he used marijuana for 20 years, purchased marijuana, used cocaine 
for 14 years, purchased cocaine, and pleaded guilty to marijuana and cocaine possession in 1993.  Applicant has admitted Guideline H drug involvement 
specified in the SOR and identified as disqualifying under &para;&para; E2.A8.1.2.1. and E2.A8.1.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record shows that Applicant's involvement with marijuana began in 1969, when he was approximately 18 years old.  His involvement with cocaine began 
in 1980, when he was 29 years old.  He completed a court-ordered drug awareness program in the first offenders' program in 1993, but continued to use 
marijuana until 1998 and cocaine until December 1997.  Applicant was using drugs at the time he petitioned the court to expunge his 1993 arrest for drug use.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's last drug use occurred seven and eight years ago, demonstrating that his drug involvement was not recent, and, accordingly, mitigating condition 
E2.A8.1.3.1. applies.  However, Applicant's drug use spanned a period from 1969 to 1998, a period of almost 30 years.  He began using drugs at age 18, in his 
young manhood, and he continued using drugs throughout a substantial portion of his adult life, until he was 47 years old.  Thus, his drug involvement was 
neither isolated nor aberrational and represented a consistent and long-term lifestyle choice.  Therefore, mitigating condition E2.A8.1.3.2. does not apply.  
Applicant asserted in his answer to the SOR that he has learned from his mistakes and is now a model citizen and father.  In his signed, sworn statement of June 
3, 1999, he stated he did not intend to use illegal drugs in the future.  (Item 8, at 1-2.)  However, he provided no plan or rationale for relinquishing his 30-year 
habit of drug use.  Absent some clear demonstration of how he planned to maintain abstinence, his assurances that he will not use drugs in the future lacks 
credibility, and thus mitigating condition E2.A8.1.3.3 is inapplicable.  Accordingly, allegations in the SOR of disqualifying conduct under Guideline H are 
concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E,  Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant raised concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, when he falsified his answer to Question 27 on the SF-86 by 
denying illegal drug use in the previous seven years, when he knew he had used cocaine and marijuana in the seven-year period prior to signing and certifying 
his SF-86 on January 26, 2001. (&para; 2.a.)  Additionally, DOHA alleged Applicant  raised Guideline E concerns when he falsified material facts on a signed, sworn 
statement he provided to a special agent of the Defense Investigative Service by denying he had used and purchased marijuana and cocaine during the seven 
years prior to April 29, 1999. (&para; 2.b.)  Guideline E conduct, which involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, 
or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, could indicate an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in the SOR, the Government has established its case.  Applicant's failure to answer Question 27 completely, 
truthfully, and correctly raises a security concern under &para; E2.A5.1.2.2 of Guideline E.  His deliberate false statement to an investigator in connection with a 
personal security or trustworthiness determination raises a concern under &para; E2. A5.1.2.3.  In a second signed sworn statement to a special agent of the Defense 
Investigative Service, dated June 3, 1999, Applicant admitted lying about his illegal drug use in his signed sworn statement of April 29, 1999. He said he was 
concerned that telling the truth about his drug use would have negative impacts on his career and livelihood. (Item 8, at 2.)  His concealment of information he 
considered embarrassing or professionally damaging could make him vulnerable to coercion and blackmail. &para;E2.A5.1.2.4.  His conduct raises additional 
concerns under E2.A5.1.2.5. because it suggests a pattern of dishonesty or rule violation.  Applicant's reticence to reveal the truth about his conduct suggests 
that, under some circumstances, he may put his interests before those of the Government. It is well established that embarrassment is not a mitigating condition 
under the Directive.  ISCR Case No. 99-0557 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul.10, 2000).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating condition E2.A5.1.3.1 does not apply to the facts of this case: The information Applicant withheld is pertinent to a determination of his judgment, 
trustworthiness, and reliability.  Only one other mitigating condition under Guideline E might be applicable to the instant case.  The security concern raised by 
Applicant's disqualifying conduct could be mitigated if the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and if the Applicant subsequently provided the 
correct information voluntarily. &para;E.2.A.5.1.3.2.  Applicant supplied the correct information when questioned a second time by a special agent of the Defense 
Investigative Service.  While his falsifications were not recent, they were not isolated incidents.  Accordingly, allegations in subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b. of the 
SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J, Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was arrested, charged, and pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine and marijuana in August 1993, conduct which 
provides evidence of a history of criminal activity. (&para; 3.a.)  The SOR also alleged Applicant deliberately falsified material facts on his security clearance 
application (SF-86) when he lied about his drug use and deliberately falsified his signed, sworn statement of April 29, 1999 when he lied about his drug use in 
the previous seven years. (&para; 3.b.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When he completed his SF-86, Applicant signed his name and certified that his statement was true, complete and correct to the best of his knowledge and 
belief.  Further, he acknowledged his understanding that a false statement on the SF-86 could be punished as a felony crime by fine or imprisonment under the 
provisions of section 1001 of title 18, United States Code.  Applicant admitted making a knowing and willful false statement in his response to Question 27 on 
his SF-86.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided a  sworn written statement to a special agent of the Defense Investigative Service and signed his name below the following statement, which 
reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I make this statement without any threats having been made against me or any promise extended to me.  I certify that the following statement is true, complete 
and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief and is made in good faith.  I understand that a knowing and willful false statement can be punished by fine 
or imprisonment or both.  (See U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1001.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under section 1001 of title 18 of the United States Code, it is a felony crime to make a writing or document, knowing it contains a materially false, fictitious, or 
fraudulent statement.  Applicant admitted preparing and signing a written statement in which he lied about his drug use.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concern under Guideline J is that an individual's history or pattern of criminal activity raises doubts about his judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based upon trust and confidence.  
Where the facts proven by the Government or admitted by the applicant raise doubts about the applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant 
has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nevertheless security worthy.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's criminal behavior which led to his guilty plea of possession of marijuana and cocaine occurred in 1993, a dozen years ago. His falsifications of his 
security clearance application and signed, sworn statement occurred in 2001 and 1999, respectively.  While these criminal acts were not recent, they were not 
isolated events but rather a pattern of criminal conduct.  Thus, while &para; E2.A10.1.3.1. of Guideline J applies in mitigation to these acts, &para; E2.A10.1.3.2 of the 
Guideline does not.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits the criminal conduct alleged by the Government in subparagraph 1.e. of the SOR., a security concern under &para; E2.A10.1.2.1.of Guideline J.  He 
also admits knowingly falsifying his response to Question 27 on his SF-86 and preparing and signing a deliberately false written statement denying any drug use 
during the seven years preceding 1999.  Applicant's acts constitute disqualifying conduct under &para; E2.A10.1.2.2. of Guideline J.  None of the Guideline J 
mitigating factors apply.  Thus, the Guideline J allegations in the SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
