<P>This 29-year-old American was born in Hong Kong to an American father and a Hong Kong mother.  His father registered his birth with U.S. authorities.  
Applicant came to the U.S. in1988,  at age 14, to attend school.  A member of the Marine Corps Reserve (1992 to 2000), he also attended and graduated from 
college (1993 to 1999) with a B.S. in Engineering.  His only foreign ties are his elderly father and mother, who live in Hong Kong, but who are now in the 
process of emigrating to the U.S., with Applicant as his mother's sponsor.  I find little risk that they would be asked to persuade him to act against U.S. 
interests, or that they would ask him. Based on his history and proven commitment to the U.S., there is minimal risk Applicant would ever act against U.S. 
interests.  Mitigation has been established.  Clearance is granted. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 11, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and</P> 
 
<P>determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>On August 28, 2003, Applicant submitted a response to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative 
Judge after a hearing.  The matter was assigned to me for resolution on October 7, 2003.  On October 30, 2003, a Notice of Hearing was issued, setting the 
hearing for November 18, 2003.  At the hearing, the Government did not present any witnesses but offered three exhibits, which were marked for identification 
as Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2.  Applicant testified and offered six exhibits, which were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AX) A - F.  All exhibits were 
admitted without objection.  The transcript (Tr) was received at DOHA on December 5, 2003. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 29 years old.  The SOR contains two allegations, 1.a. and 1.b. under Guideline  B (Foreign Influence).  As to SOR 1.a., Applicant denies that his 
father is a dual citizen of the U.S. and China.  As to SOR 1.b., Applicant admits his mother is a citizen of and resident in Hong Kong.  The admission cited 
above is incorporated herein as a Finding of Fact.</P> 
 
<P>After considering the totality of the evidence derived from the hearing testimony and all evidence of record, I make the following additional FINDINGS OF 
FACT as to each SOR allegation:</P> 
 
<P>Guideline B (Foreign Influence)   </P> 
 
<P>1.a. and 1.b. - Applicant's <EM>father</EM> is a U.S. citizen only.  He came to the U.S. in the 1950s to attend college.  He became a U.S. citizen in 1968 and renounced his 
Hong Kong citizenship.  In about 1970, he returned to Hong Kong, where he met and married Applicant's mother, and continued to work there until 1998, at 
which time he retired but stayed in Hong Kong.  Applicant was born in Hong Kong in October 1974, at which time Hong Kong was controlled by Great Britain, 
but which is now part of the People's Republic of China (China).  Applicant was an American citizen by birth because his father was (and remains) a U.S. 
citizen (AX B at 5, GX 1 and GX 2).   </P> 
 
<P>Applicant came to the United States in 1988, at age 14, because his parents wanted him to have a better education.  He lived with a relative in State A for one 
year and then moved to State B, where he lived with his mother's sister and her family for three years before entering college.  He enrolled in the U.S. Marine 
Corps Reserve in 1992 and served until 2000, with the rank of corporal (E4), during which time he also attended and graduated from college with an 
Engineering degree  (<EM>Id.</EM>). </P> 
 
<P>1.b. - Applicant's <EM>mother</EM> has at all time been a citizen of Hong Kong/China and resided there.  She worked as tour guide and is now retired.  She never became 
a U.S. citizen and has never resided here.  He has no brothers or sisters.  In fact, Applicant is the only member of his family to reside in the U.S. (<EM>Id</EM>.).  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant speaks to his mother and father only once in a while on the telephone (<EM>Id.</EM>, AX C and AX D).  Applicant and his father "were never really that close" 
(GX 2).  Applicant has visited Hong Kong twice since his 1998 arrival in the U.S., in 1996 and 1997 (<EM>Id.</EM>).  He speaks to his parents periodically.  He has no 
siblings.  Applicant has "completely assimilated into life in the United States and has no desire to ever leave" (<EM>Id.</EM>, at 3).  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant received an Honorable Discharge from the U.S. Marine Corps in November 1999 (AX B at 1); a highly positive citation from the Brigadier General 
commanding his unit (AX B at 2); a Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty that cited his accomplishments in the Marine Corps and his 
acceptance in a Reserve Special Enlistment Program (Id., at 3); and a Meritorious Mast citation praising Applicant for professional achievement and superior 
performance (<EM>Id.</EM>, at 4).  Applicant is "an American" and "can't be coerced or blackmailed for any reason.  I would never betray my country, the United States" 
(<EM>Id</EM>.).</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant</P> 
 
<P>in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding</P> 
 
<P>the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the</P> 
 
<P>individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)</P> 
 
<P>the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation</P> 
 
<P>for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood</P> 
 
<P>of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my 
overall conclusion.</P> 
 
<P>Considering the evidence as a whole, I find the following specific adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</P> 
 
<P>Guideline C (Foreign Influence) </P> 
 
<P>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family [members] . . . are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These 
situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries 
. . . are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially  vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. </P> 
 
<P>Condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:</P> 
 
<P>1. An immediate family member . . . is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country;</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>1. A determination that the immediate family member(s) . . . in question would not constitute an unacceptable risk. </P> 
 
<P>3. Contacts and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual or infrequent. </P> 
 
<P>The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related 
to the ultimate question of</P> 
 
<P>whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  An applicant's admission of the information in specific 
allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are denied or  otherwise controverted by the 
applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  </P> 
 
<P>If the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the 
Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, 
despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or 
continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>There is no dispute as to the basic facts in this case.  This 29-year-old U.S. citizen was born in Hong Kong in 1974 to an American father.  His birth and U.S. 
citizenship was registered with U.S. authorities (GX 1).  He came to the U.S. in 1988 and has lived here ever since, attending college and spending eight years 
in the Marine Corps, 1992 to 2000, where he was a highly respected air defense gunner.  He considers himself to be only an American, and has spent eight years 
of his still young life dedicated to the country's defense.  </P> 
 
<P>The only concerns cited in the SOR are (1) that his father, who was a citizen of Hong Kong, came to the U.S. in the 1950s, became a U.S. citizen in 1968, then 
returned to Hong Kong as a U.S. citizen  in the early 1970s, married and fathered Applicant, worked and retired, and chose to remain in Hong Kong with his 
Hong Kong born wife, Applicant's mother; and (2) that his Hong Kong born mother never became a U.S. citizen and has spent her life in Hong Kong. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's father was born in 1932 and his mother in 1937 (GX 1).  Both reside in Hong Kong, now a part of the People's Republic of China.   China is 
considered by the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government to be significantly involved in military and industrial espionage against the U.S. (GX 3).  While 
the citizenship and/or presence of fact of relatives in any foreign country is of security concern, the fact that the other country is China is of particular concern, 
since the risks of attempts to commit espionage in cases such as the present one must be considered even higher that with other countries.  At the same time, the 
existence of foreign relatives is only one factor among many, and must be considered in the context of all available information.</P> 
 
<P>On this basis, I have carefully considered the presence of Applicant's mother and father in Hong Kong and his relationship with them.  Considering the nature 
of the relationship and the lack of any efforts to subvert Applicant in the past, the extent of the risk of his parents asking him to act improperly certainly exists, 
but it is not high.  What I find most persuasive is Applicant's history  and ties to the U.S.  Applicant left his home in Hong Kong almost 14 years ago, when he 
was 16. He has been back to Hong Kong only twice during that long period, years ago, to see his parent, now about 67 and 72 years old.  </P> 
 
<P>At the hearing, Applicant introduced evidence that his mother is now interested in becoming a U.S. citizen and that Applicant is sponsoring her (AX E, dated 
June 4, 2003).  Both parents are now interested in moving to the U.S. (Tr at 22). Applicant is not aware of anything suggesting that they are or have been agents 
of or otherwise connected to the Chinese government.(<EM>Id</EM>.).  Any discussion of the risk that they may be asked or coerced by the Chinese government to pressure 
Applicant to reveal American defense secrets in the future is necessarily speculative.  It may happen, but there is no record evidence suggesting that it will.  </P> 
 
<P>The burden of proof on Applicants with foreign relatives is a heavy one and, logically, proving a negative is difficult to do.  What Applicant has established by 
his eight years of military duty and honorable discharge is the extent of his commitment to the U.S.  So, while his stated intent to report any improper contact in 
the future, from whatever source, is really a promise of future conduct rather than evidence of past behavior, I find his promise to be both credible and 
persuasive, based on the totality of the record. </P> 
 
<P>Disqualification and Mitigation, </P> 
 
<P>Foreign Influence - Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1 (family members who are foreign citizens) is applicable, but Mitigating Condition (MC) 1 (a determination 
that the foreign relatives would not constitute an unacceptable security risk) also applies and outweighs the impact of DC 1.</P> 
 
<P>Overall, I conclude that Applicant has shown himself to be a man of integrity and one who takes his obligations seriously.  Considering the evidence as a whole, 
I conclude that the evidence does not show that any risk exists that Applicant would ever act against U.S. security interests. </P>
