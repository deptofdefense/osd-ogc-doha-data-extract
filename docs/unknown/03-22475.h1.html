<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>This case arose when the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On December 21, 
2004, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.<A HREF="03-22475.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged a 
security concern under Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant replied to the SOR on February 17, 2005, and requested a hearing. The case was 
assigned to me June 27, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for September 15, 2005. Applicant appeared without counsel and the 
hearing took place as scheduled. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional documentary exhibits, and those matters are admitted 
without objections as Exhibit E (cell phone account statement) and Exhibit F (earnings statement). DOHA received the transcript September 29, 2005.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>In her Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in subparagraphs 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, and 1.k, and she denied the allegations in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 
1.h, and 1.i. In addition, she provided a brief explanation for each admission and denial. Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein 
by reference. In addition, I make the following findings of fact.</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 46-year-old woman who is seeking to retain a security clearance for employment with a defense contractor. She has two adult children, a son age 
24 and a daughter age 26. Hired by her current employer in September 1998, she works as a data communication engineer. Her current annual salary is about 
$79,000.</P> 
<P>She has been married and divorced twice. Applicant first married in July 1989. The marriage was apparently troubled from its early days and it ended in divorce 
in August 1991. Her second marriage took place in June 1999 and ended in divorce in March 2004. </P> 
<P>Applicant enlisted and served on active duty with the U.S. Navy from about January 1979 to May 1988. She served as a radioman, which involved working on a 
ship's communications systems. She left active duty at the rank of petty officer second class (pay grade E-5). Applicant, who was a single mother, obtained a 
hardship discharge so she could care for her then six-year-old son who had been hit by a car resulting in the child being placed in a body cast. </P> 
<P>Applicant has a history of financial problems. In July 1989 (the time of her first marriage), Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition that listed 1) $3,400 
in total assets; 2) $10,760 in unsecured debt; and 3) $3,334 in secured debt. She proposed a repayment plan of $156 per month for 36 months, and the plan was 
confirmed as proposed. Applicant made the monthly payments and fulfilled the requirements of the plan, and the court granted Applicant a discharge in January 
1993.</P> 
<P>She attributes the bankruptcy to out-of-pocket medical costs for her son as well as a two-month period of unemployment and a period of underemployment as a 
security guard. </P> 
<P>Applicant separated from her second husband in about February 2001. As a result, she was left with additional bills and all the household expenses. Applicant 
and her son moved out of their townhouse in December 2001 and moved in with a cousin. Applicant now pays her cousin $900 monthly rent. She has a monthly 
car payment of $364 plus $156 in insurance. Her cell phone bill ranges from $75 to $80 monthly. She tithes about $600 monthly to her place of worship, and 
she gives another $200 monthly in collection. She provides periodic financial help to her adult son and daughter. She is current with her rent and car payments. 
She contributes 10% of her salary to a 401(k) retirement account, which has a balance of about $30,000. She is repaying a loan taken against her 401(k) account 
in the amount of $111.74 per pay period (Exhibit F). Other than this account, she has no other financial assets or resources, and she had less than $500 in her 
checking account. </P> 
<P>A credit report (Exhibit 3), dated March 2004, revealed derogatory financial information. The SOR appears to rely, in part, on Exhibit 3 as the basis for the 
allegations. The table below summarizes the details about the ten accounts in the SOR, including a general description, the current status, and cites to the 
relevant part of the record.</P>

<P>The six accounts described as unpaid are accounts that she does not dispute, and she has made no specific arrangements to pay these six accounts.</P> 
<P>In addition to the accounts in the table, another credit report (Exhibit 4) was obtained in June 2005. It reveals three unpaid collection accounts for medical bills 
for $207, $186, and $684, as well as an unpaid collection account for $645. She attributes the outstanding medical bills to a surgery (Answer). Also, the report 
reveals another unpaid judgment for $850.</P> 
<P>Applicant attributes her financial problems to an accumulation of circumstances: 1) her hardship discharge from the Navy; 2) the period of unemployment and 
underemployment after her discharge from the Navy; 3) five months of unemployment from August to December 1993; 4) four months of unemployment from 
August to November 1997; 5) her two marriages that ended in divorce; and 6) the difficulty of raising two children as a single mother. Her plan or intent is to 
save the necessary money and then make lump-sum offers to her various creditors. She used this approach to pay the bad debt in subparagraph 1.b. She learned 
this approach in 2004 when she took a credit course at her place of worship. </P> 
<P>  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on 
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree of 
trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security </P> 
<P>clearance is not a determination of an applicant's loyalty.<A HREF="03-22475.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has 
established for granting a clearance. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-22475.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> There is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="03-22475.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of presenting witnesses 
and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.<A HREF="03-22475.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> An applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to 
refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.<A HREF="03-22475.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-22475.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly 
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="03-22475.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and 
the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, a security concern typically exists for two different types of situations--significant unpaid debts or unexplained affluence. An individual 
who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual 
who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information. 
Some people encounter financial problems through no fault of their own. For others, financial problems appear to be part of a general tendency toward 
irresponsibility that is a security concern.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline F.<A HREF="03-22475.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> The Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, the unpaid 
unemployment debt, the charged off accounts, the collections accounts, and the unpaid civil judgments demonstrate a history of not meeting financial 
obligations as well as inability or unwillingness to pay one's just debts.<A HREF="03-22475.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> These matters, taken together, raise a security concern under the guideline. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I reviewed the mitigating conditions under the guideline and conclude Applicant receives some credit in mitigation. First, Applicant's financial problems cannot 
be viewed as not recent because the evidence shows her problems are current and ongoing.<A HREF="03-22475.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  The June 2005 credit report (Exhibit 4) is evidence on this point. 
Second, her financial problems cannot be viewed as an isolated incident given the multiple delinquent accounts incurred over an extended period.<A HREF="03-22475.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Third, it is a 
mitigating condition that Applicant's financial problems are not solely the result of her own making. The periods of unemployment and underemployment, her 
two divorces, and the other matters noted above have no doubt contributed to her financial problems.<A HREF="03-22475.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Fourth, Applicant also receives credit in mitigation 
based on her taking the credit course in 2004.<A HREF="03-22475.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> But the mitigation is limited because 1) the course was a one-time event as opposed to a period of counseling 
with a financial professional; and 2) her financial problems are ongoing (Exhibit 4). Finally, Applicant receives credit in mitigation for her efforts to repay or 
otherwise resolve her debts.<A HREF="03-22475.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> She paid or otherwise resolved four of the ten accounts listed in the table. She also has a plan to make lump-sum offers to settle 
the other debts. But the mitigation is limited because 1) it will no doubt take  some time for Applicant to acquire the money to make the offers; and 2) she 
continues to incur more delinquent debt (Exhibit 4).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the record evidence as a whole, Applicant is in a tenuous financial position. Although she earns a good salary and has a relatively low rent payment, 
she is essentially living paycheck-to-paycheck (for example, she has less than $500 in her checking account). Likewise, there are not strong indicators that her 
financial problems are being resolved, are under control, or are unlikely to recur. The record evidence shows the opposite as evidenced by 1) the six unpaid 
debts in the table; and 2) the four additional collection accounts and an additional unpaid judgment listed in the June 2005 credit report (Exhibit 4). Applicant's 
efforts to resolve her financial problems are clearly a work in progress and time will tell if she is both willing and able to put her financial house in order. Taken 
together, Applicant's current financial situation is not indicative of a responsible person who can be relied upon to properly handle and safeguard classified 
information. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided against Applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To conclude, Applicant has not met her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I considered the 
evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, the whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and other appropriate factors and guidelines in 
the Directive.   </SPAN></P>
