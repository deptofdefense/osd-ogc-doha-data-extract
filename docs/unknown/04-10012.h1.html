<P>The Applicant is a dual citizen of Jordan and the United States.  He has not surrendered his Jordanian passport or renounced his Jordanian citizenship.  He has substantial foreign financial interests, 
namely a house and a bank account valued at about a half million dollars, that poses a significant security risk.  Clearance is denied.  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 4, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be 
denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 31, 2006, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on July 6, 2006.  A 
notice of hearing was issued on August 2, 2006, scheduling the hearing for August 24, 2006.  At the hearing the Government presented seven exhibits.  The Applicant presented three exhibits and 
he testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on August 30, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 16, 2000, a memorandum was issued by Mr. Arthur Money, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, clarifying "the application of 
Guideline C to cases involving an Applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport."  The Applicant received a copy of this memorandum.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 4).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the testimony.  The Applicant is 41 years of age and holds a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering.  He is 
employed as a Project Engineer for a defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts that could create the potential 
for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was born in Kuwait in 1965.  He and his family moved to Jordan in 1978.  In 1983, at the age of eighteen, he came to the United States to attend college.  After graduating with a 
Bachelor's Degree in Engineering in 1989, he was granted a work visa and he obtained a job.  After four years with a work visa, he became eligible and applied for legal residency.  He became self-employed in 1998, and in 2001, he became a United States citizen.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's parents, one brother and two sisters remain citizens and residents of Jordan.  The Applicant's father is retired from the stationery business, but invested in real estate much of his 
life.  His mother is a housewife.  The Applicant remains in regular contact with his parents.  The Applicant's brother is in the ladies accessories business.  His two sisters in Jordan are both 
housewives.  One is married to a carpenter, the other is married to a man who works on printers and copiers.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> None of the Applicant's family members in Jordan are affiliated with the Jordanian government in any capacity. The Applicant considers himself close with all of his family and he travels to visit 
them in Jordan on a annual basis at Christmas time.  Until 1992, he did not travel frequently to Jordan due to limited financial means.  Since then he has traveled to Jordan almost every year at 
Christmas time.  He most recent traveled to Jordan in December 2005 to January 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant also has two other sisters who reside in the United States.  One of them is a Jordanian citizen.  The other sister is a dual citizen of both the United States and Jordan. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has several significant financial assets in Jordan.  He owns a house valued between approximately $75,000.00 to $100,000.00.  He inherited the house from his father.  The Applicant 
claims that the house is in his name only, but that he does not receive any profits from the property since his family rents the house out for income property.  The Applicant plans to keep the house 
in Jordan out of respect for his family and he has no desire to sell it.  He also maintains a bank account in Jordan that has about $400,000.00 in it.  (Tr. p. 31).  He transfers money into the Jordanian 
account periodically so that when he visits his family, he is able to use money from that account to treat his nieces, nephews and parents.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's financial portfolio in the United States indicates that he  has over 1.3 million in assets here.  (Tr. p. 32 and Applicant's Exhibit A).  These assets include numerous savings accounts, 
investment accounts and real property.  He further states that when he gets a chance, he will transfer most of his money in his Jordanian account to the United States.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Until December 2005, the Applicant possessed approximately ten acres of land in Jordan valued at approximately $400,000.00.  He sold the property in December 2005, and the money was placed 
in a Jordanian bank account.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a way as to show a preference 
for another country over the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admits that he is a dual citizen of Jordan and the United States.  He initially obtained a Jordanian passport on January 2, 2000, for foreign travel purposes.  The Jordanian passport 
expired on January 1, 2005, and was subsequently renewed.  He currently possesses an active Jordanian passport that is not scheduled to expire until March 21, 2010.  He does not plan to use it or 
renew it again.  Since obtaining his United States passport in 2001, he has not used his Jordanian passport to travel.  He is aware of the Money Memorandum and its provisions.  He claims that he 
tried to surrender his Jordanian passport, but that the Jordanian Embassy does not handle the process anymore.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibit C).  He also stated that in order to possess property in 
Jordan he must have a Jordanian passport.  He has not yet renounced his Jordanian citizenship, because he was in the middle of a move, but plans to do so if it is necessary.  He believes that it may 
be necessary for him to travel to Jordan to renounce his citizenship and he might be more of a target in Jordan under these circumstances.  (Tr. p. 35).        </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Letters of recommendation submitted on behalf of the Applicant from the Director of Propulsion and Fluid Product Center and a Program Manager indicate that he is an excellent performer, with 
excellent work habits who is very well respected by all of his peers and the management team.  He is considered hard working, diligent, thorough and completes all tasks on time.  He shows a high 
level of integrity, honesty and trustworthiness.  (<EM>See </EM>Applicant's Exhibit B).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors and conditions that could raise or 
mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent 
criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on her own common sense.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  
Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Preference</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful 
to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. The exercise of dual citizenship;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens 
of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with 
citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. An immediate family member, or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">8. A substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign owned or operated business that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 
10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number 
of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   
The Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . . . shall be a determination 
in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference) and Guideline B (foreign influence) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  
While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a 
rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct, is unlikely to be 
repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates a foreign preference and has foreign connections may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  The 
mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the United States paramount to that of another nation. The 
Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this Administrative Judge concludes that 
the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's foreign contacts have a direct and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is a dual citizen of Jordan and the United States who possesses a Jordanian passport.  Disqualifying Conditions, <EM>(1) The exercise of dual citizenship </EM>and<EM> (2) Possession and/or use of a 
foreign passport</EM> apply.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since learning that possession of a foreign passport is not permitted when holding a security clearance, the Applicant has done nothing to bring himself in compliance with the provisions of the 
oney Memorandum.  He has not surrendered his foreign passport to the Jordanian Embassy, nor has he renounced his Jordanian citizenship.  Although he states that he plans to do these things, he 
has not done them yet.  If his excuse is that he did not know what to do, he has not exercised due diligence to even find out what to do.   Accordingly, he has clearly not demonstrated an unequivocal 
preference for the United States.  Under the circumstances of this case, I find against the Applicant under Guideline C. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline B, the evidence establishes that he is vulnerable to foreign influence.  The Applicant's father, mother, two sisters and a brother are all citizens and residents of Jordan.  The 
Applicant has close, regular, frequent and continuing contact with his parents and siblings.  Furthermore, the Applicant's foreign bank account and his foreign property are substantial financial 
interests in Jordan that make him vulnerable to foreign influence.  In fact, his net worth in Jordan is approximately one-half million dollars.  Although his assets in the United States are more 
substantial than his assets in Jordan, considering his very close connection with his family in Jordan, a security risk clearly exists.  Disqualifying Conditions <EM>(1) an immediate family member, or 
person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country,</EM> and (8)<EM> A substantial financial interest in a country, or in any 
foreign owned or operated business that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence </EM>apply<EM>.  </EM>The Applicant retains close ties with Jordan.  Based on the foregoing, under the current 
policy, the Applicant's situation raises a security concern and Guideline B is found against the Applicant.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines B and C of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has 
not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under B and C.</SPAN></P>
