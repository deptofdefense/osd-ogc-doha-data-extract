<P>Applicant's drug abuse started in 1982 with marijuana and cocaine use; he continued to use  marijuana until August 1997 when a positive drug test 
led to his termination of employment.  Nevertheless, even after he applied for a security clearance and made a commitment to himself and the 
government to remain  drug-free, he again used drugs with a co-worker in July 2000.  Applicant's marijuana use is too recent and extensive to 
demonstrate his commitment to avoid any drug use in the future despite his renewed statement of intent.  Further, Applicant minimized his drug use 
on his initial security form and has engaged in questionable personal conduct in violation of policies and regulations in his previous employment.  
Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on April 26, 2001.  The SOR 
detailed reasons why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="01-00697.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over drug abuse (Guideline H) and Personal Conduct 
(Guideline E).  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on May 21, 2001, where he admitted paragraphs 1.a., 1.b, 
1.e., 1.f., and 1.g., 2.a., 2.d.; but he denied 1.c., 1.d.., 2.b., 2. c., and 2.e.  While he provided explanations, he did not request a hearing.</P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel who on July 2, 2001, prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM)for the Applicant's review and 
advised Applicant that he had 30 days to submit objections and/or information before the FORM was submitted to an administrative judge and 
that he had the right to be represented by counsel.  A Personnel Security Specialist (PSS) sent the FORM to Applicant on July 19, 2001, and 
again notified the Applicant that he had 30 days from receipt of the letter to submit objections and/or information before the FORM was submitted 
to an administrative judge. Applicant  received the FORM on August 1, 2001, but did not respond by the August 31, 2001 deadline.  On 
September 6, 2001, the case was assigned to me.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>	</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional 
Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>     </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 37 year old employee of a defense contractor in State #1 who began work there in February 1998.  He applied for a security 
clearance in July1999 by executing a Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) (SF 86).  From November 1997 to February 1998 he 
was unemployed; from June 1991 to November 1997 he was employed by a State #1 county sheriff's department.    He was married in May 
1992 and has one child born from that marriage in November 1995; he has another child for whom he pays child support, but he was never 
married to the mother.  (Items 4, 5, 6, 7 &amp; 8)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Abuse and Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>In his SF 86 Applicant did not list his entire history of admitted use of illegal drugs; neither did he reveal the entire extent of his employment 
problems and questionable personal conduct in his initial interview with the Defense Security Service (DSS) in July 2000.  He started using 
marijuana in high school in 1982 and also tried cocaine once in 1982 because of peer pressure.  Then he smoked marijuana socially with friends 
once or twice a week from 1990 to August 1997; he usually bought marijuana every three months; he has not bought any marijuana since August 
1997.  He has not sold marijuana.  After a positive drug test in August 1997, he initially claimed to DSS that he stopped using marijuana as it cost 
him a job; and he was responsible for his young son.  He still associated with one of his friends who used drugs, but he claimed he did not see him 
as often as in the past.  While he stated in July 2000 that he did not intend to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future, after that initial 
DSS interview, he again used marijuana in July 2000 with a co-worker at the facility where he now works because he thought his "security 
clearance process was finished."  In his second DSS interview in August 2000 he again asserted that he did not intend to use any illegal drugs in 
the future.  (Items 4, 7 &amp; 8)</P> 
 
<P>Earlier Applicant was terminated by a sheriff's department where he was a civilian employee and supervised 25 after an August 1997 complaint 
alleged he brought drugs into the facility and sold them to inmates.  Applicant asserted in a July 2000 DSS interview that the allegation of bringing 
drugs into the facility was totally false; but, in fact, he later admitted in his August 2000 DSS interview that he had once in 1991 smuggled in half a 
marijuana cigarette in a cigarette package to give to an inmate.  In investigating the matter the sheriff asked Applicant to take a drug test; Applicant 
then admitted to his employer that he had used marijuana just three days earlier so that the drug test would be positive; it was.  In October 1997 
he was suspended with pay pending a hearing.  In November 1997 he received a letter of termination which cited the positive urinalysis and 
specified his taking contraband items of value from inmates; he was found not guilty of providing drugs to inmates.  He had been advised in June 
1997 by the new sheriff that drug use by employees would lead to termination.  He was found to have violated policies and regulations regarding 
employee conduct, work performance and security, and potentially to have jeopardized the safety and security of the facilities, the inmates, and the 
staff.  Also, Applicant had allowed inmates to take sugar back to their jail cells on numerous occasions even though the prison policy prohibited 
prisoners from having sugar in the cells.  He also accepted cigarette UPC codes from inmates to trade into the company for merchandise.   (Items 
4, 7, 9)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into 
conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to 
grant or continue an individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is 
not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth 
below :</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Guideline H - Drug Involvement</STRONG></CENTER>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Abuse</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's drug abuse raised security concerns as he used marijuana from 1982 to July 2000.  He also used cocaine once in 1982.  He purchased 
small amounts of marijuana from 1990 to 1997, but never sold drugs.  However, he did provide a partial marijuana cigarette to a jail inmate while 
he worked in a position of trust there in 1991.  His marijuana use included the period when he worked for a sheriff's department and led to his 
termination there in November 1997 after an August 1997 complaint that alleged he brought drugs into the facility focused attention on him, and he 
tested positive on a drug screen.  Even after he submitted his SF 86 in July 1999 and after his initial DSS interview in July 2000 where he made a 
commitment to stop using drugs, he used marijuana again  as he thought the security process was complete.  He never sought drug treatment. </P> 
 
<P>While Applicant yet again stated his decision not to use marijuana or other illegal drugs in his second DSS interview in August 2000, the recency of 
his marijuana use and the recency of the renewed commitment to drug abstinence<A HREF="01-00697.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> do not meet the mitigation<A HREF="01-00697.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN> guidelines.  First, his drug 
involvement was not an isolated or aberrational event.  In assessing the strength of his most recent decision to avoid drugs, I have looked at him as 
a whole person.   To his credit he has stopped having relationship with most of the individuals he knew when he used drugs and has made another 
commitment to stop using drugs.  However, his abstinence from marijuana is only fifteen months long which is too short when one takes into 
account the length and extent of his use.  He even continued to use after he had been advised that use of marijuana would lead to termination from 
his job in 1997 and again after he thought the security process was complete in July 2000.  Further, since he has failed to live up to a commitment 
to remain drug free, it is too soon to conclude that he has persuasively demonstrated his power to avoid any drug use for the future.  While he 
values his job, his choice to use marijuana while on a job in a sheriff's department and his decision to use again in a job requiring a security 
clearance shows deplorable judgement.  Thus, I conclude he does not meet conditions that could mitigate these security concerns over his 
marijuana use and purchase.</P> 
 
<P>On the other hand, his use of cocaine was minimal in 1982.  Thus, I conclude that this drug use can be mitigated as that drug involvement was not 
recent.  After considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I  rule against Applicant on Paragraph 1 
and subparagraph 1.a. through 1.f., but for Applicant on subparagraph 1.g.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct </STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>In completing his SF 86 Applicant had a duty to disclose all adverse information in response to the questions asked: he failed to do so with respect 
to question 24a as he minimized his drug use.  Thus conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include (2) his 
deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from his personnel security questionnaire. Applicant had a duty to 
fully disclose all relevant and material information and failed to do so. Further he showed poor judgment when as an employee of a sheriff's 
department, he violated policy for giving prisoners sugar to take to their cells and by accepting something of value from the inmates when he took 
UPC codes from inmates' cigarette packs which he traded for merchandise; thus he falls within disqualifying condition (5): A pattern of dishonesty 
or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency.  His denial of 2.e. is 
contradicted by his earlier admissions on the benefits he gained from the UPC codes in his earlier DSS statement (Item 7).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant denied allegations 2.b. and 2.c., that he falsified material facts during his second interview in August 2000 regarding a denial of having 
provided drugs to any prisoners in the jail and over shifting the month of the exact time he used drugs with a co-worker.  The only document in the 
record concerning this interview (Item 8) shows that Applicant did admit that he took an illegal drug once and gave it to an inmate in 1991.  
Applicant also disclosed that his use of marijuana with a co-worker took place in July 2000.  Thus I accept Applicant's denials of falsification on 
these two points during his second interview.  However, Applicant has failed to demonstrated he meets<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> mitigating conditions<A HREF="01-00697.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
<P> concerning the other 
falsification allegations.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>While he was later cooperative in explaining the details of his past drug use to the DSS agents, his conduct is not sufficient to fall within MC 3 as 
there is no evidence that Applicant made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the SF 86 falsification before being confronted with the facts.  
Further, he never argued that his failure to provide complete responses fell within MC 4 (Omission of material facts was caused or significantly 
contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted information was promptly and fully provided.)  
</P> 
 
<P>After considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraphs 2.a., 
2.d. and 2.e. but for him on subparagraphs 2.b. and 2.c. under SOR Paragraph 2.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER>
