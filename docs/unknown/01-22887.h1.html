<P>The Applicant and her spouse separated, but he agreed to pay their joint debts.  He did not; and as a result, she incurred in excess of $19,000 in past due 
indebtedness.  In September of 2001, the Applicant filed a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, including all of her alleged past due indebtedness in its Schedule F.  The 
Alleged past due indebtedness was discharged through this bankruptcy filing in November of 2001.  In the year following this discharge, there is no evidence of 
any recurring past due indebtedness, and she lives with her means.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 1, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on August 1, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on September 10, 2002.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received her copy on September 17, 2002, and submitted nothing further in reply.  The case was received by the undersigned 
for resolution on November 1, 2002.  The issue raised here is whether the Applicant's alleged past financial difficulties militate against the granting of a security 
clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the File of Relevant Material.  The Applicant is 34 years of age, and is 
employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant and her spouse separated in January of 1999; but prior to their separation, they were released from a $321 state tax lien (Government Exhibit 
(GX 3 at pages 3~5, and GX 4 at page 4).  As part of their separation, the Applicant's spouse agreed to pay their remaining joint debts ( GX 5 at page 2).  
However, he did not fulfill his promise; and as a result, she incurred in excess of $19,000 in past due indebtedness (<EM>id</EM>).  In September of 2001, the Applicant 
filed a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, and included all of the remaining alleged past due indebtedness in its Schedule F (GX 3 at pages 11~15).  The Alleged past due 
indebtedness was discharged through this bankruptcy filing in November of 2001 (GX 3 at page 16).  Specifically, the state tax lien and the other alleged past 
due indebtedness </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">were addressed in the following manner:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  The Applicant and her spouse were <STRONG>released</STRONG> from $321 state tax lien, for tax year 1996, in March of 1998 (GX 3 at pages 3~5).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b.  A revolving credit card debt for $3,391 was <STRONG>discharged</STRONG> by way of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in November of 2001 (GX 3 at pages 12 and 16).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c.  A department store debt for $3,158 was <STRONG>discharged</STRONG> by way of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in November of 2001 (GX 3 at pages 12 and 16).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d.  A revolving credit card debt for $3,182 was <STRONG>discharged</STRONG> by way of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in November of 2001 (GX 3 at pages 14 and 16).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e. and 1.j.  A revolving credit card debt for $1,686 was <STRONG>discharged</STRONG> by way of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in November of 2001 (GX 3 at pages 13 and 16).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f.  A revolving credit card debt for $745 was <STRONG>discharged</STRONG> by way of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in November of 2001 (GX 3 at pages 13 and 16).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.g.  A medical debt for $68 was <STRONG>discharged</STRONG> by way of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in November of 2001 (GX 3 at pages 13 and 16).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.h.  An unspecified debt for $2,783 was <STRONG>discharged</STRONG> by way of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in November of 2001 (GX 3 at pages 15 and 16).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.i.  A phone debt for $174 was <STRONG>discharged</STRONG> by way of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in November of 2001 (GX 3 at pages 14 and 16).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.k.  A revolving credit card debt for $1,260 was <STRONG>discharged</STRONG> by way of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in November of 2001 (GX 3 at pages 14 and 16).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.l.  A revolving credit card debt for about $2,181 was <STRONG>discharged</STRONG> by way of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in November of 2001 (GX 3 at pages 13~14).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the year following the discharge of her past due indebtedness, there is no evidence of any recurring past due indebtedness, and the Applicant lives within her 
means (GX 5 at pages 2~3).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has addressed all of her past due indebtedness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion, however, 
the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own 
common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions exhaust 
the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Financial Considerations</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., . . . separation);</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">6.  The individual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolved debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline F (financial considerations), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and her ability to effectively safeguard classified 
information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Government must be able to place a high 
degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Due to a separation and a spouse's failure to pay joint debts, as promised, the Applicant incurred about $19,000 in past due indebtedness, which she was 
initially unable to address.  She has now addressed all of this indebtedness, as required by the last mitigating condition under Financial Considerations; and by 
way of bankruptcy, has had all of her past due indebtedness discharged.  Since her bankruptcy, the Applicant has incurred no other outstanding indebtedness, 
and lives within her means.  As the Applicant is now financially solvent, and has been so for the past year, I conclude that her past financial considerations are 
not of present security significance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding her alleged financial difficulties.  The Applicant has thus met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline F, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, she has met her ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: FOR THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P>
