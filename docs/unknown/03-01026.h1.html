<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant was arrested for driving an automobile while intoxicated in March 1998, received a deferred prosecution, was placed on probation, and was ordered 
to undergo alcohol abuse treatment. He was diagnosed at that time as alcohol dependent, and was advised to remain abstinent from alcohol use. The same 
advice was given to him in April 2003. Despite the diagnosis and two admonitions he continued to consume alcohol until at least December 2003. Although he 
resumed attending alcoholics anonymous meetings in January 2004, it is too soon to be able to predict with any degree of certainty whether he will remain sober 
in the future. Applicant  has failed to mitigate the security concerns that arise from his alcohol consumption. Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On November 7, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to 
find it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-01026.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline G, alcohol consumption. Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR that was received by DOHA on 
November 21, 2003, requested a hearing, and admitted four of the five SOR allegations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on January 12, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on January 13, 2004, scheduling the hearing for February 4, 2004. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled.  The government submitted six documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6 and admitted 
into the record without an objection. The Applicant testified, and submitted two documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1 &amp; 2 and 
admitted into the record without an objection. The transcript was received February 12, 2004.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL MATTERS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">        </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The SOR was amended upon motion of Department Counsel to strike the word "sentence" in subparagraph 1.b. and substitute the word "prosecution" therefore. 
The amendment made clear, and Department Counsel so acknowledged, that this case did not involve any issue under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. Applicant did not object 
to the amendment. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to four of the five SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 49-year-old man who has been employed as a maintenance carpenter by a defense contractor since February 2002. He submitted two letters of 
recommendation attesting to his excellent performance in that employment. Prior to being hired by the defense contractor, Applicant worked for several other 
companies as a carpenter since at least June 1988. He is a high school graduate and has completed 42 credit hours of college work at a community college. 
Applicant was married in September 1982 and divorced in September 1992. He does not have any children.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant began drinking to excess in approximately 1978. From that time until approximately 1991 he would consume an estimated four beers four times a 
week, and would drink to the point of some degree of impairment about once a week. He began drinking more heavily in 1991/92 after his brother committed 
suicide and he was divorced. He estimates that he began drinking four to six beers about five times a week during this time, and often drank to the point of 
impairment. He has a family history of alcoholism based upon his description of his grandfather and two uncles being alcoholics. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was involved in a property damage automobile accident on March 10, 1998. On that occasion he struck a vehicle in traffic as he was exiting the 
parking lot of a tavern in which he had been drinking. His blood alcohol concentration was approximately 0.22 when he was arrested, and he was charged with 
Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI). A judgment of deferred prosecution was entered on the DUI charge on April 23, 1998, and Applicant was placed 
on probation for two years. He was also required to attend an intensive outpatient alcohol abuse program, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, pay a fine, 
and have an alcohol interlock system installed in his car. He successfully completed the alcohol program, was diagnosed as alcohol dependent, and advised to 
abstain from alcohol use. He attended AA meetings until approximately November 2000, and remained abstinent until approximately December 2001. The DUI 
charge was dismissed on March 24, 2000 based upon Applicant's successful completion of all terms of probation.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As of August 2002, Applicant estimated he might consume two beers approximately five nights a week, become impaired approximately twice a month, and 
that it would take three to four beers to cause him to become alcohol impaired. At present, he does not consider himself to be an alcoholic, but quit drinking in 
December 2003 and resumed attendance at AA meeting in January 2004 on a twice weekly basis. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant obtained a substance abuse evaluation from a physician on April 18, 2003 as part of the security clearance application procedure. He told the doctor 
during the evaluation that drinking had not caused any work interference and he did not recall ever experiencing blackouts. Records in the doctor's possession 
contradicted those assertions. Applicant informed the doctor that he questioned the prior diagnosis of alcohol dependence and felt that if he could demonstrate a 
persistent ability to drink socially he would disprove the diagnosis. Faced with the conflicting information provided by Applicant and contained in the reports, 
the doctor was still able to determine that Applicant "clearly had a substance abuse problem, could be an alcoholic, but in either count should maintain an 
alcohol free state." (GE 6) The doctor discussed his opinions with Applicant, who acknowledged the importance of his resuming an alcohol free existence and 
indicated he was accepting the recommendation as of that date. However, as noted above, he continued to drink until December 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance.  Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">a case can be measured against this policy guidance.  Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline G, pertaining to alcohol consumption, with its respective 
DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-01026.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-01026.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="03-01026.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="03-01026.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-01026.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-01026.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-01026.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-01026.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-01026.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="03-01026.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline G, alcohol consumption is a security concern because excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, 
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. Those who abuse 
alcohol are more likely than others to engage in high risk, thoughtless, and sometimes violent behavior. Recurrent use of alcohol to the point of intoxication 
may affect an individual's ability to exercise the care, judgment, and discretion necessary to protect classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was placed on a deferred prosecution, sentenced to two years probation, and ordered to attend an intensive outpatient alcohol abuse program in 1998. 
He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent while participating in the program1998, and advised to abstain from alcohol. He did maintain sobriety for more than 
two years thereafter, but in August 2002 acknowledged he was  drinking to the point of impairment approximately twice a month. In April 2003, Applicant was 
evaluated by a physician who informed him that he could be an alcoholic and recommended Applicant maintain an alcohol free state. Although Applicant 
acknowledged the need to remain alcohol free in April 2003, and indicated he would do so, he was still consuming alcohol as recently as December 2003.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is once again attending AA meetings, and had not consumed alcohol for over a month as of the date of the hearing. Although he still denies that he is 
an alcoholic, it appears that Applicant is once again making an effort to overcome his alcohol dependence. Still, based on his history, it is far too early to be 
able to make any reliable prediction that he will not resume drinking in the future. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, 
such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">applies in this case. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have considered all the Mitigating Conditions (MC) under Guideline G and none apply in this case. Specifically, MC 1<A HREF="03-01026.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> does not apply, because while 
Applicant has only one arrest for an alcohol related offense, he acknowledged that was not the only time he had driven a vehicle while impaired by alcohol 
when he was evaluated in April 2003. Additionally, the records possessed by the doctor during that evaluation also indicated there were work interference 
issues that arose from Applicant's alcohol consumption. MC 2<A HREF="03-01026.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><EM> </EM>does not apply based upon Applicant's continued consumption of alcohol, at times to the 
point of impairment, after being advised to remain alcohol free on two occasions. MC 3<A HREF="03-01026.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN> does not apply, even though Applicant has resumed attendance at 
AA meetings, because of the recency and short-duration of that attendance. Finally, MC 4<A HREF="03-01026.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> does not apply because, while Applicant once met most if not all of 
the criteria, he resumed drinking to the point of impairment and has only recently again started himself back on the path to sobriety. Guideline G is decided 
against Applicant. </P> 
 
<P>Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the 
Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find that Applicant has failed to overcome the case against him and satisfy his ultimate 
burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.   <EM> </EM>    <STRONG></STRONG></P>
