<P>Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns about his delinquent debts in excess of $38,000, which were recently discharged in bankruptcy. While most of his financial problems stemmed from a 
failed business in 2002, Applicant failed to take any tangible action on those debts until late 2005. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="05-00846.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On June 7, 2005, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns 
addressed in the Directive under Guideline F (financial considerations). Specifically, the SOR alleged Applicant owed eight delinquent debts (SOR &para;&para; 1.a - 1.h) consisting of unpaid credit accounts 
charged-off as business losses, some of which had been referred to collection agencies. The SOR also alleged Applicant has made little effort to pay his debts despite having a net monthly remainder 
after expenses of about $6,000 (SOR &para; 1.i). In his timely response to the SOR, Applicant denied with explanation all of the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </P> 
 
<P>This case was originally assigned to another administrative judge on January 3, 2006, but transferred to me on February 15, 2006. A hearing originally scheduled for March 21, 2006, was continued to 
April 25, 2006. The parties appeared as scheduled and the government presented six exhibits (Gx1 - 6). Applicant testified in his own behalf and introduced five exhibits (Ax A - E). DOHA received the 
transcript (Tr) on May 8, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 50 years old and has a degree in electrical engineering. After high school, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served from 1973 until 1977. He first received a security clearance while in the 
military and continued to hold a clearance through subsequent civilian work with government contractors through 1993. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After leaving a defense contractor position in the face of downsizing in 1993, Applicant found success in the real estate business. He eventually went into business for himself as the owner of two 
branches of a nationally-known real estate corporation. However, in 2001, the real estate business had already slowed when the attacks of September 11, 2001, had further devastating effects on that 
industry.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Sometime in 2002, Applicant was approached by someone who wished to buy Applicant's business. Applicant was offered $400,000 for his business, provided Applicant opened and conveyed to the 
buyer a third office, and that the entire business was free and clear of any claims or debts. The buyer gave Applicant $100,000 initially, of which Applicant used half to pay off the business' debts. 
However, the buyer's contribution also gave him access to the business assets as a partner. Applicant's new partner began to drain the business of cash and essentially mismanaged the business so that it 
failed. Applicant admittedly made poor decisions regarding the sale of his business and naively gave his new partner too much control over the business.<A HREF="05-00846.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He closed the business as a corporate entity on 
December 31, 2002. Thereafter, the prospective buyer disappeared and Applicant abandoned any legal remedies in May 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As a result of the failure of his real estate business, Applicant was unable to pay any of the business debts and many of his own debts. As alleged in SOR &para;&para; 1.b - 1.h, Applicant accrued at least $38,000 
in delinquent credit card, mobile phone, clothing store, and other accounts. Another collection debt for $22,772, alleged in SOR &para; 1.a, is undocumented in any of the information presented by 
Department Counsel or Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 28, 2005, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation of his personal and business debts. He declared $737,000 in liabilities against $388,000 in assets. As part of his petition, 
Applicant reaffirmed his mortgage and car payments. As his was a sole proprietorship incorporated as a subchapter S business, he felt he need not distinguish between his own debts and those directly 
related to his failed business for purposes of his bankruptcy petition. Further, filing as a business would have cost him several thousand dollars more. Applicant explained the fact he did not file for 
bankruptcy protection for almost three years after he terminated his business as a product of, alternatively, being overwhelmed by the failure of his business, lacking funds to pay attorney's fees and 
filing fees, or trying but failing to do it himself. On January 4, 2006, Applicant was relieved of the dischargeable debts listed  in his Chapter 7 petition. Except for SOR 1.a, all of the debts alleged in 
SOR &para;&para; 1.b - 1.h were discharged. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 2003, a lien for $54,000 was attached to Applicant's home as part of a lawsuit filed against Applicant as the owner of the real estate business. A similar lien for $50,000 was also attached to 
Applicant's home in July 2002.<A HREF="05-00846.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant testified both claims remain unpaid despite Applicant's bankruptcy petition, and they preclude Applicant from selling his house or using the equity in his 
house without first satisfying the liens. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was effectively unemployed from May 2003 until November 2003, when he took a job with the same defense contractor he had left in 1993. Applicant again left that company in April 2006 to 
take a job as a sales engineer.<A HREF="05-00846.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> His base salary is $60,000, but Applicant expects to earn at least an additional $40,000. Applicant and his wife have been married for nearly 20 years. She earns about 
$70,000 annually as a special education teacher for a school district near their home.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A personal financial statement appended to Applicant's signed, sworn statement to a government investigator in November 2004 showed Applicant and his wife have about $6,000  remaining each 
month after expenses. In that same statement, Applicant stated he expected to file his bankruptcy petition in "early 2005" and that his attorney had advised him to stop paying any of his past debts.<A HREF="05-00846.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="05-00846.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Security clearance decisions must reflect consideration of 
both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense 
consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive.<A HREF="05-00846.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN> The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. 
However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified 
information.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="05-00846.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to classified information. The 
government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government 
must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, the burden then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no 
one has a "right" to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="05-00846.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government 
based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect 
the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for access in favor of the 
government.<A HREF="05-00846.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations. </STRONG>The government alleged Applicant should be disqualified because he is delinquent on eight personal credit accounts (SOR &para;&para; 1.a - 1.h) totaling more than $61,000. Except 
for SOR &para; 1.a, the government presented sufficient information to support those allegations. The facts established raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline F. Specifically, an 
applicant who is financially overextended through delinquent debt and poor personal financial management may be at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds to resolve their fiscal 
difficulties.<A HREF="05-00846.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> These facts further support application of Guideline F disqualifying condition (DC) 1<A HREF="05-00846.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN> and DC 3.<A HREF="05-00846.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>The government also alleged that Applicant and his wife net about $6,000 after expenses each month, and that this would have been sufficient to enable Applicant to pay the debts alleged had he made 
an effort to do so (SOR &para; 1.i). Available information established Applicant and his wife have such funds remaining each month. However, the government did not establish, in light of all available 
information, that this constituted enough resources to resolve his debts.</P> 
 
<P>In response, the Applicant presented information sufficient to warrant application of Guideline F mitigating condition (MC) 3.<A HREF="05-00846.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN> However, the benefit he may realize from MC 3 is limited. While 
Applicant's financial problems were brought about by the failure of his business in 2002, he has not adequately explained why he waited nearly three years to pay or otherwise resolve his debts. He 
failed to act on his claim to investigators in late 2004 that he would file bankruptcy in early 2005. Instead, he waited until five months after an SOR was issued to seek bankruptcy protection. Given his 
circumstances, bankruptcy liquidation of his debts after the failure of his business in 2002 and 2003 would have been a prudent resolution of his financial difficulties. However, when combined with 
questionable decisions that contributed to the demise of his business, doubts remain about Applicant's approach to his debts. Accordingly, concerns remain about Applicant's finances and undermine 
confidence he will not again be a security risk because of future delinquencies. Indeed, despite the discharge of his debts through bankruptcy, Applicant still has not resolved more than $100,000 in liens 
against his home. Considering all of the available information about Applicant's financial problems and his efforts to resolve them, I conclude he has failed to mitigate the security concerns presented 
under Guideline F.</P> 
 
<P>A fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="05-00846.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> of Applicant's financial problems, taken in the context of all of the information before me shows that reasonable doubts persist about Applicant's ability to 
protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests. Absent substantial information to mitigate these 
doubts, which Applicant failed to provide, I cannot conclude he has otherwise overcome the government's case.</P>
