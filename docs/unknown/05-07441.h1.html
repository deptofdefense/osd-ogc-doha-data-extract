<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Forty-year-old Applicant had five alleged debts listed in the SOR. </SPAN>She established one debt was a duplication, and was conscientiously making payments on the duplicated debt. She refuted one debt, 
and it was removed from her credit report. However, she failed to adequately controvert or pay two debts, even though she had the financial resources to pay them. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In August 2004, Applicant completed

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 2, 2004, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security Clearance Application <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SF 86).<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN>On December 23, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The SOR alleges security 
concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In a sworn, notarized answer, dated January 9, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> A complete copy of the 
file of relevant material (FORM), dated April 28, 2006, was provided to her on May 8, 2006, and she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Any such submissions were due by June 7, 2006.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Applicant did not provide additional materials in response to the FORM.. The case was assigned to me on June 26, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations under Guideline F, Applicant admitted that she was responsible for paying the judgment, and she was in the process of paying it off (SOR &para;1.a.).<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  She also admitted the 
debt in SOR &para;1.d. was correct, but she contended she had paid it in December 2005.  The debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.b. and 1.e. were contested. The debt in SOR &para;1.c. was a duplication of the debt in SOR &para;1.a..</P> 
 
<P>In regard to allegations under Guideline E in SOR &para;&para; 2.a. and 2.b., she admitted she provided incorrect information on her SF 86 concerning the existence of an unpaid judgment and debts delinquent 
over 180 days. However, she denied that she deliberately provided false information. She attributed her erroneous statement to not reviewing her credit report. Her admissions are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 40-year-old<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> employee of a defense contractor,<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> She was never unemployed during the last 12 years.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> From 1996 to 1998, she attended a community college, but was not awarded a 
degree.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> She has no prior military service.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant moved to an East Coast state about six years ago.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN> At that time she was not married. She was responsible for two households because a tenant 
defaulted on a lease. She fell behind in making payments on her debts. She is seeking to obtain a security clearance. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 23, 2005, Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator. Her answers were consistent with her response to the SOR, except she stated that the debts of $234.00 and $494.00 
(described in SOR &para;&para; 1.d. and 1.e., respectively), are a duplication of the same corporate account. Her previous employer paid these debts, and is working on getting the record corrected.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> In her 
response to the SOR, she indicated that she owed and paid the debt for $234.00, and the debt for $494.00 resulted from a stolen credit card.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 23, 2005, she provided a personal financial statement (PFS) to the security investigator.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> The PSF indicates that her gross salary was $7,230.00 per month, and her husband's<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> net salary 
was $4,000.00 per month. After making all payments, including mortgage, vehicle, groceries, car expenses, utilities, credit cards, and miscellaneous, $4,828.00 per month remained. The debt section of 
the PSF included her mortgage, a home loan, an automobile loan, and three credit cards, but did not include any of the five debts that were ultimately listed on the SOR.     </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted above, on August 2, 2004, Applicant signed her SF 86. In it there were two  questions of particular significance pertaining to financial matters.  Question 37 asked: "In the last 7 years, have 
you had any judgements against you that have not been paid?" Question 38 asked: "In the last 7 years, have you ever been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?"<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> She responded "no," to both 
questions and certified that her response was true, complete, and accurate.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>  They were not.  In her affidavit of February 23, 2005, Applicant discussed her debts and the judgment, but did not elaborate 
on why she answered "no" to these two questions. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her response to the SOR on January 9, 2006, she denied the allegations of deliberate falsification. In regard to the judgment she explained, "I didn't 
request a copy of my credit file until May 2004. When I completed the application[,] the information was unbeknownst to me. I had no knowledge that the debt was listed as a judgment."<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> In regard to 
the debts delinquent over 180 days, she stated, "at the time of my application, I had no knowledge of anything being 180 days late."<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A>  At the time she completed her SF 86, she was aware that she had a 
state court judgment against her dated September 11, 2003. According to a credit report dated fifteen days after she signed her SF 86, three debts identified on the SOR were not over 180 days 
delinquent,<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> and two debts were delinquent over 180 days. The two debts delinquent over 180 days were not paid.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A></SPAN>   </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG>  In their evaluation of an Applicant's security suitability, an administrative judge should consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief</CENTER> 
 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC). An administrative judge may consider relevant 
DCs to deny or revoke and MCs to grant an Applicant's eligibility for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction with 
the factors listed in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the Directive. An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense 
decision.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.  Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine Adjudicative Process factors listed at E2.2.1 of the 
Directive: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) 
the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations - Guideline F: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to 
proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>Personal Conduct - Guideline E: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply withrules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed in 
the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent 
with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have 
avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, the government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's access to classified information. If the government meets its initial burden, the Applicant then has a heavy burden of persuasion, that is to 
present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and ultimately to demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue the Applicant's clearance.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty hours 
and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P>The scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides 
industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned." Security clearance decisions 
cover many characteristics of an Applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. </SPAN>Applicant's failure to pay her debts is of concern, especially in light of her desire to have access to the nation's secrets. The Directive 
clearly expresses the government's concern regarding financial considerations in provision E2.A6.1.1.  (<EM>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to 
generate funds</EM>.). <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect classified information.</SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's actions in failing to satisfy her outstanding financial obligations give rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. (<EM>history of not meeting financial 
obligations</EM>) and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. (<EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>). Each of the five debts listed on SOR &para;&para; 1.a. to 1.e. will be discussed briefly below.  </P> 
 
<P>For SOR &para;1.a., Applicant admitted the debt and acknowledged she fell behind in her payments. She had a monthly payment of $356.00, was $1,255.00 past due, and she owed $9,321.00.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> The 
judgment in the amount of $6,037.00 on September 11, 2003, further documents this debt. FC DC E2.A6.1.2.1. is established by her initial failure to meet her financial obligations. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant disputed the debt in SOR &para;1.b., stating that she was challenging the credit bureau report that contained the debt.  The most recent credit bureau report did not contain any mention of this 
debt.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A> The debt in SOR &para;1.b. is not established. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The debt alleged in SOR &para;1.c. is a valid, unpaid debt.  However, it is a duplication as it was sold and became part of the SOR &para;1.a. debt.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A> SOR &para;1.c. is resolved in Applicant's favor. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence establishes that the debts alleged in SOR &para;&para; 1.d. for $234.00, and 1.e. for $494.00 were reported on three credit bureau reports. Applicant said she was working to resolve them. She also 
said she paid the SOR &para;1.d. debt in December 2005, and would provide a check to verify the payment. Department Counsel in the FORM subsequently reminded her that she had not provided the check 
as promised or other information necessary to refute or resolve these debts.<A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> She did not provide the check or other evidence to support her contentions. In regard to these two debts </SPAN>FC DC 
E2.A6.1.2.1. and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. are established.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E3.1.15.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> (<EM>to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision</EM>).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden 
of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the government.<SUP><A HREF="05-07441.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SUP></SUP></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN>I considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.1. (<EM>the behavior was not recent</EM>) and FC MC  E2.A6.1.3.2. (<EM>it was an isolated incident</EM>). However, these two mitigating 
conditions are not established because <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the number of debts (three--SOR &para;&para; 1.a., 1.d., and 1.e.) </SPAN>that are recent (all currently not paid or otherwise resolved).  </P> 
 
<P>The information Applicant provided concerning the two households and the expensive move to an East Coast state, which occurred about five years ago, supported consideration of FCMC E2.A6.1.3.3. 
(<EM>the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or

Applicant remained gainfully employed throughout the entire period. She had more than sufficient time over the last five years, especially with her ample income after her marriage, to pay her 
delinquent debts. Her failure to pay or resolve these three debts, which totaled about $3,500 when she applied for her clearance,  are not caused by lack of income, or other events beyond her control. 
They are caused by her apparent unwillingness to pay or resolve her debts.  FCMC E2.A6.1.3.3. is not established for SOR &para;&para; 1.a., 1.d., and 1.e..</P> 
 
<P>Applicant conscientiously made monthly payments on the debt alleged in SOR &para;1.a., from May 13, 2002 until February 5, 2006, reducing the amount of the debt to $1,693.92 on February 5, 2006. 
Indeed, she made payments for more than two years before she applied for her security clearance. She also sought  the assistance of a debt management company, and has assiduously complied with her 
payment plan. These facts establish FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (<EM>the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control</EM>) and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. (<EM>the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>).  </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 2, 2004, Applicant </SPAN>completed a SF 86, and incorrectly answered two questionsregarding her financial matters. The SF 86 asked her whether in the last seven years she had any unpaid

"yes," to both.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P>

All she provided was her written statement that she did not intend to deliberately lie.
