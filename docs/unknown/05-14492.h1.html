<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On September 7, 2004, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security Clearance Application <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SF 86).<A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN> On January 19, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, 
and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.<A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges 
security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  </P> 
 
<P>In an answer notarized on February 7, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and asked for a hearing.<A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The case was assigned to me on October 28, 2006.  The hearing was held on 
November 21, 2006.  DOHA received the hearing record on December 8, 2006, and I received the hearing record on December 11, 2006.       </P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL RULING</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>At the hearing, Department Counsel asked for administrative notice of Exhibits (Ex.) 3 to 7, as listed on his exhibit list (R. 11-12).  U.S. Department of State publications pertaining to the Russian 
Federation are Exs. 3 to 5.  The "Annual Threat Assessment of the Director of National Intelligence," dated February 2, 2006 is Ex. 6, and an excerpt concerning the Russian Federation from 
Interagency Operational Security Support Staff's "Intelligence Threat Handbook," published June 2004 is Ex. 7.  Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for 
administrative proceedings.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004); <EM>McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  
Service</EM>, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)).  The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from government reports. <EM>See</EM> 
Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender &amp; Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice).  Applicant did not object to my consideration of Exs. 3 to 7 for purposes of 
administrative notice ( R. 12).   I took administrative notice of the facts under subheading "The Russian Federation" of this decision, which are from Exs. 3 to 7.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations, Applicant admitted the underlying facts alleged in the SOR &para;&para; 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e.<A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  For SOR &para;&para; 1.c, she explained that her father is a retired forest engineer, and for 1.d, 
she said she buys her parents presents, but does not provide annual support to them.  Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact, and her clarifying remarks about security concerns 
will be discussed in detail, <EM>infra</EM>. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 42 years old.<A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  She was born and raised in a town (T) of about 600,000 inhabitants in the Soviet Union (R. 24).  She considers herself to be Ukranian, not Russian, even though T is 
now in the Russian Federation (R. 47).  Applicant was secretly baptized in the Russian Orthodox religion when she was three-years old (R. 26). She went to a large university in Kiev, Ukraine, 
earned top grades and received a Masters Degree in computer science and systems engineering in 1987 (R. 24-25, 27, 59, 63).  After college, she worked for two years at a small software firm in 
Kiev (R. 41, 64).  She came to the U.S. in 1989 (R. 41).  She applied for a green card in 1991, and it was approved in 1995 (R. 46, 66).  From 1992 to 1994, while living in the United States, she 
used email to work remotely for a small Jewish-owned, private company located in Russia (R. 42-45, 65).  Most of the small company's employees subsequently emigrated to the United States (R. 
43-45). She became a U.S. citizen in May of 2000 (R. 66).  She was baptized as a Baptist five years ago in the United States (R. 26).  She is currently divorced (R. 51).  She has three children (R. 
27).  Her son is 16 years of age, and her twin daughters are 14 (R. 27, 48).  Her children do not speak Russian, and their friends are American children (R. 48-49).  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is currently employed as a project manager for a government contractor, and her company has employed her since May of 2001 (R. 20-21, 54).  She had an interim security clearance from 
2001 to 2005 (R. 22, 66).  Her employment involves assistance to the Navy, Air Force and the Department of Homeland Security (R. 55).  She enjoys working with military clients, and performing 
research (R. 61-62).  There were no allegations of security violations against her, or other negative judicial involvement (R. 23).  She was never a citizen of either Ukraine or Russia, having moved 
to the United States before the breakup of the Soviet Union (R. 67).  When she came to the United States in 1989, she used her Soviet Union passport (R. 67-68).  Her Soviet Union passport expired 
in 1994, she did not renew it, and she did not have any other foreign passport (R. 68).  She retained the Soviet Union passport as a souvenir (R. 92).  She has not returned to Russia or the Ukraine 
since leaving in 1989 (R. 78).  She received a U.S. passport in September of 2000 (R. 73).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has voted in U.S. elections (R. 57).  She prefers the United States over Russia because of the dishonesty and corruption of Russia (R. 58-59).  She loves the United States, its political 
system, and it is her home (R. 60).  If someone attempted to coerce her parents, she would report it to U.S. authorities (R. 60).  She loves her parents, but would not want to negotiate with someone 
attempting to coerce her (R. 61).  In any event, she would not jeopardize her livelihood and her children's welfare by violating U.S. laws (R. 61). </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's father was born in Ukraine, and is now 70 years old (R. 25, 40, 75).  He was a member of the Communist party.  However, he had difficulties with the Soviet government, which 
resulted in his leaving Ukraine and moving to T (R. 26, 85). In 1991, he gave up his Communist party membership (R. 86).  He worked the last forty years of his working life as an engineer in T (R. 
25, 77).  He assisted with resource planning (R. 29).  He traveled throughout the province near T, an area the size of West Virginia, making plans and resource evaluations (R. 35-36).  He worked 
for a provincial government office (R. 29, 39-40).  He never worked for the Soviet or Russian national government (R. 77).  Her brother, father and mother did not serve in the Soviet or Russian 
military (R. 77).  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's mother taught Russian language and literature at a middle and high school, and she is now retired (R. 36,76).  Her parents speak very little English (R. 84).  Her parents both receive a 
pension from a local government entity under the auspices of the Province of T, and are not paid by the Russian Federation government (R. 36, 76-77).  Their pensions are adequate for their living 
expenses, and Applicant's financial support is unnecessary (R. 37).   Her mother retired at the age of 52, and is now 70 years of age (R. 83).  Her parents purchased their apartment and have lived in 
it over 30 years (R. 36).  She does not provide financial support to her parents, but when they visit her she gives them gifts on an irregular basis (birthdays and Christmas) valued at about $200 per 
year (R. 37, 81-82).  She also gave her parents $1,000 for an emergency fund (R. 37).  Her parents do not plan to move to the United States (R. 37).  They are aware that she is a software engineer, 
but not that she does U.S. government work (R. 40-41).  Her parents visited her in the United States in 1999, 2001 and 2004 (R. 80).  They usually stay at her house for four to six months (R. 81).  
She does not discuss politics with her parents (R. 86).  If they became ill, she might go to visit them, although it is almost impossible for her to travel because of her responsibilities to her children 
(R. 89).  If one of her parents died, she would like the other to move to the United States and stay with her (R. 90). She communicates with her parents once or twice a month, and to her brother by 
email twice a year (R. 92).  She has not observed any indicia of pressure or coercion of herself or her parents (R. 49).  Even if her parents were threatened by Russian authorities unless she provided 
software, she would not do so (R. 94).  Instead, she would notify her security officer and police (R. 94).  Moreover, she does not believe her parents would cooperate with those making the threats 
because of their concern for Applicant's welfare (R. 96).  She does not have any foreign property (R. 96).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's brother works for a small company with about 20 employees ( R. 78).  He makes industrial automation software (R. 28, 78).  The last time she saw him was in 1989 (R. 28).  He lives in 
a suburb of a large Russian city (R. 78).  Her communications with him are limited to the exchange emails about twice a year on birthdays (R. 28-29).  However, when her parents stayed with her 
and called him, she talked to him on the telephone (R. 29).  She does not have any other relatives in Russia or the Ukraine such as uncles, aunts, or cousins (R. 84).  She has no sisters (R. 85).  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's former husband (L) is a Jewish-American citizen with a secret clearance (R. 30, 45).  He was born in Kiev (Ex. I).  Starting in 1986, they worked together for the same software firm in 
the Ukraine (R. 68; Ex. I).  They were unable to get permission to marry before he left the Soviet Union (R. 69).  In 1988, L came to America from the Soviet Union with political refugee 
immigration status, along with his mother and father (R. 45, 69).  L is currently employed working for a U.S. government contractor (R. 70). She and L were divorced in June 2001 (R. 70).  She has 
sole custody of her children, and they live with her.  L pays child support to Applicant (R. 71).  At the time of the hearing, L and his parents were staying at Applicant's  residence with her children 
(R. 71).  L's parents are U.S. citizens (R. 72).  In 2001 or 2002, L returned to Ukraine and visited his family (R. 72).  L provided a statement corroborating the information Applicant provided about 
T, and her relationship with her parents (Ex. I).  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant met a friend in Poland in 2002, who eventually moved to Kiev (R. 44).  However, she has not subsequently contacted her friend because their interests and outlooks on life have changed 
(R. 44).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant owns her home, which she received as part of the divorce decree and has lived there since 1996 (R. 51, 74).  Her equity is about 50% of the value of her residence (R. 51).  Her current 
salary is $112,000 per year (R. 52).  She invented a software application involving authentication of chat messages while she worked for a government contractor, and the U.S. government has 
primary ownership of this application (R. 52-53).  Her job and child support are her only sources of income (R. 75).</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P>The population of T has declined from 600,000 to about 400,000 (R. 30).  It is located in central Russia about more than 200 miles from Moscow, and it is slightly further to Kiev (R. 30, 32-34).   
Travel to Moscow by train from T is necessary due to the absence of roads (R. 32, 34).  Most of the terrorism in Russia occurs in the Caucasus Mountains, which is over 800 miles from T (R. 34).  
T has a very inexpensive cost of living of about $100 per month for an adult (R. 30).  The T area is economically depressed (R. 31).  There is some street crime such as automobile theft, larceny and 
robbery, but no major economic crime (R. 31, 39).  The Russian mafia is not active because there is little economic activity to exploit (R. 31, 39).  Her grandmother, who lived in T was murdered in 
1994 by a drunk neighbor looking for American dollars or other cash to purchase vodka (R. 38-39, 86-88).  The person who killed her grandmother was sent to prison (R. 88).  Ethnically T is 
Russian and Ukrainian with a small Jewish community, but no Muslim population (R. 31-32).  Exhibits G-J provide additional information about T.      </P> 
 
<P>One witness made a statement at her hearing, and Applicant provided seven written statements describing her on and off duty performance and character over many years (Ex. I, M - Q, S).  
Applicant is a highly qualified employee with unique skills, who provides an exemplary work product to her company and customers (R. 106, 108).  She has written several successful proposals, 
resulting in growth to her employer's business.  She carefully complies with company and security policies (R. 109-110).  She is a team player and voluntarily works overtime to accomplish her 
mission (R. 110).  She is reliable, courteous, honest, trustworthy and forthright (R. 110-111).  She has received a performance bonus on several occasions (R. 111).  She has strong integrity and 
values.        </P>

<P>The United States and Russia share common interests on a broad range of issues, including the drastic reduction of our strategic arsenals. We are also allies in the global war on terrorism.  Russia 
shares our basic goal of stemming the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. We are working with Russia to compel Iran to bring its nuclear programs into 
compliance with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) rules.  On North Korea, Russia is a participant in the Six-Party Talks aimed at the complete, verifiable, and irrversible dismantling of 
North Korea's nuclear program.  Russia also takes part in the Middle East Peace Process "Quartet" (along with the UN and the EU).  Russia now interacts with NATO members as an equal through 
the NATO-Russia Council but without veto power over NATO decisions.  During the past several years, Russia has intensified the efforts to combat trafficking in persons.<A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></P>

<P>In an evaluation of an applicant's security suitability, an administrative judge must consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant's eligibility 
for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.</P> 
 
<P>Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive &para; E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to the relevant adjudicative guidelines are set forth and 
discussed in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN>  Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the 
evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying 
condition under the Directive. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating 
condition.  Directive &para; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E3.1.15 provides, "The applicant is responsible </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by 
Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the 
government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).</SPAN><A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty 
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect 
or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>The scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically 
provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance 
decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Under Guideline B, </SPAN>a "security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or 
obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to 
coercion, exploitation, or pressure."  Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Two of eight possible foreign influence disqualifying conditions (FI DC) could raise a security concern in this case.  FI DC 1 applies where an "immediate family member, or a person to whom the 
individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country." Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2.1.</SPAN> "Immediate family members" include a spouse, father, 
mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.1. Applicant's father, mother, and brother are "immediate family members." The government produced substantial evidence to 
establish FI DC 1 because Applicant's mother, father and brother are Russian citizens, and they currently live in Russia.  Moreover, she has close ties of affection or obligation to them.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN>  FI DC 3 
applies where an applicant has, "relatives, cohabitatants, or associates who are connected with any foreign government." Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.3.   FI DC 3 is applicable because her parents are 
retired and receiving a pension from the local government of T.   </P> 
 
<P>Although, the mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B, if only one relative lives in a foreign country, and an 
applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR 
Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006);<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN>ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">).</SPAN>  Because FI DCs and 1 and 3 apply, Applicant has the burden to present evidence of rebuttal, 
extenuation or mitigation that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her. </P> 
 
<P>Security concerns based on foreign influence can be mitigated by showing the applicability of one or more foreign influence mitigating conditions (FI MC).  FI MC 1 recognizes that security 
concerns are reduced when there is "[a] determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not 
agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States."  
Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.1.  Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of FI MC 1, the Appeal Board has decided that Applicant must prove that his family members, cohabitant or associates 
are not agents of a foreign power, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">and</SPAN> are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force Applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United States.  
ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. July 26, 2004).  Applicant satisfies the first prong of FI MC 1 even under the Appeal Board's very broad definition of "agent of a foreign power."<A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> The 
Appeal Board has specifically indicated that receipt of a foreign pension does not cause a person to be an agent of a foreign power.<A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>   </P> 
 
<P>The second prong of FI MC 1 provides that it is potentially mitigating where the "associate(s) in question are not . . . in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the 
individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United States." The Appeal Board interprets this language as establishing an absolute standard; i.e., an applicant must 
affirmatively prove that there is <EM>no possibility </EM>that anyone might attempt to exploit or influence a foreign relative or acquaintance in the future. <EM> See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 
2006) ("[FI MC] 1 does not apply because, as is well settled, it requires that Applicant demonstrate that his relatives are not in a position which could force Applicant to choose between his loyalty 
to them and his loyalty to the United States."); ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005).  </P> 
 
<P>The nature of a Russia's government, its competitive relationship with the United States, its history of espionage against the United States, its mixed human rights record, and the prevalence of 
terrorism are all relevant in assessing the likelihood that Applicant's family members are vulnerable to coercion, persuasion, or duress.  As indicated in the statement of facts, the Russian Federation 
has a complicated relationship to the U.S.  The Appeal "Board has warned 'against reliance on overly simplistic distinctions between 'friendly' nations and 'hostile' nations when adjudicating cases 
under Guideline B,'"<A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> and Russia  cannot be labeled as "hostile" or as "friendly" to the United States.  Russia is in competition with the United States in several areas, and is likely to continue to 
engage in espionage against the United States.  Russia's future relationship with the United States may not be as congenial as it is today.  In any event, Applicant should not be placed into a position 
where she may be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and her relatives living in Russia.<A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  Additionally, a foreign government could bring pressure on her by terminating her 
parent's  pensions.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-06267 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 24, 2006); ISCR Case No. 02-30535 at 4 (App. Bd. May 4, 2005).  Thus, FI MC 1<A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> cannot be applied.  </P> 
 
<P>FI MC 3 can mitigate security concerns where "contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.3.  Applicant has frequent contacts by telephone 
and when her parents visit her family in the United States.  Additionally, she contacts her brother by email twice a year on birthdays.  She also provides irregular financial support and gifts to her 
parents. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to establish that her contacts with her parents and brother are casual.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2007).   The term "casual" means a contact that is 
"more fortuitous in nature than planned or designed" or "resulting from, or occurring by chance."  ISCR Case No. 04-08870 at 3 n.1 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006).  Arguably this definition of "casual" 
is inconsistent with the Directive, as it so narrows the applicability of FI MC 3 that it would only be applicable in very rare circumstances.  In any event, I must follow the directions of the Appeal 
Board and accordingly, I conclude that FI MC 3 cannot be applied.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant does not have any financial interests in Russia.  This fact does not mitigate the foreign influence concerns based on FI DC 1 or 3.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 04-02233 at 3 (App. Bd. May 9, 
2006).</P> 
 
<P>I conclude that no Guideline B Mitigating Conditions apply, and I expressly and specifically indicate that I have not relied "explicitly or implicitly" on any of the Mitigating Conditions listed under 
Guideline B of the Directive.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2007).  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Possession of Expired Soviet Passport</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>When she came to the United States in 1989, she used her Soviet Union passport (R. 67-68).  Her Soviet Union passport expired in 1994, she did not renew it, and she did not have any other foreign 
passport (R. 68).  She retained the Soviet Union passport as a souvenir (R. 92).  She has not returned to Russia or the Ukraine since leaving in 1989 (R. 78).  She received a U.S. passport in 
September of 2000 (R. 73).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Memorandum of Assistant Secretary of Defense Arthur L. Money, dated August 16, 2000 hereinafter "ASDC3 memorandum"</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mandates that, "consistent application of the guideline requires 
that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Appeal Board indicated in ISCR Case No. 03-10390 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005) that the ASDC3 memorandum requirement to surrender a passport also applied to expired passports.  
oreover, the passport cannot be surrendered to a Department of Defense security officer, it must be surrendered to the issuing authority.  ISCR Case No. 03-06174 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2005).  
Of course, the "issuing authority" authority in the case of the Soviet Union no longer exists.  Indeed the expired Soviet passport is a legal nullity.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There was no allegation concerning the failure to surrender the Soviet passport or any allegation under Guideline C (foreign preference) in this case.  "[T]here is no question that Applicant was 
entitled to receive reasonable notice of the reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke [her] access to classified information, as well as a reasonable opportunity to respond."  ISCR Case No. 
03-06174 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2005) (citations omitted).   Moreover, neither counsel  mentioned the issue of her expired Soviet passport in his closing argument (R. 118-144).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's counsel urged the application of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (hereinafter "Revised 
Guidelines") (R. 125-126). Under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) of the Revised Guidelines, paragraph 10 (a)(1) the first disqualifying condition states, "possession of a <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">current</SPAN> foreign passport 
(emphasis added)," effectively overruling the Appeal Board's expansive interpretation of the ASDC3 memorandum as applicable to expired passports.  The President's approval of revised 
adjudicative guidelines was forwarded in a Memorandum from the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs to the Director, Information Security Oversight Office on December 29, 
2005. This Memorandum asked the Director to, "[p]lease circulate the revised guidelines to all affected agencies for immediate implementation."  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The revised guidelines were implemented within DoD by an Under Secretary of Defense Memorandum dated August 30, 2006.  This Memorandum makes the revised Guidelines applicable to all 
adjudications and other determinations </SPAN>in which a SOR is issued after September 1, 2006, and requires that all SORs issued prior to September 1, 2006 be adjudicated under the previous Guidelines.  
Applicant's case must be adjudicated under the previous Guidelines because on January 19, 2006, Applicant's SOR was issued.  ISCR Case No. 03-17839 at 8 (App. Bd. Nov. 24, 2006) (White, J. 
separate opinion) (explaining purpose for delayed implementation is to ensure applicant's have notice of particular guidelines in effect at the time the SOR is issued).   However, assuming the 
Revised Guidelines improve and support National Security objectives, and an Applicant is not prejudiced by the change, an Applicant should be able to urge the DoD to apply the Revised 
Guidelines, when they are not inconsistent with the previous Guidelines, or when they clarify application of the Guidelines.    </P> 
 
<P>I conclude that <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the ASDC3 memorandum </SPAN>does not bar Applicant's clearance because of her possession of an expired Soviet passport.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>"Whole Person" Analysis</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under 
Directive <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">&para; E2.2.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that a Judge may find in favor of an applicant where no specific mitigating conditions apply.<A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Moreover, "[u]nder the whole person 
concept, the Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant's life separately, in a piecemeal manner.  Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant's security eligibility 
by considering the totality of an applicant's conduct and circumstances."<A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are used for "whole person" analysis.  Because foreign 
influence does not involve misconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth APF, </SPAN>"the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress," 
Directive <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">&para; E2.2.1.8,</SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.<A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In addition to the eighth APF, other "[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable 
and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Directive &para; E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance decision is "an overall common sense determination."  Directive &para; E2.2.3.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN>The Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address "evidence of an applicant's personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant's family's ties to the U.S. relative to his [or her] 
ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case." ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).  In that same decision, 
the Appeal Board commended the whole person analysis in ISCR Case No. 03-02878 at 3 (App. Bd. June 7, 2006), which provides:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has been in the U.S for twenty years and a naturalized citizen for seven.  Her husband is also a naturalized citizen, and her children are U.S. citizens by birth.  Her ties to these family 
members are stronger than her ties to family members in Taiwan.  She has significant financial interests in the U.S. , and none in Taiwan.  She testified credibly that she takes her loyalty to the U.S. 
very seriously and would defend the interests of the U.S.  Her supervisors and co-worker assess her as very loyal and trustworthy.  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Four circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis.  First, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Russia's government is a rival of the United States and in some instances has not conformed to widely accepted 
norms of human rights.  More importantly for security purposes, Russia is actively involved in espionage against the United States, and may attempt to use </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> such as Applicant for espionage. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> 
Second, Applicant had significant connections to the Soviet Union before emigrating to the United States in 1989.  She was born and educated in the Soviet Union, and a Russian firm provided her 
first post-college employment.  Third, her parents who are Russian citizens, and still live in Russia, are receiving government pensions from T.  Their pensions might be terminated to put pressure 
on Applicant.  Fourth, She has frequent and non-casual contact with her mother, father, and brother.  She provides irregular support or gifts to her parents of about $200 per year, and she gave them 
a one-time gift of $1,000 for emergencies.  These gifts and contacts with her Russian relatives are manifestations of her affection and regard for them. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There are many other countervailing, positive attributes to Applicant's life as a U.S. citizen that weigh towards granting her clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>Her Soviet passport is expired.  She has strong links or 
connections to the United States: (1) Applicant moved to the United States in 1989; (2) she became a U.S. citizen in May 2000, and she swore allegiance to the United States; (3) she has resided in 
the United States for 18 years without returning to the Russian Federation or the Ukraine; (4) the father of her three children is a U.S. citizen who resides in the United States; (5) her three children 
are U.S. citizens, and all of them reside in the United States; (6) she owns a home and has financial connections in the United States;<A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN> and (7) she has credibly stated that she would report to U.S. 
authorities any attempt to threaten or coerce her or her family members living in Russia.  There is no reason to believe that she would take any action which could cause potential harm to her U.S. 
family or to this country.  She<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is patriotic, loves the United States, and would not permit Russia to exploit her.  She has close ties to the United States.  </SPAN>Her closest family members are her three 
children.  They are U.S citizens and live with her.  Because her children live in the United States, they are not vulnerable to coercion or exploitation by a foreign power<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  </SPAN>The realistic <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">possibility of 
pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress is low.  I base this conclusion on her credible and sincere testimony, and I do not believe she would compromise national security, or otherwise comply 
with any Russian threats or coercion.  Applicant has not been to Russia since 1989, and is unlikely to return to Russia.</SPAN><A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> Her supervisors, coworkers and friends describe her as very honest, loyal, 
and trustworthy.  She volunteers for her church and is an asset to her community and company.  </P> 
 
<P>In a 2006 decision, the Appeal Board held the Judge properly determined under the "whole person" concept that an applicant with very significant connections to Russia had mitigated security 
concerns under Guideline B.  In ISCR Case No. 03-04300, 2006 DOHA Lexis 264 at *17-*21 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006),<A HREF="05-14492.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> the applicant had weekly contact with her mother (who lives in Russia), 
contact three times per year with her aunt (who lives in Russia); contact about four times per year with her father-in-law (who lives in Russia); and multiple annual contacts with other relatives 
living in Israel.  She had visited her family in Russia and Israel, on more than one occasion, after emigrating to the United States.  Moreover, she owned a half interest in her mother's apartment in 
Russia, and provided financial support to her mother and aunt.  The Judge's whole person analysis (that the Appeal Board determined was sufficient to mitigate such significant foreign influence 
security concerns) provides:<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Looking at all of [whole person] factors, I conclude Applicant has overcome foreign influence security concerns. Given her strong ties to the U.S. and her limited contact with Russia</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and Israel since 
she became a U.S. naturalized citizen, there is limited potential for coercion, exploitation or duress. (E.2.2.1.8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.)  All of her immediate 
family are in the U.S., and the majority of her financial ties are in the U.S. Applicant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG><A NAME="7996-22"></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A>has been a naturalized U.S. citizen for over fifteen years. She returned to Russia</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> in April 2005 to abjure her 
Russian citizenship and has had limited visits with her mother, aunt and father-in-law in 1995 and 2002. She provides minimal support to her mother and aunt. She has only visited her sister and 
family in Israel in 1991, 1994, and 1997. While she has contact with her relatives in Russia </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and her relatives in Israel, that contact is limited.  While her niece serves in the Israeli military, she has 
limited contact with her.  Clearly, she put her interests in the U.S. ahead of her loyalty to her elderly mother when she chose to renounce her Russian citizenship.<BR> 
<BR> 
Given her long history with her employer since April 2000, it is unlikely that she could be exploited by coercive or non-coercive means by the government in Russia</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> or in Israel in a way that could 
force Applicant to choose between loyalty to her mother, aunt, father-in-law, her sibling and family and her loyalty to the United States. She stated that should any such attempt be made she would 
immediately contact the appropriate U.S. authorities. Thus, any risk of either coercive or non-coercive foreign duress or influence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG><A NAME="7996-23"></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A>on Applicant and/or her immediate family would appear to be 
slight and clearly manageable. Contacts with citizens of other countries are relevant to security determinations only if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or 
pressure through threats against those foreign relatives.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While clearance decisions are inherently based on numerous facts, and as such are made after a case-by-case analysis, it is beyond debate that the applicant in ISCR </SPAN>Case No. 03-04300 <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">had more 
significant connections to Russia than the Applicant does in this case. Whereas, the applicant's connections to the United States connections in ISCR </SPAN>Case No. 03-04300 <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and in this case are

political activists or journalists, challenging the policies of the Russian government, or that they otherwise engage in activities which would bring attention to themselves; (7) the Russian 
government has approached any of her Russian family for any reason; (8) that Russian officials are even aware of her work for a government contractor.  As such, there is a reduced possibility that 
they would be targets for coercion or exploitation by the Russian government, which occasionally seeks to quiet those which speak out against it.  I conclude, however, that the government has no 
burden to present such evidence, and the absence of evidence does not support application of any mitigating condition, or approval of a clearance.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-21927, 2006 DOHA Lexis
