  Administrative Judge does not have jurisdiction or authority to supervise security clearance investigations, or to review or evaluate the necessity or sufficiency of such investigations.  An applicant cannot avoid the application of 10 U.S.C. 986 even if the applicant were able to identify some procedural  irregularity or failure by DoD in executing its internal regulations or procedures.  A prior favorable adjudication of Applicant's security clearance eligibility  does not bar application of 10 U.S.C. 986.  The Judge properly concluded that 10 U.S.C. 986 precluded a favorable security clearance decision in Applicant's  case.  Adverse decision affirmed.  The Board does not recommend this case for further consideration of a waiver under 10 U.S.C. 986(d).</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated August 22, 2002 which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline D 
(Sexual Behavior).  Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated June 30, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Applicant's case had been sufficiently 
investigated by the Department of Defense; (2) whether Applicant was denied due process in the proceedings below; (3) whether the Administrative Judge erred 
by concluding that 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 applied to Applicant's case; and (4) whether the Board should recommend that Applicant's case be further considered for a 
waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision, and does not recommend that this case be 
considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG><A HREF="01-19823.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Applicant's case had been sufficiently investigated by the Department of Defense</SPAN>.  The 
Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant's 1984 conviction (for which he was sentenced to two years imprisonment) falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986,<A HREF="01-19823.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and 
that application of that statute precluded a favorable security clearance decision.</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, Applicant cites to the June 7, 2001 memorandum by the Deputy Secretary of Defense which implements 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 (hereinafter "Implementing 
emorandum") and contends: "[t]he DoD failed to do a full investigation and develop a complete record upon which to evaluate whether a waiver is 
meritorious," as required by the Implementing Memorandum.  Relying on that passage from the Implementing Memorandum, Applicant argues the 
Administrative Judge erred by concluding his case had been sufficiently investigated by the Department of Defense.</P> 
 
<P>Under the Directive, an Administrative Judge has the jurisdiction and authority to adjudicate security clearance cases.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Items E3.1.7 through E3.1.26 and E3.1.35.  Nothing in the Directive gives a Judge jurisdiction or authority to supervise security clearance 
investigations or pass judgment on the necessity or sufficiency of such investigations.  Indeed, the Board has held that neither Hearing Office Judges nor this 
Board has jurisdiction or authority over  security clearance investigations.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-03112 (March 20, 2002) at p. 3 (citing prior Board 
decisions).  Although DOHA has the authority to "[d]irect further investigations" in connection with deciding whether to issue an SOR (Directive, Additional 
Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.2.1), that authority is not vested in Hearing Office Judges or the Board; and the jurisdiction and authority of Judges to make 
security clearance decisions (and the jurisdiction and authority of the Board to review such decisions) do not extend to supervising, reviewing, or controlling the 
exercise of authority under Item E3.1.2.1.<A HREF="01-19823.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Furthermore, nothing in the Implementing Memorandum gives Hearing Office Judges or the Board the jurisdiction 
or authority to supervise security clearance investigations, or to review or evaluate the necessity or sufficiency of such investigations.</P> 
 
<P>Since the sufficiency of the investigation in Applicant's case was not a matter within the jurisdiction or authority of the Administrative Judge, any statements or 
rulings by the Judge concerning that matter were <EM>ultra vires</EM> and a legal nullity.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether Applicant was denied due process in the proceedings below</SPAN>.  Applicant contends he was denied due process in the proceedings below because the 
Administrative Judge erred by concluding that DoD had complied with the provisions of the Implementing Memorandum which require a full investigation be 
conducted.</P> 
 
<P>As discussed in the Board's discussion and resolution of Applicant's first appeal issue, the Administrative Judge's statements or rulings concerning the 
sufficiency of the investigation of Applicant's case were <EM>ultra vires</EM> and a legal nullity.  Furthermore, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the 
U.S. Constitution does not create or confer jurisdiction or authority on federal administrative tribunals.  Such jurisdiction is created or conferred by federal 
statute, Executive Order, or federal regulation.  Furthermore, the Due Process Clause does not create any right to a particular procedure or remedy.  <EM>See, e.g., 
New York State National Organization for Women v. Pataki</EM>, 261 F.3d 156, 163-164 (2d Cir. 2001); <EM>Farmer v. Lane</EM>, 864 F.2d 473, 478 (7th Cir. 1988).</P> 
 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 applied to Applicant's case</SPAN>.  Applicant contends it was arbitrary, capricious, or 
contrary to law for the Administrative Judge to conclude that 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 applies to this case because: (a) she erroneously concluded DoD had conducted a 
sufficient investigation of Applicant's case; (b) without any new evidence concerning Applicant's situation, there "was no need to relitigate issues of fact and 
law that had been previously determined in a [DOHA hearing in 1986] and by this Board in 1987"; and (c) "[o]ther than [10 U.S.C. &sect;986], there must be some 
evidentiary basis for initiating this proceeding without unjustly and unfairly depriving the Applicant of his security clearance as has occurred in this case."</P> 
 
<P>(a) For the reasons given earlier in this decision, Applicant's first argument lacks merit.  Furthermore, Applicant seeks relief to which he would not be entitled 
even if the Board were to accept (solely for purposes of deciding this appeal) his theory concerning the sufficiency of the investigation of his case.  The 
applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 does not turn on whether Applicant is able to adjudicate the sufficiency of the investigation in his case.  Acceptance of 
Applicant's argument would lead to the absurd result that an applicant could avoid the application of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 if the applicant were able to identify some 
procedural irregularity or failure by DoD in executing the Implementing Memorandum.  A federal statute is not nullified or rendered inapplicable merely 
because the federal department or agency implementing that statute fails to properly execute its internal regulations or procedures.</P> 
 
<P>(b) Applicant's second argument raises the questions of (i) whether the prior favorable adjudication of his case by DOHA gives him a vested right or interest in 
continued retention of a security clearance, or (ii) whether application of the doctrines of <EM>res judicata</EM> or collateral estoppel preclude adjudication of his case 
under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P> 
 
<P>(b)(i) There is no right to a security clearance.  <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Nor does a prior favorable security clearance decision 
give rise to a vested right or interest in continued retention of a security clearance.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-21528 (July 26, 2002) at p. 3.  To the extent 
that Applicant's argument could be construed as raising the question whether DoD is equitably estopped from denying or revoking his security clearance, it is 
unpersuasive because the federal government is not equitably estopped from denying or revoking access to classified information.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 96-0461 (December 31, 1997) at p. 4 (citing prior Board decisions); DISCR Case No. 88-1733 (February 20, 1991) at p. 3 (citing federal cases).  Therefore, the 
prior favorable adjudication of Applicant's security eligibility by DOHA in 1986 and 1987 does not entitle Applicant to continued retention of a security 
clearance.</P> 
 
<P>(b)(ii) Under the doctrine of <EM>res judicata</EM>, a legal judgment precludes the parties from seeking to relitigate any claims that were adjudicated or could have been 
adjudicated in the earlier proceeding.<A HREF="01-19823.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, a legal judgment forecloses relitigation of issues that were actually and 
necessarily decided in the earlier litigation.<A HREF="01-19823.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  There are technical differences between <EM>res judicata</EM> and collateral estoppel, but those differences are not 
significant for purposes of deciding Applicant's argument in this appeal.  For purposes of this appeal, it does not matter whether Applicant's argument is 
labeled as <EM>res judicata</EM>, collateral estoppel, or a combination of both.</P> 
 
<P>The doctrines of <EM>res judicata</EM> and collateral estoppel preclude a subsequent litigation only if the controlling facts and relevant law remain unchanged; both 
doctrines are inapplicable when, between the original judgment and the subsequent litigation, there has been an intervening change in the law or a modification 
of significant facts creates new legal conditions.<A HREF="01-19823.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  In this case, the passage of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 constitutes an intervening change in the law.  Accordingly, the 
prior favorable adjudication of Applicant's security eligibility by DOHA did not preclude the Administrative Judge from applying 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 to 
Applicant's case.</P> 
 
<P>(c) Applicant's third argument also fails to demonstrate the Administrative Judge erred.  Because the passage of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 constitutes an intervening 
change in the law that justifies a new adjudication of Applicant's security eligibility, for purposes of deciding whether 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 applies it does not matter 
whether there was any new evidence concerning Applicant since the prior adjudication of his security eligibility by DOHA.</P> 
 
<P>4. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Board should recommend that Applicant's case be further considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d)</SPAN>.  Applicant argues, in the alternative, 
that the Board should recommend his case be further considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d) based on: (a) the prior favorable DOHA adjudication of 
Applicant's security clearance case in 1986 and 1987; and (b) Administrative Judge Matchinski's recommendation that his case be further considered for a 
waiver under the statute.</P> 
 
<P>In the Implementing Memorandum, the Deputy Secretary of Defense indicated: "The decision as to whether a particular case involves a meritorious case that 
would justify pursuing a request for waiver shall be the province of the DoD Component concerned (i.e. all Components authorized to grant, deny or revoke 
access to classified information) beginning with the Director of the Component Central Adjudication Facility (CAF), the Component appellate authority or 
other appropriate senior Component official."  For purposes of the Implementing Memorandum, the Director, DOHA is the Director of the Component Central 
Adjudication Facility for industrial security clearance cases.</P> 
 
<P>The Director, DOHA issued an operating instruction (dated July 10, 2001) which indicates the following:</P> 
 
<P>"Administrative Judges are responsible for initial resolution as to whether or not 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of the case."  (Operating Instruction, 
paragraph 2.e.)</P> 
 
<P>"In the event of an appeal raising an issue as to the applicability of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board is responsible for final resolution of the issue."  (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 2.f.)</P> 
 
<P>"In the event of a final determination that 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of a case, the Director is solely responsible for the discretionary decision as to 
whether to recommend to the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) that 10 U.S.C. 986 should be waived by the Secretary of Defense."  (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 2.g.)</P> 
 
<P>"If an Administrative Judge issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Administrative Judge shall include 
without explanation either the statement 'I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'I do not recommend further 
consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'"  (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.e.)</P> 
 
<P>"If the Appeal Board issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board shall include without explanation 
either the statement 'The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'The Appeal Board does not recommend 
consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'" (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.f.)</P> 
 
<P>"In any case in which [the] Administrative Judge, or [the] Appeal Board in the event of an appeal, recommends consideration of a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986, the 
Director shall within his sole discretion determine whether or not to forward the case to the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) for further consideration 
of a possible waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986 by the Secretary of Defense together with such rationale as may be requested by the Deputy General Counsel (Legal 
Counsel)."  (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.g.)</P> 
 
<P>Having addressed Applicant's claims concerning the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, all that remains for the Board to do is consider Applicant's request that it 
recommend further consideration of his case for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).</P> 
 
<P>The Operating Instruction does not authorize the Board to review an Administrative Judge's recommendation whether or not a waiver should be considered.  
Furthermore, under the Operating Instruction, the Board is not authorized to give reasons or an explanation for its decision to recommend or not recommend 
that a waiver be considered, but only state without explanation either: (1) "The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 
986" or (2) "The Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986."  Finally, since the Board is asked to make a 
recommendation in its own capacity, the Board is not bound by the recommendation made by the Judge below and must review the record evidence as a whole 
in order to fulfill its obligation to make a meaningful decision whether to recommend or not that a waiver should be considered.</P> 
 
<P>Because the Board is not authorized to review the Administrative Judge's recommendation concerning a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d), or give reasons or an 
explanation for its own recommendation concerning a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d), the Board declines to address the specific reasons Applicant contends 
should persuade the Board to make a favorable waiver recommendation.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusions</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's case falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1): "The person has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment 
for a term exceeding one year."  Accordingly, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's conclusion that 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 precluded her from making a 
favorable security clearance decision in Applicant's case.</P> 
 
<P>Recognizing the limits of its authority under the Operating Instruction, the Board has reviewed the record evidence as a whole and states the following: The 
Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P>
