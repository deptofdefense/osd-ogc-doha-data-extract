<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>In June 2002, Applicant, an American citizen by birth, married a Russian citizen with whom he still lives. Applicant's wife maintains regular contact with her 
mother, father, and brother, who are all Russian citizens and still live there. Her father is a retired Russian military officer and her brother still serves as a 
colonel in the Russian army. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline B arising from his ties of affection with foreign citizens. 
Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On April 21, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (SOR) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security 
concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The SOR informed Applicant that, based on investigative information available to the government, DOHA 
adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant's security clearance.<A HREF="03-08813.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>On May 10, 2004, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on October 12, 2004, and I convened a 
hearing in this matter on February 1, 2005.<A HREF="03-08813.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The parties appeared as scheduled and the government presented seven substantive exhibits (GE 1 through 7), 
which were admitted without objection. The government also proffered four documents for administrative notice (GE 8 - 11), and after hearing comments and 
objections from Applicant, I agreed to consider them for informational purposes. Applicant presented eight exhibits (AE A - H), which were admitted without 
objection. Applicant also presented his own testimony and that of three other witnesses. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on February 9, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in the United States and is currently employed by a defense contractor as a program manager working in software development. He served 
in the U.S. Army from 1971 until his retirement as a lieutenant colonel in 1992. During his military career, Applicant first served in the Airborne Ranger forces, 
but later switched to a specialty in logistics support and planning with the Quartermaster Corps. Applicant received the Bronze Star for his service in Operation 
Desert Storm, and has received other awards, including three meritorious service medals. After retiring from the Army, Applicant worked for three other 
defense contractors before being hired by his current employer in March 2000. Applicant has held a security clearance since 1971.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several high ranking Army officers and officials in private industry, who have known Applicant for several years, have enthusiastically recommended him for 
continued access to classified information. All of the references provided, as well as the witnesses who testified at hearing, feel Applicant is trustworthy, 
reliable, patriotic, and a man of great integrity.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was married from 1986 until his divorce in March 2001. In June 2002, he married a Russian woman he met through an on-line matchmaking service. 
She has a daughter through a previous marriage (this is her third marriage). Applicant has adopted his stepdaughter, and his wife gave birth to a second child in 
February 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his wife first began corresponding via e-mail in August 2001. The couple first met in person when Applicant traveled to Moscow in January 
2002. Applicant returned to Russia that same month to get to know her better, and again in March 2002 to meet her parents, propose marriage, and arrange to 
bring his new wife and stepdaughter to the United States. They arrived here in May 2002. Soon thereafter, Applicant's wife and stepdaughter began the process 
of becoming U.S. citizens. They are now permanent resident aliens and eligible for U.S. citizenship in 2006.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother- and father-in-law are Russian citizens who still live in that country. He is a retired Soviet Army officer who was unceremoniously retired 
from active duty in 1983. He is now elderly, socially reclusive, and in failing health. The mother-in-law is a retired utility worker. Applicant's wife calls her 
parents about twice monthly. Applicant's wife returned to Russia for a visit in June 2003, and her mother visited the United States in October 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has never met his brother-in-law, a lieutenant colonel in the Russian army teaching at a military university. Applicant's wife speaks with her brother 
about four times annually.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also had monthly on-line contact with another Russian citizen, the man who ran the matchmaking service. However, this contact ceased sometime in 
early 2002 when Applicant no longer had need of the service. In early 2003, Applicant also corresponded by e-mail with a retired Russian military officer living 
in the United States as a permanent resident alien. Applicant's wife met this person through their church. Applicant helped him edit his resume and gave him 
advice in his job search. Applicant never met this person and has had no contact with him since February 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia and the United States have had closer, less adversarial relations. However, the interests of the two nations are still 
often times at odds with each other. Russia still aims much of its intelligence resources at the United States and actively operates in all major aspects of 
intelligence collection and exploitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Russian government can now be characterized as more democratic than the Soviet regime; however, the executive branch generally wields considerable 
power unchecked by either the legislative or judicial branches. It is not surprising, then, that Russia's human rights record has not improved in the past 15 years. 
As a result of rampant organized crime, lack of law enforcement, and government corruption, average citizens in Russia are often subjected to crimes of 
extortion and outright theft by both criminals and government officials alike.<A HREF="03-08813.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="03-08813.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Security clearance 
decisions must reflect consideration of both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of 
each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines 
should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified 
information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, specifically, that Applicant has close ties of affection who are foreign citizens, I conclude the 
relevant adjudicative guideline to be applied here are Guideline B (Foreign Influence).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-08813.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted 
facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the 
Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no 
one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="03-08813.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information enters into a 
fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant 
possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with 
the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="03-08813.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>A</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that 
could result in the compromise of classified information.<A HREF="03-08813.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under Guideline B. Applicant's wife and older daughter, as well as his wife's parents 
and brother are still Russian citizens. Guideline B disqualifying condition (DC) 1<A HREF="03-08813.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. His wife's family still lives in Russia, and, because there is a 
rebuttable presumption that Applicant has ties of affection or obligation to his wife's immediate family,<A HREF="03-08813.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  DC 2<A HREF="03-08813.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> also applies here. Lastly, DC 3<A HREF="03-08813.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies 
because Applicant's brother-in-law is a senior Russian military officer. An overarching consideration in applying these disqualifiers is that Russia has a poor 
human rights record, little effective law enforcement, rampant organized crime and government corruption, and maintains an aggressive intelligence stance 
toward the U.S. These circumstances make it more likely than not that a Russian citizen with ties to an American holding a security clearance would be targeted 
for coercion in furtherance of hostile intelligence gathering efforts against the U.S. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the listed mitigating conditions (MC) apply here. MC1<A HREF="03-08813.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> fails because Applicant's brother-in-law is a senior officer in the Russian military, clearly an 
agent of a foreign power. Even without this official connection<A HREF="03-08813.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> to the Russian government, common sense dictates that the current state of Russian society and 
the Russian government's intelligence activities present a heightened risk that Applicant's in-laws are vulnerable to pressure or coercion intended to leverage 
Applicant's access to classified information. MC 3<A HREF="03-08813.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies only to the allegations in SOR &para;1.f and &para;1.g. There has been no contact with those persons in two 
to three years, and the contact was casual at best. However, Applicant's wife still maintains regular contact with her parents and, to a lesser degree, with her 
brother. Applicant's wife has returned to Russia at least once to visit her family and her mother has visited here in the past year. None of the other listed 
mitigators are relevant to these facts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As for the allegation in SOR &para;1.b, these facts have been established but have little or no independent security significance. As an allegation, it is neither 
disqualifying nor mitigating. It is simply a statement of fact that is part of the record as a whole and serves little adjudicative purpose.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under Guideline B. A fair and 
commonsense assessment<A HREF="03-08813.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> of the record before me reflects Applicant's long and distinguished service to this country, which cannot be overlooked or 
overstated. He is an accomplished military officer and has continued his service by applying his experience in the private sector in support of Army and other 
DoD efforts. The record also reflects his recently changed personal circumstances. His suitability to continue to hold the clearance </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he has held for most of his 
adult life has been appropriately reexamined in light of his new ties of affection or obligation to foreign citizens. Applicant's background now presents an 
unacceptable risk that Applicant is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">vulnerable to coercion via foreign influence.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
