<P>Applicant has been a user and sometime abuser of alcohol since age 15 and used marijuana twice a year over a five year period ending in December 2000. He 
was arrested in June 2000 and charged with driving while intoxicated and possession of marijuana. He plead not guilty and was sentenced on the driving charge 
to one year of probation. The drug charge was dropped. His probationary period was extended for six months until December 2002 for a probation violation. 
During that period he regularly attended AA by court direction and another program on his own. He has shown a profound change in his conduct and attitude as 
reflected in the evidence at the hearing and supporting documentation. Clearance is granted. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On November 5, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
<P>On December 3, 2003, Applicant, in a sworn written statement, responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The matter was 
assigned to me on April 1, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on April 19, 2004, and amended on April 28, 2004. A hearing was held on May 12, 2004. The 
Government introduced six exhibits and the Applicant introduced eleven. All exhibits were admitted into evidence. The Applicant and two other persons 
testified. The transcript was received on May 25, 2004.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor who admitted all of the allegations in the SOR but disagreed with the conclusions reached. After a 
complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record, the following additional findings of fact are made:</P> 
<P>Applicant has been a user and sometime abuser of alcohol since age 15. He experimented with cocaine and ecstasy prior to 1995 while in college. He used 
marijuana twice a year over a five year period ending in December 2000. </P> 
<P>Applicant was arrested in June, 2000 and charged with Driving While Intoxicated and possession of marijuana. He plead not guilty and was sentenced on the 
driving charge to one year of probation and fined $1,000.00 with another $1,000.00 suspended. The drug charge was nol prossed. During the probationary 
period in early 2002 he consumed alcohol in violation of a probation condition and the probationary period was extended for an additional six months until 
December 2002. </P> 
<P>Applicant was ordered by the court into Alcoholics Anonymous which he attended twice a week during a one year period after the probation violation even 
though he was required by the court to attend only once a week. During this period he voluntarily enrolled in and attended  at his personal expense another 
program that dealt with the effects of alcoholism. He was diagnosed as Episodic Abuser of Alcohol with a guarded prognosis.</P> 
<P>Applicant had a "wake-up-call" that particularly hit him hard on the occasion of his probation violation. He has changed his lifestyle and now drinks only an 
occasional beer at social occasions. He has developed new friendships, attends church regularly where he is involved with the youth ministry. He is highly 
regarded by his employers for his newly developed skills and dedication to his job. (Exhs. B-K) </P> 
<P>When completing his SF 86 on April 17, 2002, Applicant answered "No" to Question 27 regarding the use of or involvement with illegal drugs during the past 
seven years even though he used marijuana as late as December 2000. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b)</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The first allegation concerns Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1 under Guideline G of the Directive (E2.A7.1.2.1.) raises the issue of 
alcohol related incidents away from</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">work such as driving while under the influence or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use and consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment 
(E2.A7.1.2.5.). The record of Applicant's</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">two offenses, convictions, and sentences clearly show that the Government has established reasons to deny him a security clearance because of alcohol abuse 
under Guideline G. Mitigating conditions are applicable in that Applicant has shown that the problems with abuse of alcohol ended four years ago and that there 
is no indication of a recent problem. (E2.A7.1.3.2.) Evidence was submitted of positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety. (E2.A7.1.3.3.) <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has cited Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1 under Guideline H in the SOR concerning drug involvement as relevant to the proposed denial of a 
security clearance for the Applicant. Drug involvement is always a security concern because it raises questions about a person's willingness or ability to protect 
classified information. Any drug abuse is a condition that may be disqualifying. The following definition is provided: "Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug . . 
. ." (E2.A8.1.1.3) Applicant has not used drugs for four years and is a stable member of society. Mitigating Conditions are applicable since there is a 
demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future (E2.A8.1.3.3.), and the drug involvement was not recent. (E2.A8.1.3.1.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Also alleged is Applicant's failure to report certain of the offenses under Guideline E that might indicate questionable judgment, unreliability, and 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information (E2.A5.1.1.). 
Specifically, the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a personnel security application could raise a security 
concern and be disqualifying. (E2.A5.1.2.2.) Applicant offered as an explanation for his failure to acknowledge the use of drugs on the SF 86 that he interpreted 
the question as relating the criminal charge of marijuana possession and, since the charge had been nol prossed, it was not required to be listed. Based on his 
demeanor and the reason advanced for the omission, I conclude that the omission was not deliberate as required in the guideline.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The "whole person" concept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits 
taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant has shown by his testimony 
and appearance at the hearing as well as his supporting statements from supervisors and colleagues, that he has changed his conduct in the last four years and is 
a reliable, trustworthy, and credible person. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that the Applicant has changed 
his habits sufficiently that the allegations in the SOR have been mitigated. Although he did not exhibit the care required for preparing the application for a 
security clearance he advanced a credible explanation to justify the granting of a clearance.</SPAN></P>
