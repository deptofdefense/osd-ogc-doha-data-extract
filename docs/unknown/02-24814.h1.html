<P>Applicant has failed to mitigate two false answers on his security clearance application, both as Personal Conduct under Guideline E and Criminal Conduct 
under Guideline J.  Applicant omitted his DWI and DUI convictions, as well as a drug-related arrest from his security clearance application.  He contends the 
omission was not deliberate but was due to him reading the application to only cover the last seven years.  His argument is not convincing.  In addition to the 
fact that the application required him to disclose all of his alcohol and drug offenses,  Applicant omitted the drug-related arrest that occurred within the prior 
seven years.  His admission of drug use on the application also fails to establish that his omission of the drug-related arrest was not deliberate.  Clearance is 
denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On April 30, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-24814.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-24814.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
issued a Statement Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR details security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct).  The SOR states that DOHA was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified information and 
recommends that his case be submitted to an Administrative Judge.</P> 
 
<P>On June 9, 2003, DOHA received Applicant's response to the SOR, including a request for a hearing.  On August 26, 2003,  Applicant  withdrew his request 
for a hearing and requested a decision on the written record, in lieu of a hearing.  On September 26, 2003, Applicant received the File of Relevant Material 
(FORM), which contains 11 documents.  On October 24, 2003, Applicant submitted comments on the FORM.  The case was assigned to me on November 6, 
2003.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 4-year-old test engineer, who is employed by a defense contractor.  He is seeking a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>On November 2, 1984, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While Under the Influence of Alcohol(DUI).  He was fined $350.00 for the offense 
and ordered to attend DUI educational classes and counseling.<A HREF="02-24814.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>On December 8, 1985, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) and A Stop Sign Violation.  He was fined $350.00 and 
sentenced to 30 days in jail, which was suspended.<A HREF="02-24814.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>On May 20, 1998, Applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of Drug Paraphernalia.  He pleaded no contest and he was placed on probation for 6 
months.  The case was closed on September 16, 1999.<A HREF="02-24814.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>On October 4, 2001, Applicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86) that was submitted on March 3, 2002.  In response to question 24,<A HREF="02-24814.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Applicant 
answered, "no,"and omitted all of his criminal offenses.<A HREF="02-24814.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In response to question 26<A HREF="02-24814.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> on the same SF 86, Applicant answered, "no," and omitted his drug-related offense.<A HREF="02-24814.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>On July 1, 2002, Applicant provided a sworn statement to the special agent for the Defense Security Service (DSS) who conducted his background 
investigation.  Applicant admitted his DUI and DWI convictions and his drug-related arrest.<A HREF="02-24814.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel is responsible for presenting evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR.  Directive E3.1.14.  The applicant is responsible for 
presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of 
persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.  Directive E3.1.15.</P> 
 
<P>Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon an individual meeting adjudicative guidelines discussed in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  An 
evaluation of whether an  applicant meets these guidelines also includes the consideration of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept."  
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a decision. This assessment 
should include the following factors:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion,</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with 
national security will be resolved in favor of national security.  Directive E2.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 provides conditions for each guideline that could raise a concern and may be disqualifying, as well as further conditions that could mitigate a 
concern and support granting a clearance.  The following guidelines are applicable to this case.</P> 
 
<P>Guideline E: Personal Conduct</P> 
 
<P>Guideline E, Personal Conduct, concerns conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that could indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Conditions that could  
raise a security concern and may be disqualifying under Guideline E include E2.A5.1.2.2 (Disqualifying Condition 2).  Disqualifying Condition 2 addresses the 
deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar 
form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, 
or award fiduciary responsibilities. </P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include E2.A5.1.3.3, the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being 
confronted by the facts.</P> 
 
<P>Guideline J: Criminal Conduct</P> 
 
<P>The concern under Guideline J is a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  Conditions 
that could  raise a security concern and may be disqualifying under Guideline J include  E2.A10.1.2.1, allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless 
of whether the person was formally charged (Disqualifying Condition 1).</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include E2.A10.1.3.1, the criminal behavior  was not recent (Mitigating Condition 1) and E2.A10.1.3.2, the 
crime was an isolated incident (Mitigating Condition 2). </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Guideline E: Personal Conduct</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's failure to disclose his DUI and DWI convictions and arrest for Possession of Drug Paraphernalia in response to question 24 on his security 
clearance application (SOR &para; 1.) raises Disqualifying Condition 2.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant contends that his failure to list his alcohol-related convictions was not deliberate.  He claims to have misread the security clearance application so as 
to limit responses to the last seven years.   However, question 24 is unequivocal: "Have you <EM>ever</EM> been charged or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol 
or drugs?"  (Emphasis added.)  Moreover, even if question 24 is read so as to be limited to the last seven years, this is of dubious value to Applicant's 
contention, because he omitted his drug-related arrest that occurred within the seven year period. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant addresses his failure to disclose his drug-related arrest in response to question 24 by emphasizing that he disclosed his use of marijuana in response to 
question 27.  Applicant argues that this demonstrates that he was not attempting to conceal his drug involvement.  However, Applicant's disclosure of a limited 
use of marijuana does not establish that he was not attempting to suppress the criminal consequences of his behavior.  Moreover, Applicant does not 
specifically address SOR &para; 1.b, which identifies his additional failure to report his drug-related arrest in response to question 26.</P> 
 
<P>Had Applicant disclosed his drug-related arrest in response to question 24, his "no" answer to question 26 would have been appropriate.  Since he failed to do 
so, however, Applicant was confronted with a second question requiring him to disclose the information, because it  required the disclosure of any arrests or 
convictions within the last seven years that he had not previously provided. By having submitted a false answer to question 24, Applicant provided a second 
false answer when he answered, "no," to question 26.  This also establishes Disqualifying Condition 2. </P> 
 
<P>With regard to mitigation, the record does not support Applicant's argument that he made a prompt good faith effort to correct any falsification before being 
confronted with the facts. Applicant did not admit his criminal conduct until nearly nine months after submitting his security clearance application.  
Furthermore, he only did so when a security investigator confronted him with the results of his investigation.  These facts fail to meet the criteria required by 
itigating Condition 3.  With regard to Applicant's credibility, I have considered the affidavits of four affiants, who attest to his good character.  However, 
their assessments fail to convince me that Applicant's omissions from his security clearance application were not deliberate, in light of the other evidence of 
record discussed above.  I find against Applicant under both SOR &para; 1.a and &para; 1.b. of Guideline E. </P> 
 
<P>Guideline J: Criminal Conduct</P> 
 
<P>Even though he has not been charged, Applicant's deliberate omissions in response to questions 24 and 26 on his security clearance application constitute 
criminal violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001.  This establishes Disqualifying Condition 1.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant misconstrues the Guideline J allegation by arguing that his DWI convictions are not recent.  It is not those convictions or his drug-related arrest 
which is the basis for that allegation.  That allegation is attributable to his false statements on his security clearance application.  That criminal conduct is 
recent.  It also is not an isolated incident.  Even though his alcohol-related convictions and drug-related arrest are not alleged under Guideline J, they are 
established by the record.  They demonstrate Applicant's recent falsifications are not isolated criminal conduct.  The fact that other persons find Applicant 
reliable and trustworthy is not sufficient to mitigate his offenses evidenced by the record.  Accordingly, I find against Applicant under Guideline J.   </P>
