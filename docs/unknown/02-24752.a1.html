<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On August 18, 2004, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On February 23, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Michael H. 
Leonard denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline B is arbitrary, capricious or 
contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant contends that the Administrative Judge's unfavorable clearance decision should be reversed because it is Applicant's wife's family members, not his 
family members, that are citizens and residents of the People's Republic of China (PRC).  Applicant also argues that his evidence was sufficient, as a matter of 
law, to demonstrate that his wife's family members were not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force him to choose between 
loyalty to them and the United States.<A HREF="02-24752.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  The Board does not find Applicant's arguments persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant had the burden of presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate facts that the Department Counsel proved or that Applicant 
admitted regarding his family ties to the PRC, and the Applicant also had the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security clearance 
decision. Directive &para; E3.1.15.  The Administrative Judge had to consider the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate the facts and 
circumstances of Applicant's past  and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide whether Applicant had met his burden 
of persuasion under Directive &para; Item E3.1.15. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The fact that Applicant's explanations and his mitigating evidence did not lead the Administrative Judge to the decision desired by Applicant does not establish 
error.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the 
Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice versa</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.  An applicant's 
disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the 
Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A review of the Administrative Judge's decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the 
disqualifying circumstances, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.  The Judge articulated a rational basis for not 
favorably applying any mitigating conditions or factors and reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was 
insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  Foreign connections not based on birth can raise security concerns under Guideline B.  Therefore, 
the Judge's decision is not rendered arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law because Applicant's relationships with PRC citizens are based on his marriage. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, 
e.g.</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Whether Applicant's wife is eligible or not eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship now or in the 
future does not change the fact that she is now a PRC citizen and not a U.S. citizen, and does not change the security significance of those facts for purposes of 
adjudicating Applicant's current security eligibility.  Even if Applicant's wife were to become a naturalized U.S. citizen in the future, such a circumstance does 
not render the Judge's decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, considering Applicant's ties to his wife's immediate family members who are citizens 
and residents of the PRC.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.</EM>, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ISCR Case No. 02-30535 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 4, 2005).  Given the record that was before him, the Judge's ultimate 
unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline B is sustainable.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Finally, Applicant cites several decisions by Hearing Office Administrative Judges in other cases, arguing that the favorable results in those cases constitute a 
reason for reversing the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision in his case.  A decision by a Hearing Office Judge is not legally binding precedent on 
other Hearing Office Judges or the Board.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-22606 at 3-5 (App. Bd. June 30, 2003).  Accordingly, Applicant's ability to cite Hearing 
Office decisions in other cases that appear to support his position does not demonstrate the Judge's decision in this case is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to 
law.  Furthermore, the Board has no obligation to follow the Hearing Office decisions cited by Applicant, and no obligation to reconcile the Judge's decision 
below with the Hearing Office decisions cited by Applicant.</SPAN></P>
