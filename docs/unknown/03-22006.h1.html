<P>Applicant is a 56-year-old naturalized citizen of the United States.  He was born in South Vietnam, and was an officer in the South Vietnamese Navy until the 
country was overrun by the communists in 1975.  Applicant escaped to the United States, graduated from college here, and has worked for a defense contractor 
for 23 years.<STRONG>  </STRONG>One of Applicant's brothers and three of his sisters still live in Vietnam.  Applicant has not spoken to these sisters since he left Vietnam in 1975, 
however he writes to them once or twice each year and sends small monetary gifts.  Applicant speaks to his brother by telephone several times a year.  
Applicant has extensive ties to the United States, including his spouse, two brothers, and substantial financial interests.  Applicant has mitigated the security 
concerns arising from the possible foreign influence.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On May 24, 2000, Applicant submitted a security clearance application.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, 
and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (the 
"Directive").  On May 14, 2004, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.  The SOR alleges security concerns raised 
under the Directive, Guideline B, Foreign Influence.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on May 27, 2004.  He elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.</P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to me on August 11, 2004.  With the concurrence of the parties, I conducted the hearing on September 22, 2004.  The government 
presented three documents.  Applicant's counsel presented four documents and Applicant testified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript on 
October 12, 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted the factual allegations in &para;&para; 1.a and 1.b of the SOR.  Applicant's Answer to SOR, dated May 27, 2004.  Those admissions are incorporated

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In Executive Order 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM>, &sect; 3.1(b) (August 4, 1995), the President provided that eligibility for access to classified 
information shall be granted only to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength 
of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, 
and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  A person granted access to classified 
information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those 
individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of 
the applicant.  Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a 
clearance.</P> 
 
<P>To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in 
this case are: </P> 
 
<P>Guideline <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">B, Foreign Influence:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, or other persons to whom he may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries 
are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</P> 
 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, 
reliable information about the person. <EM> Id.</EM>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age 
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
<EM>Id.</EM>  <BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.  Directive, &para; E3.1.14.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  Directive, &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent 
with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive, &para; E2.2.2. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR. </P> 
 
<P>The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions constitute substantial evidence of a potentially disqualifying condition under Guideline B of the 
Directive.  Paragraph E2.A2.1.2.1 provides that it may be a disqualifying condition if "an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has 
close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country<EM>.</EM>"  Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1. defines "immediate family members" to 
include a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.  The evidence indicates that Applicant has a brother and three sisters who are citizens 
and residents of Vietnam.  Applicant maintains regular, although somewhat sporadic, contact with his brother.</P> 
 
<P>These circumstances "could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information."  Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1.  
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mere possession of family ties with persons in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, automatically disqualifying . . . [it] does raise a prima facie security 
concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></SPAN></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for the applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 at **33-34 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).</SPAN>  </P> 
 
<P>These security concerns can be mitigated where it is determined that "the immediate family members . . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be 
exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United States."  Directive, &para; 
E2.A2.1.3.1.  In this case, none of Applicant's brother or sisters in Vietnam have any connection to the government or a political party.  Thus none of them are 
an "agent of a foreign power."  <EM>See</EM> 50 U.S.C.A. &sect; 1801(b).<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><EM></EM>In assessing whether relatives are vulnerable to exploitation, it is helpful to consider several factors, including the character of the government of the relevant 
foreign country.  Vietnam is a communist country.  Ex. 3 at 1, 13.  For more than a decade after the war, Vietnam and the United States had no economic or 
political relations.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 1.  Since 1985, both countries have taken significant steps toward normalizing relations through trade agreements and other political 
and security initiatives.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 4-7.  Vietnam is still dominated by the Communist party and its government is intolerant of dissent.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 13<EM>.</EM>  Vietnam has a 
poor record of protecting human rights.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 10.  Under the circumstances, the possibility exists that the government would attempt to exploit or pressure its 
residents to act adversely to the interests of the United States.<EM></EM></P> 
 
<P>It is important to consider the vulnerability to duress of Applicant's relatives in Vietnam.<STRONG>  </STRONG>As noted above, Applicant's brother and sisters are not and have 
never been employed by the government or the military of the present government of Vietnam, nor do any of them rely upon a government pension.  Each of 
them operate an independent family business.  Applicant's sisters are not well-off financially, making them somewhat more vulnerable.  His brother's financial 
position is such that he can travel abroad if desired.  Under these circumstances, the opportunity for adverse influence is substantially reduced.<STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Another significant factor is Applicant's vulnerability to pressure or duress applied indirectly through his ties with his relatives.  Applicant has little contact 
with his sisters in Vietnam-he has not spoken to any of them since he left the country in 1975.  He maintains regular contact with his brother, however.  At the 
same time, he has extensive ties to the United States.  Applicant has now lived here most of his adult life, his spouse is a citizen and resident of the U.S., and 
many of his family members live here.  All his financial interests are in the United States.  He has worked for this defense contractor for over 23 years and has 
substantial professional and financial ties to the company.  Applicant held a security clearance from 1984 to 1991 without adverse incident.  Finally, when 
confronted with the possibility of improper foreign influence, Applicant wrote, "I can honestly say that my loyalty lies with the United States.  I am very anti-Communist and I would defend this country if called upon to do so, as I have done in the past."  Ex. 2 at 4.  Considering the extent of his ties to the United 
States, I find Applicant is not vulnerable to pressure or duress.  I conclude the mitigating condition set out in &para; E2.A2.1.3.1 of the Directive applies.<STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under &para; E2.A2.1.3.3 of the Directive, it may also be mitigating where "[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent."  
Applicant has very little contact with his sisters in Vietnam.  As mentioned above, he has not spoken to them since he left the country in 1975, and corresponds 
only once or twice each year.  "Nothing in the plain language of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 3 precludes its application to an applicant's immediate 
family members.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0552 (May 4, 1999) at 7."  ISCR Case No. 00-0484 (February 1, 2002), 2002 DOHA LEXIS 85.  I find 
Applicant has only casual and infrequent contact with his sisters in Vietnam.</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1.c of the SOR alleges Applicant planned to travel to Vietnam in December 2003.  While that was true at the time, Applicant never made the trip.  
He is not planning to visit Vietnam in the future.  </P> 
 
<P><EM></EM>I considered carefully all the facts and circumstances in this case.  I conclude Applicant has mitigated any potential security concerns arising from Applicant's 
family ties to Vietnam.</P>
