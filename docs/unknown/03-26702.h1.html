<P>Applicant was arrested in 2000 after being given a field sobriety test and in 2003 for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). As a result, he was convicted 
of an unknown offense in 2000 and DUI in 2003. Applicant made positive changes supportive of sobriety and has not had any alcohol-related incidents in more 
than three years. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. In accordance with Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 &para; E3.1.2 (Jan 2. 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 9 September 2005 detailing the basis for its 
decision-security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 5 October 2005 and 
elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 28 November 2005. On 22 February 2006, I convened a hearing to 
consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript 
(Tr.) on 3 March 2006.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 33-year-old data manager (senior analyst) for a defense contractor. Applicant is six feet-two inches tall and weighs 220 pounds. Ex. 1 at 1. Since 
he began his current employment he has met or exceeded all standards of performance. Exs. A, B. He currently resides with his fianc&eacute;e in her parent's home. 
Tr. 34.</P> 
<P>In June 2000, Applicant drove his sister and his girlfriend home from a concert, at which, according to his testimony, he had consumed a total of three 
beers-one before the concert and two during the three-hour concert. Tr. 39-40. On the way home, Applicant was stopped by police. He believes it was for 
"swerving" or "driving erratically." Tr. 41. He was given field sobriety tests. The police officer then took Applicant to the station. His girlfriend had to drive his 
sister home. He was eventually charged with an offense, but asserts he is unsure of the exact charge. At trial, he was represented by an attorney. He pled guilty 
to an offense; he testified he thinks his guilty plea was to reckless driving, but he is not sure. Tr. 44; Ex. 3 at 2-3. His driving privileges were revoked in that 
state for six months.</P> 
<P>Applicant went to work for the defense contractor in November 2002. On 4 December 2002, he completed a security clearance application (SCA) by certifying 
that his answers were "true, complete, and correct" to the best of his knowledge and belief and acknowledging that a knowing and willful false statement could 
be punished by fine and/or imprisonment. Ex. 2 at 9. Question 24 asked if Applicant had ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol. 
Applicant answered "yes," and listed a June 2000 DUI (driving under the influence of alcohol) that resulted in "loss of license for 6 months." Ex. 2 at 7.</P> 
<P>In January 2003, Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI). He and a friend, Rob, had gone to a club to see friends and listen to a band. Rob 
drove and was to be the designated driver. Applicant testified he consumed approximately five beers between 8:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. He wanted to leave, but 
found Rob was intoxicated and in no condition to drive home. So Applicant drove to a diner where they had food and coffee. After about an hour and one-half, 
Applicant started the drive home. About an hour later, shortly before he arrived home, Applicant was stopped by police "due to erratic driving patterns." Ex. 3 
at 2. The officer smelled alcohol on Applicant's breath and had him perform field sobriety tests. Applicant failed the tests and was arrested for DUI. In March 
2003, Applicant pled guilty and was convicted of DUI. His driver's license was revoked for six months; he was also fined, and ordered to attend a two-day, 
twelve-hour alcohol education course. <EM>Id.</EM>; Tr. 48-60.</P> 
<P>In October 2003, Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) concerning his SCA. Apparently, based on 
Applicant's SCA, the DSS agent had investigated Applicant's record and found no evidence he had ever been arrested for or convicted of DUI in 2000. After 
being so advised, Applicant completed a signed, sworn statement in which he stated that to the best of his knowledge he had not been arrested in May 2000 for 
driving while intoxicated (DWI), but was issued a "summons for reckless driving." Ex. 3 at 3. </P> 
<P>In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant "agreed" with the allegation in the SOR &para; 1.b that he had been "arrested in June 2000 . . . and charged with Driving Under 
the Influence," but disagreed that his driver's license was revoked for six months. At the hearing, Applicant was unsure of what he was arrested for, charged 
with, or convicted of.</P> 
<P>Since his 2003 arrest, he has had no alcohol-related arrests or incidents. On occasion he does have a beer or a glass of wine with dinner. He does not drink if he 
is going to drive.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication from at least 2000 to October 2003 (&para; 1.a); was arrested in June 2000 for 
DUI and consequently had his driver's license revoked for six months (&para; 1.b); and pled guilty to DUI after a January 2003 arrest (&para; 1.c). In his answer, 
Applicant denied he drinks to excess; denied his driver's license had been revoked for six months as a result of his June 2000 arrest; but agreed with the rest of 
the allegations. Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the 
risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Directive &para; E2.A7.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The state of the evidence in this case raises issues regarding the burden of proof. Applicant admitted in his SCA that he had been charged with or convicted of 
DUI in June 2000. In his Answer, he admitted being arrested for and charged with DUI. But in his statement to the DIS agent and at the hearing, he claimed he 
was not sure what he was charged with or convicted of on that occasion, but he did not think it was DUI. In such a case, who has the burden of establishing 
whether he was charged with or convicted of DUI as alleged in the SOR?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant is required to "submit a detailed written answer to the SOR . . . that shall admit or deny each listed allegation." Directive &para; E3.1.4. At the hearing, 
"Department Counsel is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted." Directive &para; 
E3.1.14. "The applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or 
proven by Department Counsel." Directive &para; E3.1.15.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> To the extent an applicant's answer admits an SOR allegation, there is no controverted allegations which 
Department Counsel had the burden of proving. ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 WL 675725 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001) (citing Directive &para; E3.1.14).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After carefully considering all of the evidence, I conclude the evidence is sufficient to show Applicant was arrested for DUI in June 2000. Regardless, the issue 
in this case is whether Applicant was involved in an alcohol-related incident. I conclude he was.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence established potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline G</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant drank to the point of intoxication between 2000 and 
2003 and was involved in two alcohol-related incidents away from work. It is potentially disqualifying for an applicant to be involved in alcohol-related 
incidents away from work. DC E2.A7.1.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant may mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns by demonstrating that the alcohol-related incidents occurred a number of years ago and there 
is no indication of a recent problem (MC E2.A7.1.3.2), and he has made positive changes supportive of sobriety (MC E2.A7.1.3.3). After carefully reviewing 
all of the evidence, the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, as well as the adjudicative process factors, I find for Applicant. There were two incidents in a 
three-year period and the last incident was more than three years ago. Applicant has matured, is committed to sobriety, and does not drink and drive any more. 
He understands the seriousness of excessive alcohol consumption and its possible ramifications on his ability to maintain a security clearance. Under the 
circumstances, I find for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
