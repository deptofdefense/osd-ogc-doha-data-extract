<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>SYNOPSIS<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted her use of marijuana over a 31 year period on her security clearance application.  However, the record establishes she has not used it for 
over three years and demonstrates her intent never to use it again.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On November 5, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-29338.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense 
Directive,<A HREF="02-29338.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> issued a Statement Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR details security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement).  The SOR states that 
DOHA was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to classified information and recommends that her case be 
submitted to an Administrative Judge.</P> 
 
<P>On November 20, 2003, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on February 3, 2004.  A notice of hearing was 
issued on March 16, 2004 and the hearing was held on April 15, 2004.  During the hearing, two Government exhibits (Govt Ex), four Applicant exhibits (Ap 
Ex), and the testimony of two Applicant witnesses, including Applicant, were received.  Subsequent to the hearing and with no objection from Department 
Counsel, Applicant submitted evidence of her completion of an alcohol and drug education program.  I have marked the same as Applicant Exhibit E and 
included it in the file.  The transcript (Tr) was received on April 23, 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's admission to all SOR allegations, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 51-year-old computational linguist employed by a government contractor.  She is knowledgeable with regard to Arabic languages and has 
received awards for her job performance.</P> 
 
<P>On or about January 1970, Applicant began smoking marijuana at the age of 16 while in high school.  Although there were periods of time it was not available 
to her or she did not choose to use it, such as during her pregnancies, she continued to use marijuana until June 2001.<A HREF="02-29338.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  At times, Applicant purchased 
marijuana.  From August 1988 until June 2001, she used marijuana on a regular basis, two or three times per week.  At the time, Applicant was an associate 
professor at a university. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has not used marijuana since she left her teaching position at a university and moved to the east coast in June 2001.  </P> 
 
<P>On February 2, 2002, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86).  She admitted her marijuana use from January 1970 until June 26, 2001.</P> 
 
<P>On March 19, 2002, Applicant provided a sworn statement to a Defense Security Service (DSS) investigator regarding her use of marijuana.  She concluded: "I 
do not intend to use it as long as I have the responsibility of maintaining a security clearance."</P> 
 
<P>On April 29,2004, Applicant voluntarily completed a 12 hour alcohol and drug education program.  She received an evaluation of excellent for her attitude, 
participation, attendance, sobriety, and AA attendance.  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish  facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  Directive 
E3.1.14.  The applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or 
proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.  Directive E3.1.15.</P> 
 
<P>Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon an individual meeting adjudicative guidelines discussed in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  An 
evaluation of whether an applicant meets these guidelines includes the consideration of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept."  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a decision. This assessment should include 
the following factors:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of 
participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is 
clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of national security.  Directive E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 provides conditions for each guideline that could raise a concern and may be disqualifying, as well as further conditions that could mitigate a 
concern and support granting a clearance.  The following guideline is applicable to this case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline H: Drug Involvement</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The concern under Guideline H is that improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect 
classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could  raise a security concern and may be disqualifying under Guideline H include E2.A8.1.2.1, any drug abuse (Disqualifying Condition 1).  
Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include E2.A8.1.3.1, the drug involvement was not recent.  They also include: E2.A8.1.3.3, a demonstrated 
intent not to abuse any drugs in the future (Mitigating Condition 3); and </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A8.1.3.4, satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, 
and a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional (Mitigating Condition 4).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admitted marijuana use over a 31 year period raises Disqualifying Condition 1.  She forthrightly admitted her marijuana use on her security 
clearance application.  However, Applicant denies any use of marijuana since she decided to quit using it in June 2001.  Moreover, there is no evidence in the 
record of any recent marijuana use on her part.  Therefore, the record supports the application of Mitigating Condition 1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant has successfully completed an alcohol and drug education program, the evidence of record with regard to this program is not sufficient to 
establish Mitigating Condition 4.  For example, the is no evidence of record of the credentials of the counselor who provided an evaluation of Applicant.  See 
ISCR Case No. 98-0198 (November 17, 1998) at p. 3.  However, Applicant successful completion of the program is consistent with her expressed intent to 
never use marijuana again. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because of her statement to the DSS investigator, there is concern reflected in the SOR that Applicant may resume her marijuana use if she no longer needs a 
security clearance.  As Applicant explained in her testimony, however, she did not intend to suggest she might ever resume the use of marijuana.  Moreover, 
Applicant's decision to stop using marijuana was not solely driven by the expectancy of needing a security clearance.  She was concerned with setting a bad 
example for her children who were reaching their teen age years.  Applicant also was becoming increasingly mindful of the adverse impact that marijuana 
smoking was having on her health.  Her change in location presented the opportunity for a fresh start.  In the three years since that move, Applicant has 
demonstrated an intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.  Moreover, the information that Applicant acquired from an alcohol and drug education program 
would appear to have reinforced the health concern that caused her to stop smoking marijuana.  Accordingly, the record supports the application of Mitigating 
Condition 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Despite the length of applicant's marijuana use, the record demonstrates that it is in her past and not in her future.  On that basis, I find in favor of Applicant. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:</SPAN></P>
