<P>Applicant was involved in a mutual affray with his stepbrother in April 1998, pled guilty to assaulting his girlfriend in November 1998, and pled guilty to 
criminal trespassing in November 2002.  Applicant failed to appear for a hearing he demanded on his speeding citation and paid the fine after it had gone to 
collection.  He was terminated from his employment for insubordination, failing to do assigned work, and chronic absenteeism.  He deliberately falsified his 
security clearance application and a statement he gave to a DSS agent.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 12 April 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-20540.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 3 May 2004 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was 
assigned to me on 6 January 2005.  On 8 February 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 22 February 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Without objection from Applicant, I granted Department Counsel's motion to amend the SOR by adding allegations 2.c and 2.d, as follows:</P> 
<P>2.c.  You falsified material facts on a security clearance application, which you caused to be transmitted on about August 8, 2001, when you answered "no" to 
question number 26, your police record, other offenses, in the last seven years have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed 
in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25" (leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related."  You deliberately failed to disclose 
your arrest as set forth in allegation 1.c above.</P> 
<P>2.d.  You intentionally falsified material facts in a statement to a special agent of the Defense Security Service on or about August 8, 2003 when you stated, " I 
have never otherwise been arrested, charged, cited, held, detained, or questioned regarding any alcohol offense." And "I have never otherwise been arrested, 
charged, cited, held, detained, or questioned regarding any offenses regarding violence or domestic violence."  You knew this was false because you were 
arrested for an offense involving alcohol and violence as set forth in allegation 1.c above.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 32-year-old computer operator for a defense contractor.  Ex. 1 at 1, 2.  He had hoped to follow his father, who served more than 30 years in the 
military, but was unable to do so because of his eyesight.  Tr. 9-10.</P> 
<P>On 11 April 1998, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault.  He and his stepbrother had been drinking alcoholic beverages at a bar and became 
embroiled in an affray.  The fight was stopped with Applicant's stepbrother on top of him.  Applicant had minor injuries, but declined medical treatment.  Ex. 5.  
No charges were filed and the case was dismissed.  </P> 
<P>Applicant was arrested on 17 November 1998 and charged with assault, domestic violence, and malicious mischief.  Applicant and his girlfriend were having 
problems.  He arrived home and found his belongings piled up in the yard.  Applicant forced open the door and pushed his girlfriend until she fell over a coffee 
table.  He pushed over bookcases and threw items about the apartment.  When his girlfriend tried to stop him, he threw her on the couch and began to strangle 
her with both hands.  In attempt to prevent Applicant from damaging more property, his girlfriend grabbed him around the waist from behind.  Applicant swung 
his arm back and struck her in the face.  He left the apartment after being confronted by the landlord with a baseball bat.  Ex. 6 at 2.  Applicant pled guilty and 
was sentenced to jail for 30 days and to obtain anger management treatment.  Applicant served 16 or 18 days in jail and received anger management treatment 
for one year.  The charges were eventually dismissed.  Answer; Tr. 19-25.</P> 
<P>In April 1999, Applicant was terminated from his employment for insubordination, failing to do assigned work, and chronic absenteeism.  Ex. 4.  He also 
admits being terminated from four other jobs or leaving under unfavorable conditions.  Tr. 38-40.</P> 
<P>On 7 August 2001, applicant signed and submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in which he certified his answers were "true, complete, and correct" 
to the best of his knowledge and belief and acknowledged that a "knowing and willful false statement" could be punished under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  Question 26 
asked if, in the previous seven years he had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not listed in other modules.  Applicant answered "no," 
and failed to list his April 1998 arrest for assault and domestic violence.<A HREF="03-20540.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Ex. 2 at 12.</P> 
<P>On 29 November 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with criminal trespass.  Applicant had been out drinking alcohol with a friend.  On his way home, 
he cut through private property, "underneath a garage," and was apprehended by police.  A judgment of continuance was entered on condition Applicant pay 
court costs, complete a chemical dependency assessment, and comply with a verbal no contact order, which he did.</P> 
<P>On 18 December 2002, Applicant was cited for speeding.  He contested the citation, but failed to appear at the hearing.  The judge assessed a fine of $162.  The 
fine was turned over for collection.  Applicant did not pay the fine for some time.  Tr. 48; Ex. 8.</P> 
<P>On 8 August 2003, Applicant made a signed, sworn statement to a Defense Security Service agent.  In it, he discussed some of his criminal offenses.  He failed 
to include the 11 April 1998 arrest for assault and domestic violence.  Applicant stated: "I have never otherwise been arrested charged, cited, held, detained, or 
questioned regarding any offenses regarding violence or domestic violence."  Ex. 3 at 3.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J--Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was arrested in November 2002 and charged with criminal trespass/1st degree (&para; 1.a); arrested in November 1998 and 
charged with 3d degree assault/domestic violence (&para; 1.b); and arrested in April 1998 and charged with assault (&para; 1.c).  Applicant admitted each of the 
allegations.  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions establish potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline J</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  Applicant admitted criminal conduct 
(DC E2.A10.1.2.1) consisting of multiple lesser offenses (DC E2.A10.1.2.2).  Applicant appears to have a problem with alcohol, as each of the offenses 
occurred after he had been drinking.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  There is no clear evidence of rehabilitation.  <EM>See</EM> MC E2.A10.1.3.6.  I find 
against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>E--Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was charged with speeding in December 2002 and failed to pay the fine (&para; 2.a); was terminated from employment in 
April 1999 for insubordination, failing to do assigned work, and chronic absenteeism (&para; 2.b); deliberately falsified his SCA by failing to list his arrest for 
assault/domestic violence (&para; 2.c); and intentionally falsified a statement by failing to acknowledge his arrest for assault/domestic violence.  Applicant admitted 
the allegations in &para;&para; 2.a and 2.b, but denied he actually was insubordinate, failed to do assigned work, and was chronically absent.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving 
questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate the 
applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions establish potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E.  His failure to appear for the hearing 
he demanded on the speeding citation </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and the failure to timely pay his fine, as well as the reasons for the termination of his employment is reliable unfavorable 
information (DC E2.A5.1.2.1) and demonstrates a pattern of rule violations (E2.A10.1.2.5).  The deliberate omission of relevant and material facts from his 
SCA is a possibly disqualifying condition.  DC E2.A5.1.2.2.  Deliberately providing false or misleading information to an investigator concerning a security 
clearance is also disqualifying.  DC E2.A5.1.2.3.  An applicant's arrest for criminal conduct is relevant and material to a determination of that applicant's 
security worthiness.  After carefully considering all of the evidence and the adjudication process factors, I find against Applicant.  <EM>See </EM>Directive &para; 6.3.</SPAN></P>
