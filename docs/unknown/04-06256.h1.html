<P>Applicant failed to mitigate the personal and criminal conduct concerns raised by his deliberate falsification of information submitted to the government in a 
recent security clearance application (SF 86), and his false statements to the government through subject interviews during his background investigation. 
Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make 
a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On May 6, 2005, DOHA issued to 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline E (personal conduct) and 
Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant timely submitted a responsive pleading, and requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on October 3, 2005, and I convened a hearing on November 16, 2005. The parties appeared as scheduled and the government 
presented six exhibits (GE 1 - 6), which were admitted without objection. Applicant presented seven exhibits (AE A - G), which were admitted, with AE F 
being admitted over Department Counsel's objection.<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He also testified in his own behalf and presented the testimony of three other witnesses. DOHA received 
the transcript (Tr) on December 1, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 37 years old and has been employed as a heating, air conditioning, and ventilation (HVAC) designer and production manager by defense 
contractors since 1995. His work supports Navy shipyard, surface ship, and aviation configuration, maintenance, and modification programs. Applicant has held 
his current position since October 2001. He is highly regarded by his employer having recently received several awards, such as Employee of the Year and 
Employee of the Quarter. He has been married since 1998, and they have a four-year-old child. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant used marijuana beginning in 1986. Through 1988, he used the drug about three times each month. In 1988 and 1989, he used as often as everyday, 
and sometimes bought small quantities of marijuana for his personal use. From 1989 until 2000, Applicant used marijuana on what is best described as a 
sporadic basis. He used marijuana once in 1999 and once in 2000 with a neighbor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been arrested twice for drug-related offenses. In June 1987, he was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana after a police officer found 
a small quantity of the drug in Applicant's car during a search incident to a traffic stop. The charge was eventually dismissed. He was also arrested in June 1991 
and charged with conspiracy to sell marijuana. Applicant had been riding in a car with a friend who he knew was a small-scale drug dealer. They made a stop so 
the friend could sell some marijuana to a customer who turned out to be an undercover police officer. Applicant was arrested two weeks later and eventually 
sentenced to serve 15 weekends in jail.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on or about October 30, 2002. In response to question 24 (Your Police Record - Alcohol / Drug 
Offenses), he disclosed he had been arrested for three alcohol-related offenses, but did not list his two drug-related arrests. In response to question 27 (Your Use 
of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Illegal Use of Drugs), Applicant did not disclose, as required by the plain language of the question, that he had used 
marijuana in the preceding seven years.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was interviewed on February 19, 2004 by an agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) about adverse information in his background. He gave a 
written, sworn statement to the agent wherein he discussed his alcohol use and alcohol-related arrests. He also stated he had "never been charged with any 
offenses related to drug offenses."<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was re-interviewed in July 2004. He apparently still did not fully disclose his involvement with illegal drugs, because DSS asked, and Applicant 
agreed, to take a polygraph examination to resolve discrepancies in his background.<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Incident to that examination, Applicant gave another written, sworn 
statement to DSS on August 5, 2004, wherein he discussed in detail his involvement with drugs and his drug-related arrests. He claimed in that statement he did 
not disclose his drug arrests because a security official at a company he worked for before hiring on with his current employer in October 2001 advised him he 
did not have to list them. Applicant also stated he did not list the drug arrest information because he was too embarrassed to disclose it.<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> But in his hearing 
testimony, Applicant acknowledged the security official in question had nothing to do with his SF 86, as the form was submitted after he left the company for 
whom the security official worked.<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  He gave a third written, sworn statement to DSS on August 9, 2004. In that statement, Applicant explained his SF 86 
omissions occurred "because [he] either did not recall [the drug-related arrests] or did not realize that some of them may have been Felonies that were 
reduced."<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In response to the SOR allegation that he deliberately falsified his SF 86 by answering "no" to question 27 regarding use of illegal drugs during the prior seven 
years (SOR 1.a), Applicant asserted "[t]he environment (company computer workstation in open workplace) did not provide proper conditions that promoted 
focused recollection of information due to the creation of nervousness, emotion and lack of privacy."<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> In response to the SOR allegation that he deliberately 
falsified his statement to a DSS investigator in February 2004, by stating he had never been charged with a drug-related offense (SOR 1.b), Applicant averred 
that the interview was emotionally taxing for him and that he "was unable to comprehensively focus [his] attention on reviewing the contents of the statement 
prior to signing it but could only offer the best of my ability available under this circumstance."<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife and neighbors testified he is a great father and member of the community. They trust Applicant implicitly. None of the witnesses, including his 
wife, knows Applicant has used marijuana in the past seven years or that he may have lied to DSS about his past.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> for consideration in evaluating an applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Further, security 
clearance decisions must reflect consideration of disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances 
of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive.<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The presence 
or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines 
should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified 
information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are Guideline E (personal 
conduct) and Guideline J (criminal conduct).<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> for an applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for the Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the 
government meets its burden, it establishes that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. 
The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the 
Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government 
based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability 
and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels 
resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a security concern may arise if it is shown an applicant has exhibited  questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such conduct may indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified 
information.<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Here, the government questioned Applicant's trustworthiness by alleging he deliberately omitted from his SF 86 the fact he had used marijuana 
within seven years before he submitted his SF 86 (SOR &para; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a), and that he lied to a DSS agent who interviewed him in February 2004 when he denied having 
ever been charged with any drug-related offense (SOR &para; 1.b). The government has presented sufficient evidence, and the record as a whole as it bears on this 
issue supports the government's decision, to deny Applicant's request for clearance. Specifically, the facts established herein support application of Guideline E 
disqualifying condition (DC) 2<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> DC 3.<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant deliberately omitted the fact of his drug use in 1999 and 2000 from his SF 86 by answering "no" to 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">question 27. He also deliberately lied when he submitted a statement to DSS in February 2004 by denying in that statement he had ever been arrested for a drug-related offense.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, Applicant offered various, sometimes conflicting reasons why he omitted his drug use from his SF 86 and why he falsified his statement to DSS in 
February 2004. Applicant claimed in his response to the SOR that he made a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the error in his SF 86. However, his interview 
with DSS occurred nearly 16 months after he submitted his SF 86, and he failed to disclose his drug-related arrests even then. It was not until Applicant was 
faced with a polygraph examination that he elected to be forthcoming about his arrests and his drug use. Applicant's </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">completion of his security clearance 
application was the initial step in requesting a security clearance. Because false or incomplete information given in the SF 86 is capable of affecting the way in 
which government investigators obtain complete and accurate information about an applicant, it is material. Applicant's omissions from his SF 86 and his first 
subject interview extended his background investigation and required application of additional resources that would not have been needed had he been honest in 
the first place.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has also averred he was concerned about his privacy and embarrassed about disclosing his drug use and drug-related arrests. This is not an acceptable 
reason for withholding relevant information from the government in these circumstances. By doing so, Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">clearly demonstrated he was willing to place 
his own interests and concerns ahead of the government's interest in ensuring he is an acceptable risk for access to classified information. Such conduct is  
directly at odds with the fiduciary nature of one's responsibilities when holding a clearance. The totality of the available information about Applicant's candor 
also shows he has not yet accepted responsibility for his misleading statements. Accordingly, none of the Guideline E mitigating conditions (MC) apply, and I 
conclude Guideline E against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government also alleged Applicant's deliberate falsifications constituted criminal conduct insofar as they violated federal law under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 
(SOR &para; 2.a). Criminal conduct is a security concern because a person who is willing to disregard the law </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and risk fines or incarceration may also be willing to 
disregard rules and regulations governing the protection of classified information.<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Available information is sufficient to support this allegation as it relates 
back to SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.b. Based on these allegations, Guideline J DC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 2<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As discussed under Guideline E, above, this conduct was recent, done knowingly and deliberately, and there are multiple instances of falsification at issue here. 
Further, Applicant has not accepted responsibility for his conduct, choosing instead to offer multiple, contradictory explanations for why his conduct was not 
intentional. The record does not support application of any of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct, and I conclude Guideline J against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guideline. 
A fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="04-06256.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> of information about Applicant's personal conduct and the criminal aspects of that conduct, taken in the context of all of 
the information before me shows that he has failed to overcome the government's reasonable doubts about his judgment and reliability. I am particularly 
mindful of the outstanding record Applicant has established at work, and of the numerous positive recommendations from friends, relatives, and co-workers. 
However, his falsifications of his SF 86 and his statements to investigators raise legitimate questions about his judgment and trustworthiness. These issues bear 
directly on an applicant's ability to protect classified information, and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the 
government entrusts its interests. Absent substantial information to mitigate these doubts, which Applicant has failed to provide, I conclude he has failed to 
overcome the government's case. </SPAN></P>
