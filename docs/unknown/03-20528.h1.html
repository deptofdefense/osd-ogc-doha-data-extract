</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 33-year-old network engineer employed by a defense contractor.  He was arrested for DUI  three times, and for assault once before he quit using 
alcohol in 2004.  He successfully mitigated security concerns about alcohol consumption and criminal conduct.  He has allowed delinquent debts to remain 
unpaid for over four years.  He gave false answers on a security clearance application and lied to a federal investigator about his police records and financial 
delinquencies.  He failed to mitigate security concerns about financial considerations and personal conduct.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  As required by Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 &para;&nbsp;E3.1.2 (Jan. 2, 1960), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on July 22, 2004, detailing the basis for its decision - 
security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in an undated writing and requested a decision without a hearing.  Department Counsel 
submitted a file of relevant material (FORM) in support of the government's case, a copy of which was received by Applicant on June 16, 2006.  Applicant was 
afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation by July 16, 2006.  He filed no response.  The case was 
assigned to me on August 15, 2006.  </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted 18 allegations contained in the SOR, but denied those in subparagraphs 2.a., 2.c., 2.e., and 4.f.  The admissions are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional 
findings of fact: </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 33-year-old network engineer employed by a defense contractor.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  He has never been married.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He served nearly three years as an enlisted 
airman in the U.S. Air Force (USAF).<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  He held a SECRET security clearance in the USAF, and was granted the same clearance a year after he left the 
USAF.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant owes state income tax in the amount of $3,118, for which a state tax lien was filed for that amount in March 2004.  He has delinquent accounts in the 
amounts of $234, $300, and $35,254.  He had a department store account charged off in June 2000, in the amount of $1,287, a credit union account charged off 
in October 2000, in the amount of $1,998, and a mortgage in the amount of $39,919, charged off in March 2001.  He filed a voluntary Chapter 13 bankruptcy 
petition on March 19, 2001, and it was dismissed on July 31, 2001, at the request of Applicant.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  He re-filed the Chapter 13 petition on October 25, 2001, and 
it was dismissed on January 25, 2002, for failure to attend the first meeting of creditors.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  He claimed that all debts were paid except the debts for $35,254 and 
$39,919.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  He is attempting to locate the debtor to whom he owes $35,254 in an effort to set up a payment plan.  The debt for $39,919 was for a second 
mortgage on rental property.  The renters stopped paying rent, he was unable to make his monthly mortgage payment, the lender commenced foreclosure 
proceedings, and he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy petitions twice, to stop the foreclosure sales until he could obtain a new tenant.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  An August 2005 credit 
report shows all debts still unpaid except the one for $1,998.  New delinquent debts indicated are child support ($3,726), a credit instrument ($8,242), and cell 
phone ($805).<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant was arrested on January 14, 1998, and charged with driving while intoxicated (liquor/drugs).  He was granted probation before judgment.  He was 
again arrested on May 27, 1999, and charged with driving under the influence (DUI).  On November 30, 1999, Applicant was successfully discharged from a 6-week "Alcohol/DWI Education Treatment Program."<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  He was arrested a third time on February 25, 2000, for DUI, but no charges were subsequently filed.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant consumed alcohol at times to excess and to the point of intoxication from about 1994 until at least April 2002.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  He continued to consume one glass 
of wine per month, and an occasional drink on holidays and special occasions.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  In his answer to the SOR in 2004, Applicant stated he no longer drinks 
alcohol.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In addition to the arrests for DUI in 1998, 1999, and 2000, he was arrested on September 28, 1997, for assault after he jumped on the bumper of a lady's car to 
avoid being hit by a friend parking his car.  The lady came running and screaming across the street so Applicant threw a cup of soda in her face.  In court, he 
apologized and the case was dismissed.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant falsified material facts on a security clearance application, dated January 23, 2001, on which he was required to respond to the following: </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>24. Your Police Record - Alcohol/Drug Offenses  </STRONG>Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs?  For this item, 
report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been sealed or otherwise stricken from the record.  The single exception to this requirement 
is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21U.S.C. 844 or 
18 U.S.C. 3607.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant answered "No," failing to list the DUI arrests in 1998, 1999, and 2000.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  Since he was given probation, his attorney advised him there would be no 
convictions on his record.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  He also falsely answered the following question:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Question 26.  Your Police Record - Other Offenses  </STRONG>In the last 7 years, have you been arrested or charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in 
modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25?  (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.)  For this item, report information 
regardless of whether the record in your case has been sealed or otherwise stricken from the record.  The single exception to this requirement is for certain 
convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 
3607.</P> 
 
<P>He failed to list his arrest on September 28, 1997, for simple assault.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  Because the charges were dropped, he believed he did not have to answer the 
question.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  In response to the following, <STRONG>"Question 38.  Your financial delinquencies - 180 days </STRONG> In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent 
on any debt(s)?", he answered "No" knowing that he had seven delinquent accounts: the  state income tax lien of $3,118; collection accounts of $234, $300, 
and $35,254; and charged off accounts of $1,287, $1,998, and $39,919.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  Applicant claimed unawareness of these debts because his wife's credit report had 
merged with his own credit report.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>During a subject interview by a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) on January 30, 2002, more than once Applicant denied ever having been 
arrested or detained by police, concealing the arrests in 1998, 1999, and 2000.  During the same interview, he denied his 1997 arrest for simple assault, 
claiming he had never been arrested in the city where he was charged.  When asked if he had been arrested for DUI in May 1999, Applicant denied the incident, 
concealing the truth.  He denied knowledge, because he received probation on the one DUI case, and the assault case was dismissed.  His attorney told him 
there would be nothing on his record and he believed that applied across the board.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  He also denied the 1999 arrest because he "was scared that if I disclosed 
this arrest I would not get my security clearance."<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant worked in Iraq in 2004, and received commendation letters for helping rebuild that country.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></P>

Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the 
applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or 
presence of rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  The decision to deny an individual a security

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €€€€€€œ"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: "></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €"><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €€€€€ˆ€*">The available information demonstrates Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations.  He has been delinquent in payments on numerous 
accounts.  Consequently, the government established its case under Guideline F.  Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. <EM>(A 
history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. <EM>(Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>) are both applicable. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €€€€€ˆ€*">Various conditions can mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.  The Directive sets out Financial Considerations Mitigating 
Conditions (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.1. (<EM>The behavior was not recent</EM>), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2. (<EM>It was an isolated incident</EM>), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. (<EM>The conditions 
that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a 
death, divorce, or separation</EM>), which do not apply.  Applicant's most recent credit report (2005) shows all but one debt as unpaid, and notes three new 
delinquencies.  So the conduct is recent and is not an isolated incident.  There is no evidence of unexpected events that could mitigate failure to satisfy 
obligations.  Likewise, FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. <EM>(The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve bad debts) </EM>is not 
applicable because Applicant has made little effort over the past four years to resolve his debts.  I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €"><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €€€€€ˆ€*">The government established its case under Guideline G.  The following Guideline G Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) applies: AC DC 
E2.A7.1.2.1. (<EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or their criminal incidents 
related to alcohol use</EM>), because Applicant admitted his DUI arrests in 1998, 1999, and 2000.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €€€€€ˆ€*">Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) E2.A7.1.3.2. <EM>(The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent 
problem), </EM>and AC MC E2.A7.1.3.3. <EM>(Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety) </EM>are applicable.  The three are related incidents occurring more than 
six years ago, and only one case was charged.  In his answer to the SOR in 2004, Applicant stated he no longer drinks alcohol.  I conclude Guideline G for 
Applicant. <STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €€€€€ˆ€*"><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €€€€€ˆ€*">The government established its case under Guideline J.  Applicant admitted his DUI arrests in 1998, 1999, and 2000, although there are no convictions on his 
record.  The 1997 assault case was a misunderstanding, and after an apology to the victim, the case was dismissed.  Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 
(CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. <EM>(Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged) </EM>applies. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €€">Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) E2.A6.1.3.1. <EM>(The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>) applies.  Further, CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2. (<EM>The crime 
was an isolated incident</EM>) applies.  Applicant's one DUI probation does not disqualify him from holding a security clearance.  Applicant  stopped consuming 
alcohol in 2004.  The other cases were dismissed.  I find the concern is mitigated.  I conclude Guideline J for Applicant.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €€"><STRONG>Personal Conduct </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €€">The government established its case under Guideline E.  Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (<EM>The deliberate omission, 
concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to 
conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award 
fiduciary responsibilities</EM>) and PC DC E2.A5.1.2.3. (<EM>Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an 
investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness 
determination</EM>) apply, because Applicant's answers were not truthful.  He said he did not disclose the information because he received probation, or the charges 
were dismissed, or his wife's credit report merged with his, or he was unaware, or he wanted to get a clearance.  None of these reasons justify lying on his SF 
86 or to a DSS investigator.  I believe he knew what the phrase "have you ever been charged with" meant.  I do not find his explanations to be credible.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €">No mitigating conditions provided under the Directive are applicable.  I conclude Guideline E against Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €"><STRONG>Whole Person Analysis</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €€€">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €€€€€€€€€">  "Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a 
determination."<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: €"><EM>  </EM>In evaluating Applicant's case, in addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I also considered the "whole person" concept in 
evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.<A HREF="03-20528.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  I considered his age (33), his employment, his prior military service, his 
service in Iraq, and what might motivate him to be less than truthful.  Applicant supplied false answers on a security clearance application.  This is problematic 
because candor with the government about a person's negatives is the crux of a trustworthiness determination.  If a person discloses the adverse information 
about himself, then he may be trusted with confidential or classified information.  After sifting through all of the excuses, the real reason he lied is he "was 
scared that if I disclosed this arrest I would not get my security clearance."  Although not alleged in the SOR, these false statements are separate violations of 18 
U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  He has not paid his creditors, even though he claimed to have paid them.  There were three new delinquencies that showed up on the latest 
credit report.  This does not demonstrate a good-faith effort to pay creditors.  This raises questions about his reliability and judgment.  The totality of the record  
raises reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion 
expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests.  I conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's 
security clearance.</SPAN></P>
