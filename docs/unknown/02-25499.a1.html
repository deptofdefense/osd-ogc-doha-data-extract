<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On May 24, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons 
advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)(Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided on the written record.  On November 29, 2005, after considering the 
record,  Chief Administrative Judge Robert Robinson Gales granted Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant 
to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Chief Administrative Judge's favorable clearance decision under Guidelines F is 
arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  </P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel argues that the Chief Administrative Judge erred in his application of Mitigating Conditions 3<A HREF="02-25499.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and 6.<A HREF="02-25499.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  In support of his argument, 
Department Counsel contends the Judge relied too heavily on Applicant's own statements in making his findings.  The Board does not find Department 
Counsel's argument persuasive. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The statements of the Applicant upon which the Chief Administrative Judge relied were offered into evidence by Department Counsel as part of the 
government's file of relevant material.  The Board has previously noted that, given the realities of the evidentiary record available to the Judge in most DOHA 
cases and the substantial evidence rule, it is untenable to require, as a matter of law, that Judge's have more than Applicant's testimony for each finding of fact.  
This approach recognizes that there may be circumstances where a Judge has sound reasons not to rely on an applicant's uncorroborated testimony for findings 
of fact, and that the fact that a judge has enough evidence to make a finding of fact does not necessarily mean that the finding is entitled to much weight.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, 
e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel's argument concerning Guideline F Mitigating Condition 3 is premised on the notion that an Administrative Judge cannot apply that 
mitigating condition unless the applicant demonstrates that the debts at issue became delinquent as a direct result of the circumstances beyond applicant's 
control.  The Board has previously noted that a Judge is not required to interpret Mitigating Condition 3 so narrowly.  Given the wording of that mitigating 
condition, it is not unreasonable for a Judge to construe it as covering a situation where the record evidence shows that events beyond an applicant's control 
resulted in, or significantly contributed to the applicant's debts becoming delinquent, the applicant becoming unable to deal with or otherwise address debts that 
had become delinquent previously, and the applicant incurring new, unforeseen debts that aggravate or exacerbate the applicant's financial situation.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Given the 
record in this case, Department Counsel has not demonstrated it was arbitrary capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to give Applicant some credit for the 
mitigating evidence he produced under Mitigating Condition 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Chief Administrative Judge made sustainable findings that Applicant had established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions 
to implement that plan.   Applicant was not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he had completely paid off his indebtedness.  Given the record in this 
case, Department Counsel has not demonstrated it was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to give Applicant some credit for the mitigating 
evidence he produced under Mitigating Condition 6.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel is essentially arguing that the record evidence shows that Applicant was not as diligent about dealing with his financial problems as he 
could have been.  However, the unfavorable record evidence cited by Department Counsel is not sufficient to demonstrate the Administrative Judge's decision 
is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As the trier of fact, the Judge had to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence 
outweighed the unfavorable evidence or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice versa</EM>.  Department Counsel's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the record evidence is not sufficient to 
demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  In this case, Applicant had made arrangements for 
paying-off his indebtedness, reasonably documented actions he had taken in furtherance of those arrangements, and demonstrated a not insubstantial reduction 
in his indebtedness.  The Board need not agree with the Judge's decision under Guideline F to conclude that it is sustainable.    </SPAN></P>
