<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 1, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
under  Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct), why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted or denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated June 6, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He requested that his case be decided on the written record in 
lieu of a hearing. On September 4, 2003, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM)  <A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided to Applicant, and he was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant 
did not submit a response to the FORM. The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on October 27, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the FORM, Department Counsel offered thirteen documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 -13),  which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered no 
documentary evidence into the record. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and upon due consideration 
of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is a 46 year old employee of a defense contractor</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> who seeks a security clearance on behalf of Applicant. He is married and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">is a high school graduate.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">abuses illegal substances. Applicant first used marijuana in 1976 
when he was 19 years old. In a signed, sworn statement he made to a DSS agent in October 2001, Applicant stated that he stopped using marijuana after his 
arrest in 1994 for possession of a controlled substance.   However, Applicant stated in another signed, sworn statement he made to a DSS agent in September 
2002, "I have continued to use marijuana mostly on weekends, even after my discharge for drug usage, and I still do to this date."  He also</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> stated, "I believe I 
am psychologically addicted to the use of marijuana ..." (Exhibit 8).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant has purchased much of the marijuana that he has used over the years. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In 1977 he was arrested for use and possession of dangerous drugs. In 1994 he 
was arrested for being in possession of a controlled substance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">He failed a drug test at his place of employment in 1993, and he was ordered to attend a drug 
abuse program, which he completed. In 1994, after failing a second company drug test he was terminated from his employment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> has continued to use marijuana after he received a security clearance in 1990, and after he completed his most current SCA in 2000 (Exhibits 4 and 
8). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>(Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">was engaged in criminal activity.  In 1994, he was arrested for 
possession of a controlled substance and being under the influence of a controlled substance. In 1977, he was arrested for use and possession of dangerous 
drugs. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">On August 14, 1996, Applicant was cited for a vehicle code violation for failing to wear his seat belt.  He was required to appear in court for this offense. He 
did not appear, and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest. The warrant is still outstanding. <STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal conduct) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he furnished untruthful information to the Government in four 
separate questions and responses when  Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> completed a signed, sworn Security Clearance Application (SCA) on April 3, 2000 (Exhibit 4). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Question #24 asks, "Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?" Applicant answered  "No" to question #24.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">  
He did not provide any information regarding his arrest in 1994 for being in possession of a controlled substance and his arrest in 1977 for use and possession 
of dangerous drugs.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Question #27 asks, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">"Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance . . . ?"<STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant answered  
"No" to question #27. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">He did not provide any information regarding </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">his marijuana usage which extended from 1976 to at least 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Question #28 asks, "Have you ever illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while 
possessing a security clearance . . .?" Applicant answered  "No" to question #27. He failed to provide the information that he used marijuana during the period 
in which he possessed a security clearance, which was granted to him in 1990.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Question #20 asks, "Has any of the following happened to you in the last ten years?-Fired from a job . . . Left a job for other reason under unfavorable 
circumstances." Applicant answered  "No" to question #20.  He failed to provide information regarding his termination from employment in 1994 for failure to 
comply with the company substance abuse policy. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully 
considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative 
guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or 
mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or 
against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>(Guideline H - Drug Involvement) </STRONG> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Concern: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. 
Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(E2.A8.1.1.2.1.) drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or 
cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens); and(E2.A8.1.1.2.2.) inhalants and other similar substances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A8.1.2.1. Any drug abuse (see above definition);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A8.1.2.2. Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A8.1.2.5. Failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by a credentialed medical professional. Recent drug involvement, especially 
following the granting of a security clearance, or an expressed intent not to discontinue use, will almost invariably result in an unfavorable determination.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">On June 7, 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a Memorandum, <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM>Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances 
as Mandated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. The memorandum provides policy guidance for the 
implementation of Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United States 
Code, to add a new section (10 U.S.C. &sect; 986) that precludes the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense under specific 
circumstances. The situation described above involves one of those specific circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A10.1.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Concern: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A10.1.2.1. Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between Applicant's conduct and 
the continued holding of a security clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM></EM> case. Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">With respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case. Applicant's improper and illegal drug 
abuse, including the purchase, possession, and use of marijuana during the period from 1976 to at least 2002, is of concern, especially in light of his desire to 
have access to the nation's secrets. Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his illegal substance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement Disqualifying 
Condition (DC) E2.A8.1.2.1. (<EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">any drug abuse</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">), and DC E2.A8.1.2.2.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's stated continued marijuana usage falls within DC E2.A8.1.2.5. (<EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by a 
credentialed medical professional. Recent drug involvement, especially following the granting of a security clearance, or an expressed intent not to discontinue

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Finally, under the circumstances herein, Applicant's lengthy period of illegal substance abuse plus his indication as recently as September 2002 that he

regarding usage of drugs, including his arrests in 1994 and 1977 for drug related criminal activity, and his failure to appear in court in 1996.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Additionally, while it was not alleged in the SOR, Applicant engaged in criminal activity by intentionally giving false or misleading information on the SCA 
that he completed </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">on August 2000, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> which violated Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, which is a felony.<STRONG> </STRONG>He also used illegal substances for many 
years, which is clearly criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">DC E2.A10.1.2. and DC E2.A10.1.2.1. apply in this case.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant has not mitigated this allegation. Paragraph 2 is found against Applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 3 </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>(Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided false and incomplete material 
information to the Government in response to four questions on the SCA that he executed in August 3, 2000. Applicant knew, or should have known, that the 
four questions required affirmative responses and information regarding his history of drug usage and his termination from employment because of his failure to 
comply with company substance abuse policy.  There is no reasonable explanation for his failure to provide this information.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to our nation's secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies 
material facts on a security clearance application, it is extremely difficult to conclude that he nevertheless possesses the judgment, reliability and trustworthiness 
required of clearance holders. In this case, Applicant's failure to offer any independent evidence indicating that he has reformed and is now reliable and 
trustworthy, precludes a finding that it is now clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified information. I resolve Guideline E 
against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A5.1.2.2. applies because the information that Applicant provided in his 
SCA was known or should have been known by him to be an omission and concealment of relevant and material facts.  No Mitigating Conditions apply.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">   </SPAN></P>
