<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant.  On 7 November 2003, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons<A HREF="02-27840.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>
(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign
Influence) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 15 November 2003 and
elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel
submitted the Government's written case on 22 March 2004.  A complete copy of the file of relevant
material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections
and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  Applicant received
the FORM on 5 April 2004 and responded on 12 April 2004.  The case was assigned to me on 28
April 2004.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently
trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at
527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States,
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well
as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to
abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security
clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive. 
</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the
disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating
the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative
process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security
clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865
&sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and
the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">	Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the
personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant
from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive

2 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P>

risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other person to whom he  may be bound

foreign family members are not agents of a foreign power.  But the inquiry in a foreign influence
case is not limited to consideration of whether the foreign contacts are agents of a foreign power. 
Applicant still must demonstrate that his family members are not in a position to be exploited by a
foreign power. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> "Although there has been increased cooperation between the U.S. and the PRC since
