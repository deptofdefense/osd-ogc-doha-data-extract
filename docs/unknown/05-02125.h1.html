<P>Applicant failed to file federal and state income tax returns for eight consecutive tax years.  He offered no justification for his conduct.  Security concerns based 
on personal conduct and criminal conduct are not mitigated.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 9, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to not 
grant a security clearance to Applicant.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 
1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 
1992), as amended and modified (Directive). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and J (Criminal Conduct).  Under 
Guideline E, it alleges Applicant failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for eight consecutive tax years from 1997 through 2004.  SOR &para; 1.a. 
alleges his failure to file federal returns, and &para; 1.b. alleges failure to file state returns.  Under Guideline J, it alleges each failure to file tax returns violated 
federal and state law.  SOR &para;&para; 2.a. through 2.h. allege violations of 26 U.S.C. &sect; 7203, and &para;&para; 2.i. through 2.p. allege violations of state law.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on October 25, 2005, admitted all the allegations,  and elected to have the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">case decided on the written record in lieu of a 
hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on November 4, 2005.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was 
provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  
Applicant received the FORM on November 18, 2005.  He did not submit any additional information.  The case was assigned to me on January 6, 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL RULING</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As part of the Government's submission, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR &para;&para; 2.i. through 2.p., by correcting the citation of the state law allegedly 
violated by Applicant.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant received the motion to amend as part of the FORM and did not object.  As part of this decision, I have granted the motion to 
amend the SOR as requested by Department Counsel.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the entire record, including Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 43-year-old engineer for a defense contractor.  He is married and has three children.  He has worked for his current employer since August 2002.  
He received a security clearance in March 1990.<A HREF="05-02125.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted he did not file federal and state income tax returns for eight consecutive tax years from 1997 through 2004.<A HREF="05-02125.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  On February 8, 2005, after 
being telephonically contacted by a security investigator, he hired a licensed financial planner to gather the necessary documentation and file his tax returns.  In 
an interview on February 10, 2005, he told the security investigator he had not filed his returns because of a combination of lost or misplaced records and 
problems he and his wife were having in managing their finances.  He told the investigator he did not believe he owed any taxes and his only excuse for not 
filing was "it became easier to do nothing and to try and ignore the problem" as he fell further behind.  He also told the investigator he has a good income and 
there were no "overriding financial reasons" for not filing his tax returns.<A HREF="05-02125.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  As of June 23, 2005, the financial planner had requested copies of documents from 
the Internal Revenue Service in order to prepare and file Applicant's tax returns.<A HREF="05-02125.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  There is no evidence in the record showing any of the returns have yet been 
filed.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the 
applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and 
mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material 
facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para;&para; 6.3.1 through 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. 
Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations 
could indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  "A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations" is a 
disqualifying condition (DC 5) under this guideline.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.5.  Applicant's repeated failures to file income tax returns violated 26 U.S.C. &sect; 
7203, as well as the comparable provisions of his state's tax laws.  I conclude DC 5 is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has offered no mitigating circumstances to justify his conduct.  After evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has 
not mitigated the security concern based on personal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  A disqualifying 
condition under this guideline may be based on allegations or an applicant's admission of criminal conduct, whether or not charged (DC 1).  Directive &para; 
E2.A10.1.2.1.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses may also be disqualifying (DC 2).  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.2.2.  Applicant's admitted failure to 
file his federal and state tax returns establishes DC 1 and DC 2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal conduct can be mitigated by showing it was not recent (MC 1), an isolated incident (MC 2), or there is "clear evidence of successful rehabilitation" 
(MC 6).  Directive &para;&para; E2.A10.1.3.1., E2.A10.1.3.2., E2.A10.1.3.6.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>See also </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.1.3. (frequency and recency of conduct). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The issues under both 
C 1 and MC 6 are whether there has been a significant period of time without any evidence of misconduct, and whether the evidence shows changed 
circumstances or conduct.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's tax delinquencies have continued until the present and involved an eight-year course of conduct.  Thus, I conclude MC 1 and MC 2 are not 
established.  MC 6 also is not established because he has no "track record" of tax compliance.  "Only with the passage of time will there be a track record that 
shows whether a person, through actions and conduct, is willing and able to adhere to a stated intention to refrain from acting in a way that the person has acted 
in the past."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 97-0727, 1998 DOHA LEXIS 302 at *7 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 1998).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering the disqualifying conditions and the lack of mitigating conditions, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I 
conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concern based on criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>
