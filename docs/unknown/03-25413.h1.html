<P>Applicant is a U.S. Department of State contractor employee.  He served more than two years in prison 26 years ago.  He listed an erroneous date of birth when 
he enlisted in the Army, and applied for two consecutive driver's licenses, a Social Security card, a State Department building pass, and a security clearance.  
He erroneously described his discharge from the Army on his security clearance application (SF 86).  He incurred several delinquent medical bills, but has 
resolved all but one that could not be verified.  He refuted the allegations of falsifying his birth date, and mitigated the security concerns based on criminal 
conduct and financial considerations.  10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 is not applicable.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 22, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny 
Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and F (Financial Considerations).  Under 
Guideline E, it alleges Applicant supplied a fictitious date of birth to various federal and state agencies on six occasions.  Under Guideline F, it alleges eight 
delinquent debts totaling $13, 750.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on August 11, 2005.  He denied falsifying his birth date, denied seven of the eight alleged delinquent debts, and 
requested a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on November 28, 2005, and heard as scheduled on January 10, 2006.  I kept the record open until January 25, 
2006, to enable both sides to submit additional evidence and argument on the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 to this case.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 
on January 18, 2006.  I received timely submissions from both parties.  Department Counsel's submission is incorporated in the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) 
II, with one attachment marked "Attachment A."  Applicant's post-hearing submissions are incorporated as Applicant's Exhibits (AX) H, I, J, and K.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL RULING</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, I granted Department Counsel's motion to amend the SOR.  The amendment adds &para; 3 and subparagraphs 3.a. and 3.b., alleging Applicant was 
charged and convicted of felonious use of a firearm and robbery in 1979 and served at least two and a half years in prison, and further alleging he is disqualified 
from holding a security clearance under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  The amendment also adds an additional allegation that Applicant falsified his SF 86 by deliberately 
failing to disclose he received a less than honorable discharge from the Army.  Although the motion to amend designated the additional allegation of 
falsification as &para; 2.a., it was redesignated at the hearing as &para; 1.g.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Department Counsel submitted a copy of the contract with the U.S. State Department on 
which Applicant works, incorporated in the record as HX I.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the conviction alleged in &para; 3.a., did not concede the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 alleged in &para; 3.b., and denied the falsification alleged in 
the redesignated &para; 1.g.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR &para; 1.b. incorrectly identified the jurisdiction in which Applicant obtained his first driver's license.  On my own motion, I amended to SOR to conform 
to the evidence.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 45-year-old system administrator for a U.S. State Department contractor.  He has worked for his current employer since September 2000.  He has 
never held a security clearance.  He does not work on any Department of Defense (DOD) contracts, and his employer does not anticipate assigning him to any 
DOD contracts.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  A company employee testified all his company's current federal government contracts were with the Department of State, except for a few 
small contracts with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant grew up in a troubled family.  He ran away from home in 1973, when he was about 13 years old.  His stepmother committed suicide two years after 
he ran away.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant applied for a Social Security card in 1973.  He testified he was unsure of his year of birth and guessed it to be 1958.  His Social Security employment 
records listed his year of birth as 1958 for many years.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  The record does not reflect how, if at all, his birth date was verified. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army on March 26, 1975.  According to Applicant, he could not provide a birth certificate when he enlisted.  When his recruiter 
told him a baptismal certificate would suffice, he directed the recruiter to the Catholic church where he was baptized.  His recruiter later told him he had 
obtained a baptismal certificate reflecting his birth date.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Applicant never saw the baptismal certificate.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  His military records reflected his date of birth as 
October 28, 1957.  He subsequently obtained a driver's license, using his military identification as proof of his date of birth.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  He performed poorly in the 
Army, and he was discharged as unsuitable for military service on March 9, 1977, receiving a general discharge under honorable conditions.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After his discharge from the Army, Applicant obtained a driver's license in another jurisdiction, using his previous driver's license as proof of identity and age.  
This license also reflects his year of birth as 1957.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In June 1979, Applicant was convicted of robbery and felonious use of a firearm, and sentenced to 15 years in the penitentiary, with the last six years suspended 
for a period of ten years.  He was released on parole on May 15, 1981, and released from probation on September 19, 1985.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  While incarcerated, he received 
outstanding evaluations and furthered his education.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Shortly after being released on parole, Applicant began investigating his birth date, because his prison records reflected it as 1957 and there had been some 
discussion during his sentencing hearing about his actual age.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  He obtained a copy of his birth certificate in late May 1981, and learned he was born in 1960.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  
He took no action at that time to correct the records.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was married in June 1983, but has been separated from his spouse for more than seven years.  They had one child, born on June 23, 1986.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While he was on parole, Applicant was arrested for visual trespassing, a "peeping tom" offense, in August 1984.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  According to Applicant, the incident 
occurred when he walked past a window in his apartment complex and noticed the blinds were open and a partially clothed woman was visible.  He stopped and 
looked, standing about six feet from the window.  As he started to walk away, he was stopped by "detectives" and asked what he was doing.  He admitted in 
court that he stopped and looked into the window.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  He received a suspended 30-day jail sentence, paid a $50 fine, and was placed on probation for 12 months.  
His parole was not revoked.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant suffered a grand mal seizure in December 1990 and was diagnosed as suffering from a frontal glioma, a form of brain cancer.  He experienced 
astigmatism, a speech impediment, dizziness, and memory loss.  He was treated with radiation therapy and medication.  He was unable to work full-time until 
1995.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant and his spouse separated, he was required to pay child support.  He does not know the current address of his spouse or child.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  His spouse 
moved to another state, and she obtained a child support order in her new home state; but her previous home state, where Applicant continued to live, continued 
to pursue him for child support payments.  On August 28, 1991, his spouse's new home state ordered him to pay child support of $274 per month,<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> and his pay 
was garnished for the amount of $105.63 for each two-week pay period.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> This garnishment was terminated in July 2004.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  However, his home state continues 
to garnish his pay in the amount of $59.99 per two-week pay period.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  As of May 6, 2003, his child support arrearage was determined by his home state to be 
$15,332.78.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  Because the child is now 19 years old, any payments are applied entirely to the arrearage.  Applicant admits he owes an arrearage, but he disputes 
the amount, because he believes he has been charged twice by two jurisdictions for one obligation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In about 1995 or 1996, Applicant applied for a Social Security card, using his driver's license as identification.  The Social Security Administration continued 
to list his year of birth as 1958 instead of 1957.  He has now corrected his Social Security records to reflect his correct birth date.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1996, Applicant became acquainted with a woman in his car pool.  They became friends, began dating, and eventually decided to live together in a 
committed relationship.  His "significant other" testified on his behalf at the hearing.  She has a bachelor's degree in rehabilitation education and has about five 
years working in that field.  She currently works for a major law firm.  She is familiar with Applicant's criminal record, medical condition, and financial 
history.  She has assisted him "in setting goals such as educational direction, retirement investment options, and spiritual development."  She believes he has 
"taken some serious measures in reconstructing his life."  She considers him a reliable, trustworthy individual, and a financially responsible person.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At some time in 1998, Applicant's automobile, worth only about $500, was towed without his knowledge, even though it was lawfully parked and properly 
registered.  He reported it stolen.  When he learned many months later it had been towed and he was being billed $200 per day in storage fees, he refused to pay 
and told the towing company to keep the car in satisfaction of the debt.  He disputes this debt (SOR &para; 2.f.), has consulted with a lawyer about it, and has not 
paid it.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While recovering from the effects of brain cancer and its treatments, Applicant lived with his father, who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease as well as 
diabetes.  He assisted his father financially while they lived together and tried to save his father's failing limousine business.  His father spent his final days in 
hospice care and died of cardiac arrest in December 1999.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Around 2000, Applicant was diagnosed with hepatitis C and diabetes, which he treats with medication.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>  He continues to work full time.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant incurred several medical bills not covered by his insurance.  Two judgments were entered against him in April 1995 (SOR &para;&para; 2.a. and 2.b.), and three 
delinquent accounts were placed for collection in 1999 (SOR &para;&para; 2.c., 2.d., and 2.e.).  Four of the five debts have been paid in full.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A>  Applicant testified he has 
been willing but unable to pay the fifth debt of $123, alleged in SOR &para; 2.d., because the creditor has been unable to retrieve the records, which were retired and 
sent to a storage facility in 2001.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> When Applicant applied for a State Department building pass in 2000, he listed his birth date as October 28, 1958.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A>  He listed the same birth date on his SF 86 
in December 2001.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A>  His security officer believes he did not notice the incorrect date on his SF 86 until it was called to his attention, at which time he 
immediately corrected it.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A>  In August 2003, Applicant told a security investigator he learned of his actual age in May 1981, but he continued to list 1958 as his 
birth year to make his security application forms consistent with the date reflected in other government records.  He denied any intent to defraud or deceive.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> 
He corrected the birth date on his building pass in December 2003.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A> He has corrected his birth date on his Social Security records, and his SF 86 dated 
February 24, 2004 reflects his correct birth date.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant executed his SF 86 in December 2001 and again in February 2004, he answered "no" to question 17, which asks, "Have you ever received 
other than an honorable discharge from the military?"  At the hearing, he testified he misunderstood the question, and he answered "no" because his discharge 
was "under honorable conditions."  He denied intentionally falsifying his answer to question 17.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A>  His DD Form 214, Report of Separation from Active Duty, 
shows he was separated "under honorable conditions."<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Some time in 2003, Applicant sold a car and neglected to notify his city of residence of the sale, causing him to be billed for personal property taxes.  After 
learning of the debt as a result of receiving the SOR, he paid it.  The city records show no outstanding taxes due.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Except for the child support arrearage, Applicant has no large financial obligations.  He uses a debit card instead of a credit card.  His car is paid for.  He has no 
mortgage payments, but he shares the costs of their residence with his significant other.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is highly regarded among the State Department officials whom he supports, his colleagues and supervisors.  A State Department official regards him 
as "unusually hard working, practical and efficient," and "especially diligent on all issues regarding security."<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A>  Two other State Department officials submitted 
testimonials to his expertise, dedication, and generosity; one of them characterized him as "an upright and honorable man worthy of trust and respect."<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A written testimonial from one of Applicant's colleagues describes him as "responsive, patient, and considerate," and a person who is relied-upon and trusted 
by the persons he supports.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A> Another colleague testified at the hearing and stated he was familiar with his criminal background, but considers him trustworthy 
based on their personal and professional interaction over a 4-year period.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_49_"><SUP> (49)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's supervisor regards him as a "model employee" and states he is "loyal, discrete, and worthy of a national security clearance."<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_50_"><SUP> (50)</SUP></A> His most recent 
performance evaluation was outstanding, and he was awarded a monetary bonus based on his performance.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_51_"><SUP> (51)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is active in community affairs.  He recently was commended by the local chief of police for his crime-fighting activities as part of a Neighborhood 
Watch Program.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_52_"><SUP> (52)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E: Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under this guideline, conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l.  A disqualifying condition (DC 2) 
applies where there has been a deliberate omission or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire.  Directive 
&para;E2.A5.1.2.2.. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges seven instances where Applicant misstated his year of birth.  Only one, SOR &para; 1.f., involved a personnel security questionnaire.  However, the 
other six involve the same core security concern involving dishonesty, thus requiring the same analysis.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has denied intentional falsification.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it.  Proof of a 
misstatement, standing alone, does not prove an applicant's state of mind when the misstatement occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record 
evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant's state of mind at the time the misstatement 
occurred.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The first three instances, his enlistment in the Army and obtaining driver's licenses in two jurisdictions (SOR &para;&para; 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c.), occurred because he was 
unsure of his birth date and relied on an Army recruiter's representation that his baptismal certificate showed he was born in 1957.  Accordingly to the 
uncontroverted evidence, he did not learn his true birth date until he saw his birth certificate for the first time after his release from prison in 1981.  I conclude 
he has refuted the allegations of intentional falsification alleged in SOR &para;&para; 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant applied for a Social Security card in about 1995 or 1996, he used his driver's license as identification.  Even though the driver's license 
reflected his birth year as 1957, the Social Security Administration continued to list his birth year as 1958.  I conclude he has refuted the allegation of 
intentional falsification alleged in SOR &para; 1.d., because the evidence shows he used his driver's license solely as proof of his identity, not to establish his date of 
birth.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant told a security investigator he entered 1958 as his birth year on building pass application and his SF 86 to be consistent with other government 
records reflecting his birth year as 1958.  I conclude these two instances involve mistaken rather than falsified entries.   He knew 1958 was not his correct birth 
date, but he entered that date under the naive and mistaken belief his answers should be consistent with his Social Security file and other government records.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was not familiar with the security clearance process.  He had just begun working for his current employer, and he clearly did not understand the 
significance of his birth date in determining the temporal scope of a security investigation.  As the record shows, he had nothing to gain by representing himself 
to be two years younger.  He revealed his felony conviction and several delinquent debts on the SF 86, thereby showing lack of intent to falsify.  In a follow-up 
interview with a security investigator, he revealed other derogatory information, such as his "peeping tom" conviction, even though he was not required to 
reveal it on the SF 86.  His security officer believed the entries were mistaken.  Applicant promptly corrected the entries when questioned about them.  He 
enjoys a reputation among colleagues, supervisors, and friends as an honorable and trustworthy person.  Based on his testimony and demeanor at the hearing, as 
well as all the evidence of record, I am satisfied he did not intend to misrepresent a material fact on his building pass application and  SF 86.  Accordingly, I 
conclude DC 2 is not established, and I resolve the allegations in SOR &para;&para; 1.a. through 1.f. in his favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR &para; 1.g. was added at the hearing, with no objection from Applicant.  It alleges he falsely answered "no" to question 17 on his SF 86, asking if he had ever 
received "other than an honorable discharge from the military."  He denied falsification, testifying he found the question confusing.  I found his testimony 
plausible and credible, and I am satisfied he did not intentionally falsify this answer.  The question is poorly phrased and confusing.  It requires careful parsing 
of the differences among "other than an honorable discharge" (the term used in the SF 86), an "other than honorable discharge," and a discharge "under 
honorable conditions."  Applicant received a general discharge "under honorable conditions" and should have answered the question in the negative.  However, 
He reasonably concluded his discharge was not "other than an honorable discharge" because it was not "under other than honorable conditions."  I conclude he 
has refuted the allegation in SOR &para; 1.g., and I resolve it in his favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F: Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under this guideline, "[a]n individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds."  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A 
person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two disqualifying conditions (DC) under this guideline could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  DC 1 applies where an applicant 
has a history of not meeting his or her financial obligations.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.1.  DC 3 applies where an applicant has exhibited inability or unwillingness 
to satisfy debts.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's financial history establishes DC 1.  He is now able and willing to satisfy his debts, but for several years during and following his illness he was 
unable to satisfy all his financial obligations.  Accordingly, I conclude DC 3 is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing the delinquent debts were not recent (MC 1) or constituted "an isolated incident" 
(MC 2).  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.1., E2.A6.1.3.2.  Applicant had multiple delinquent debts that he only recently resolved.  He is still paying off his child support 
arrearage.  I conclude MC 1 and MC 2 are not established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns arising from financial problems also can be mitigated by showing they are the result of conditions beyond the person's control (MC 3).  
Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.3. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Even if financial difficulties initially arose due to circumstances beyond a person's control, an administrative judge should determine 
whether the person acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with the financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 02-02116 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 2003).  
Applicant was unable to work for several years due to his serious illness.  He incurred numerous medical bills partially covered by insurance.  While he was still 
recovering from his illness, he tried to assist his dying father.  When he returned to work, he began resolving his financial problems.  When he learned some 
medical bills had not been fully covered by insurance, he promptly resolved them.  I conclude MC 3 is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing a good-faith effort to resolve debts (MC 6).  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.6.  The 
concept of good faith "requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation."  ISCR 
Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has resolved all the debts alleged in the SOR, except for two.  He has 
rightfully disputed the towing and storage bill, and he has attempted to resolve the small ($123) medical bill but has been unable, because the creditor cannot 
find the records.  I conclude MC 6 is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concern based on 
financial considerations.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J: Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Disqualifying 
conditions may be based on allegations or an applicant's admission of criminal conduct, whether or not charged (DC 1).  Directive, &para; E2.A10.1.2.1. A single 
serious crime or multiple lesser offenses may also be disqualifying (DC 2).  Directive, &para; E2.A10.1.2.2.  Evidence of Applicant's felony conviction in 1979 
establishes DC 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on criminal conduct may be mitigated by showing the criminal behavior was not recent (MC 1) or was an isolated incident (MC 2).  
Directive, &para; E2.A10.1.3.1., E2.A10.1.3.2.  <EM>See also </EM>Directive, &para; E2.2.1.3. (frequency and recency of conduct).  Applicant's felony conviction was more than 26 
years ago.  It is his only conviction except for the minor visual trespass incident five years later and 21 years ago.  I conclude MC 1 and MC 2 are established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal conduct can be mitigated by "clear evidence of successful rehabilitation" (MC 6).  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.3.6. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> "Only with the passage of time will there 
be a track record that shows whether a person, through actions and conduct, is willing and able to adhere to a stated intention to refrain from acting in a way that 
the person has acted in the past."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 97-0727, 1998 DOHA LEXIS 302 at *7 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 1998).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive is silent on what constitutes a sufficient period of reform and rehabilitation.  The sufficiency of an applicant's period of conduct without 
recurrence of past misconduct does not turn on any bright-line rules concerning the length of time needed to demonstrate reform and rehabilitation, but rather 
on a reasoned analysis of the facts and circumstances of an applicant's case based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set 
by the Directive.  If the record evidence shows a significant period of time has passed without evidence of misconduct by an applicant, then the administrative 
judge must articulate a rational basis for concluding why that significant period of time does not demonstrate changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to 
warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.  ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">More than 21 years have passed since Applicant's last brush with the law.  The confluence of his serious illness, the death of his father, and a committed 
relationship with a supportive, responsible partner appear to have changed his attitude and conduct.  He has worked steadily for more than five years with his 
current employer and established an outstanding reputation.  I conclude MC 6 is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR &para; 3.b. alleges Applicant is disqualified from having a clearance under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  By its terms, this statute applies only to an officer or 
employee of the Department of Defense, a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps who is on active duty or is in an active status, or "an officer 
or employee of a contractor of the Department of Defense."  Applicant is working for a contractor of the U.S. Department of State.  His employer has not 
requested a Department of Defense clearance and does not anticipate assigning him to work on any Department of Defense contracts.  Department Counsel 
conceded 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 does not apply to Applicant.<A HREF="03-25413.h1.html#N_53_"><SUP> (53)</SUP></A> I conclude he is not disqualified by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. </SPAN></P>
