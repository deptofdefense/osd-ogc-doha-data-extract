<P>Applicant's criminal conduct would have been mitigated if not for 10 U.S.C 986. Clearance is denied, but waiver recommended.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On February 4, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 3, 2003. The case was assigned to the undersigned on March 19, 2003. A Notice of Hearing was issued on 
arch 26, 2003, and the hearing was held on May 1, 2003. The transcript was received on May 9, 2003.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 39 year old employee of a defense contractor.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>In March 1998, applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While Intoxicated on a Suspended or Revoked License. He was found guilty of the charge, 
sentenced to one year in jail, and his license was suspended for 3 years (Exhibit 14). Applicant actually served eight months in jail (TR at 35).</P> 
 
<P>In February 1995, applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Liquor,  Fleeing Officer,  Possession of Drug Paraphernalia, and 
Assault (two counts). He was found guilty of Driving Under the Influence of Liquor, Fleeing Officer, Possession of Drug Paraphernalia, and one count of 
Assault. He was sentenced to one and one-half years in prison (TR at 33-34).<A HREF="02-05746.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In 1994, applicant was arrested for Disorderly Conduct/Language/Riot. The charges were dismissed. This was an alcohol-related incident (TR at 42-43).</P> 
 
<P>In February 1991, applicant was arrested and charged with Driving with Blood Alcohol over .10%.  He was found guilty and fined.</P> 
 
<P>In August 1991, applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI). He was convicted of the charge (TR at 39).</P> 
 
<P>In 1984 and 1985, applicant was arrested for DUI.</P> 
 
<P>It is obvious from the foregoing history that applicant had quite an alcohol problem. All of the criminal activity alleged in the SOR was alcohol-related, as were 
applicant's financial difficulties. Applicant readily admits he had an alcohol problem, and that it caused a lot of "heartache," but testified that he is "a different 
person now" (TR at 18). The facts support this assertion.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant testified credibly that he has not consumed alcohol since the date of his last arrest in March 1998 (TR at 18). This testimony was corroborated by the 
testimony of his wife, mother, mother-in-law, and supervisor. Shortly after he was released from jail in late 1999 or early 2000, he attended and successfully 
completed a 20 hour alcohol relapse prevention program.<A HREF="02-05746.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant testified credibly that he no longer has "the need or desire for alcohol" (TR at 19), and he 
does not intend to consume it in the future.</P> 
 
<P>Since he stopped consuming alcohol five years ago, applicant's life has turned around. He has not been involved in any additional criminal activity; he has 
much better relationships with his wife, his parents and his children; his financial condition has greatly improved;<A HREF="02-05746.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and according to his current supervisor, he 
does "topnotch"work for his employer (TR at 50).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's mother testified that since applicant stopped drinking five years ago he is "more reliable, more loving, more caring with his family, his children, 
and with (her) too" (TR at 67). Applicant's mother-in-law testified that since he stopped drinking, applicant is "just a new person, completely new person" (TR 
at 77).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth Guidelines (divided into conditions that could raise security concerns and conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns) which must be followed by the Administrative Judge. Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the following Guidelines are applicable:</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Disqualifying Conditions:</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. Alcohol-related incidents away from work.</P> 
 
<P>5. Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of</P> 
 
<P>impaired judgment.  </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigating Conditions:</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>2. The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem.</P> 
 
<P>3. Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Disqualifying Conditions</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>1. A history of not meeting financial obligations.</P> 
 
<P>5. Financial problems linked to alcoholism.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Mitigating Conditions</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>6. The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue</P> 
 
<P>creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Disqualifying Conditions</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>2. A single serious crime or multiple lessor offenses.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Mitigating Conditions</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. The criminal behavior was not recent.</P> 
 
<P>6. There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>In addition to the formal Guidelines discussed above,  Enclosure 2 of the Directive provides that each decision should take into consideration the following 
factors:</P> 
 
<P>The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct;</P> 
 
<P>The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation;</P> 
 
<P>The frequency and recency of the conduct;</P> 
 
<P>The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct;</P> 
 
<P>The voluntariness of participation;</P> 
 
<P>The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;</P> 
 
<P>The motivation for the conduct;</P> 
 
<P>The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and</P> 
 
<P>The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guideline G, the evidence establishes that applicant had a severe alcohol problem from sometime in the 1980s to March 1998. His alcohol-related criminal conduct, standing alone, establishes this fact. The evidence further establishes, however, that for whatever reason, his last arrest in March 1998 
provided him with both the insight and the willpower to overcome his alcohol dependence. The evidence clearly establishes that applicant (1) has not consumed 
any alcohol during the past five years, (2) no longer has the desire to consume alcohol, and (3) with the support of his wife and family, is firmly committed to 
abstaining from the use of alcohol. Given these facts, and the overwhelming evidence of a complete change in his lifestyle, I conclude that in all likelihood, 
applicant's abuse of alcohol will not recur. Accordingly, Guideline G is found for applicant.</P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guideline J, the evidence establishes that applicant's significant criminal conduct has all been alcohol-related. Because I concluded that 
applicant is unlikely to abuse alcohol in the future, I further conclude that applicant is unlikely to engage in criminal conduct in the future. </P> 
 
<P>If it were not for 10 U.S.C. 986, I would conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant applicant access to classified information at the 
present time under Guideline J. However, in light of this statute, I must conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant applicant a 
security clearance. However, I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.</P> 
 
<P>With respect to applicant's child support debt, he fell behind on his payments when he was incarcerated (TR at 36). Applicant and his wife took out a loan 
which has been used to satisfy this past-due debt. Although applicant's failure to pay child support in a timely manner is not condoned, given his incarceration it 
is understandable, and in light of his recent good-faith effort to satisfy the child support debt, his financial misconduct is mitigated. Given this fact, and the lack 
of any evidence that applicant is currently experiencing financial difficulties, Guideline F is found for applicant.</P>
