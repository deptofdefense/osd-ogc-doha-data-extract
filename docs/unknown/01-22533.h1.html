<P>Applicant has a history of alcohol-related incidents that include both domestic violence offenses and a DuI incident.  Both his alcohol abuse and prior 
involvement with illegal substances (primarily marijuana) are mitigated by passage of time and positive showing of rehabilitation manifested by sustained 
discontinued use.  Applicant's demonstrated pattern of dishonesty that includes prior theft, unauthorized appropriation of items and money from his employer 
and falsification of his SF-86 (omissions of his drug use) are not mitigated, however, by any credited prompt, good-faith corrections (tolling for alcohol-impairment not available) and raise continuing  security concerns about Applicant's judgment and reliability.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 25, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on August 6, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on September 17, 2003, and was scheduled for 
hearing on November 5, 2003.  A hearing was convened on November 5, 2003, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of 12 exhibits; Applicant relied 
on four witnesses (including himself) and eight exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on November 24, 2003.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations</SPAN>.  He denied purchasing any illegal drugs between 1990 and 1995, and he denied 
deliberately falsifying his September 1998 SF-86.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant began abusing alcohol as a freshman in college.  He frequently drank on the weekends at dorm parties where kegs of beer were generally available.  
At these parties, he would  typically consume between four and eight beers over the course of an evening, which generally intoxicated him.  Applicant 
continued this pattern of drinking throughout his four years of college attendance.  During his college tenure (around 1987 or 1988), Applicant was charged 
with contributing to the delinquency of a minor.  Because this charge was dismissed without probative facts from which to draw inferences, adverse findings 
regarding this charged incident are necessarily limited.  The most that can be inferred is that Applicant was drinking prior to the incident at a college party.  This 
makes the incident an alcohol-related one (R.T., at 71-72).  Applicant also admits to having sexual intercourse with a minor (in 1988 or 1989) while in college.  
At the time, he didn't know she was under age and was never prosecuted for the offense. </P> 
 
<P>After graduating from college in 1990 and finding both a girlfriend and professional employment, Applicant reduced his drinking considerably.  This abruptly 
changed, though, in 1992 when he became unhappy with both his job and his relationship with his girlfriend (A).  To cope with his added stress he drank more 
frequently, and by 1992 was drinking nightly at the rate of 8 to 12 beers in an evening.  Using alcohol as an escape mechanism, Applicant began to experience 
profound changes in his behavior; negative changes included increased impatience, aggressive actions and intolerance.  Still, he persisted with his drinking on a 
daily basis for about five years (to February 1997), or until he and A broke up. </P> 
 
<P>After breaking up with A (in February 1997), Applicant returned to binge drinking for the ensuing six months, alternating patterns of drinking heavily for two 
weeks at a time with abstaining for a couple of weeks.  Over this six-month time frame, he estimates to have drank to intoxication on about four occasions.  
Typically, he consumed 6 to 12 beers a day.  This he acknowledged during </P> 
 
<P>an court-ordered alcohol evaluation in connection with a 1996 alcohol-related incident. </P> 
 
<P>During particularly heavy drinking episodes between 1993 and February 1997, Applicant's relationship with A often turned violent.  Their weekly physical 
exchanges were most always preceded by drinking to intoxication levels.   On one such occasion (in January 1995), A reported Applicant to police, claiming 
domestic assault.  Following each report police were dispatched to check Applicant.  In the first of his three alcohol-related arrests, Applicant was charged with 
third degree domestic assault, to which he plead guilty and was granted a two-year deferred sentence, conditioned on his attending 36 weeks of domestic 
violence counseling and paying court costs.  Applicant had consumed alcohol prior to the incident and was engaged in an intense argument with A over the 
issue of disciplining A's children (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2; R.T., at 66-67).</P> 
 
<P>In a second incident involving a physical exchange (in March 1996), Applicant was arrested and charged with third degree assault.  He appeared in court on the 
charge in September 1997.  After the third degree assault charge was substituted with harassment and child abuse charges, Applicant pleaded guilty to 
harassment; the child abuse charge was then dismissed.  Applicant, in turn, was placed on probation for 18 months, ordered to pay court costs, and ordered to 
attend 36 weeks of domestic counseling.  Applicant had consumed alcohol prior to the incident giving rise to his arrest, enough to make the incident alcohol-related (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2; R.T., at 59, 66).  </P> 
 
<P>Alcohol was also the source of a second arrest of Applicant in 1996.  In April 1996 he was arrested and charged with DuI and driving under the influence/Blood 
Alcohol Content (BAC) of  .010 per cent or more (with his BAC measuring 0.176 per cent).  Applicant had consumed beer with a friend at a local pool hall.  
Over a two-hour period he split three pitchers of beer with the friend and was on his way home when he was stopped by the arresting officer for a faulty tail 
light.  The officer administered a breathalyzer to Applicant, which Applicant failed, registering a 0.176 per cent BAC.  Appearing in court in September 1997 
for both his driving under the influence charges and earlier domestic violence charges, he pled guilty to the DuI charge and was placed on 18 months probation, 
sentenced to 30 days of imprisonment on work release, and an additional 30 days of imprisonment (suspended), and ordered to pay costs, complete 24 hours of 
useful public service, attend Level II alcohol education and attend 40 hours of therapy.   Applicant had consumed beer with a friend at a local pool hall. </P> 
 
<P>By all accounts Applicant satisfied the terms and conditions of his 1997 plea arrangement.  Besides completing his counseling and alcohol therapy (which 
included AA meetings), Applicant fully complied with the terms of the restraining order placed on him that prohibited any contact with A.  Applicant 
acknowledged being an alcoholic and pledged to his fellow AA members to remain abstinent.  His treatment counselor (Ms. D of A Group) made no alcohol 
diagnosis of Applicant, though, and found Applicant to have used good judgment during his treatment sessions (spanning August 1998 and January 1999) and 
made appropriate  adjustments in his life to enhance his judgment decisions (<EM>see</EM> ex. C)</P> 
 
<P>But after several months of avoiding the abuse of alcohol during his counseling sessions with A Group (between August 1998 and January 1999), Applicant 
returned to heavy drinking.  Between February 1999 and June 1999 Applicant drank weekly and drank to the point of intoxication on 6 to 12 separate occasions, 
mostly in restaurants or at parties, but occasionally at home as well (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3).  Applicant often missed work and experienced blackouts as the result of his 
abusive drinking.</P> 
 
<P>Between February 1997 and May 2000, Applicant was involved in a stormy personal relationship with B that entailed angry exchanges that sometimes escalated 
to physical violence.  Applicant's continued drinking and low esteem during this relationship impaired his ability to cope with their problems.  One of their 
many exchanges even resulted in an domestic violence arrest of Applicant.  Following a June 1999 evening with B in which both consumed alcoholic beverages 
and became intoxicated, Applicant and B engaged in a particularly heated argument.  During the course of the exchange, Applicant hit B in the face with the 
telephone.  B went next door and called the police who responded.  Upon their arrival at B's home, the police took her statement and confirmed she had been 
injured.  With this information they went to Applicant's home to get his account. After determining that Applicant and B assaulted each other, the police 
arrested and charged Applicant with third degree assault and harassment.   When he appeared in court in November 1999 to respond to the charges, he pled 
guilty to the charges and was placed on 24 months probation and sentenced to 20 days of imprisonment with work release.  Additionally, he was ordered to 
attend weekly AA meetings throughout his probation, attend 16 individual counseling sessions, attend 36 weeks of domestic violence counseling, abstain from 
alcohol and pay the $138.00 in court costs (<EM>see</EM> ex. 5).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant voluntarily sought counseling from a certified domestic violence treatment provider (T Services) following his June 1999 domestic violence arrest. In 
his initial evaluation with T Services he acknowledged consuming 60 to 70 bottles of beer a week (<EM>see</EM> ex. 12).  He is credited by the counseling service with 
making good progress in endeavoring to understand his problems and devise ways to cope with them (<EM>see</EM> exs. 12 and D).  His counseling reports covering the 
period of November 1999 through August 2000 credit his progress in anger control, marked by decreasing slips (<EM>see</EM> ex. 12), and he is credited with successfully 
completing the domestic violence counseling program. Throughout the period of his counseling, Applicant acknowledged himself to be an alcoholic; albeit he 
has never been diagnosed as alcohol dependent. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has maintained his sobriety since June 1999.  He still attends domestic violence classes, though not required, regularly attends AA meetings (<EM>see </EM>ex. 
4; R.T., at 57, 63-64), and has a sponsor (K) who attests to (I) Applicant's maintained sobriety over the past four years, (ii) his regular AA attendance, (iii) and 
his participation in chapter assignments.  Applicant is currently working on his ninth step (making amends) in his AA program and recognizes a higher power 
as a necessary part of his continuing recovery from alcoholism.  Today he tries to live within himself and no longer relies on alcohol to cover up his problems.  
Applicant has not consumed alcohol since June 1999 (a period of over four years) and commits to continued abstinence.   From his AA chapter he has regularly 
received chips commemorating his self imposed sobriety: the last chip he received commemorated four years of sobriety (R.T., at 111).   None of his colleagues 
at work have seen Applicant consuming alcohol at company functions since 1998.</P> 
 
<P>Besides alcohol, Applicant abused drugs earlier in his life.  Most of his admitted drug use occurred while he was a college student.  He did continue to use and 
purchase marijuana for several years after he left college (<EM>i.e., </EM>to 1995) before giving up illegal drugs altogether.</P> 
 
<P>While drinking excessively during the first three years following his college completion, Applicant frequently shoplifted.  Between 1991 and 1993 he estimates 
to have removed approximately $500.00 to $1,000.00 worth of merchandise from local retail outlets.  In a similar vein, Applicant abused his employer's trust; 
when near the end of his employment with X company in August 1995, he took software from the company without permission.  In addition to taking company 
software without permission, he also failed to notify his X Company employer of his overpayment of vacation time.  Following his layoff from X Company, he 
falsified his unemployment certification.  As a result of his mis-certification, he received unemployment benefits of approximately $530.00.   Applicant was 
never prosecuted for any of his actions.  To date, he has not made restitution for any of the items he misappropriated.</P> 
 
<P>While battling alcohol and domestic relations problems, Applicant receiving notices from the IRS and state taxing about his multiple failures to file tax returns.  
He had delayed filing both his 1998 and 1999 returns until after he had achieved some stability in his sobriety: in June 2001 (R.T., at 93-94).  In filing his 1998 
and 1999 federal and state tax returns, he failed to list $9,000.00 in income from his rental properties.  Applicant has since entered into installment 
arrangements with the IRS to repay the back taxes claimed by the IRS to be owing and has repaid owed back taxes (R.T., at 93).</P> 
 
<P>Asked to complete his SF-86 in September 1998, Applicant failed to acknowledge the illegal drugs he had used and purchased within the previous seven years 
(marijuana) when responding to questions 27 and 29.  Applicant attributes his omissions to concerns about his job and clearance and figured he could get 
through by fudging (R.T., at 94, 97-98).  While Applicant claims to have been alcohol-impaired during this period, his A Group records credit him with 
considerable progress with his drinking during his treatment sessions (<EM>i.e., </EM>August 1998 and January 1999), and with the exception of recurrent drinking 
between February and June 1999, sustained abstinence thereafter, enough to nullify any alcohol role in either his omissions or his failure to come forward 
earlier with his drug and wage garnishment disclosures (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 69-71).  Considering all of the surrounding circumstances of Applicant's marijuana 
omissions in his 1998 SF-86, inferences warrant they were made knowingly and wilfully. </P> 
 
<P>In the same 1998 SF-86, Applicant omitted the garnishment of his wages to cover ordered child support arrearage (since brought current) in October 1993, 
which at that time totaled $5,280.00  (<EM>see</EM> ex. 11).  Applicant claims he interpreted the language in the order calling for biweekly child support payments to be 
made out of his wages to be nothing more than court ordered payments, not enforcement action through wage garnishment (R.T., at 82-83, 104).  The language 
in the court's child support order is less than clear about the means of collection (ex. 11).  Without more clarity in the order, Applicant's version of his 
understanding cannot in characterized as implausible.  His explanations, as such, are accepted and enable him to avert inferences of deliberate falsification of 
question 34 re: wage garnishment action as a means of enforcing collection of his child support arrearage.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was interviewed by a DSS agent in February 1999, and again in January 2001.  In neither of these interviews did Applicant volunteer any disclosure 
of his most recent marijuana activity.  He was not asked about drug involvement and provided no acknowledgments of his marijuana use and purchases within 
the seven years preceding the completion of his SF-86.  But Applicant reconsidered his omission after his second interview and called DSS to schedule another 
interview.  As the result of his call, a third DSS interview was scheduled (this one with another DSS agent) in February 2001 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 4).  In this third interview 
Applicant voluntarily disclosed all of his prior illegal drug activity (including  his most recent marijuana involvement in 1995) to the agent,  as well as his wage 
garnishment to cover his child support arrearage.  Applicant is credited with making his disclosures voluntarily without being  first prompted by Agent B. Both 
when he executed his SF-86 and during the considerable intervening period following his submission of his materially flawed SF-86, Applicant manifested no 
signs of alcohol impairment, save for a brief period of recurrent abusive drinking between February and June 1999.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is well regarded by his supervisor and coworkers as an outstanding and trusted engineer who consistently goes out of the way to help his team 
members.  His performance evaluations covering the period of June 1998 through of June 2002 reflect outstanding contributions (<EM>see </EM>ex. A).</P>

and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from 
the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a praiseworthy civilian record, but also a record of domestic violence and other alcohol-related incidents over a number of years, prior drug use, 
shoplifting, employment breaches, court-ordered wage garnishment to collect child support arrearage, intercourse with a minor, income omissions in filed 
federal and state tax returns, and falsification of a security application form.  These incidents and actions have raised Government concerns over Applicant's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness: requisites for determining his eligibility to access classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Alcohol-related issues</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Beginning in college, Applicant drank excessively, often to intoxication, before he gave up alcohol altogether in 1999.  His drinking occasionally caused him to 
miss work and experience blackouts. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> His drinking also contributed to domestic violence incidents as well as a DuI.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Over a period of five years spanning January 1995 and June 1999 Applicant was involved in four alcohol-related incidents, two of which involved domestic 
violence visited on Applicant's first girlfriend (A).  His last alcohol-related incident (in June 1999) involved Applicant physically  shoving child of his second 
girlfriend (B), albeit not seriously enough to cause any injuries to the child.  Applicant's four alcohol-related incidents reflect serious alcohol abuse by 
Applicant, even without proof of intoxication in all of the incidents, and documented proof of his having a recurring problem with alcohol through June 1999.  
Never diagnosed as an abusive drinker or alcohol dependent, Applicant, nonetheless, binged regularly (interrupted by brief periods of light to moderate 
drinking).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following his April 1996 DuI conviction, Applicant enrolled in A group's alcohol treatment program, whose services were primarily of an educational nature.  
While he was never diagnosed or evaluated  for an alcohol problem (despite his acknowledging consuming 6 to 12 beers daily) he was credited by his group 
counselors with making good progress in learning more about alcohol abuse.   Still in denial about his alcohol problem, however, he returned to abusive 
drinking after concluding his sessions with A Group.  Under these circumstances Applicant's counseling services cannot be characterized as successful.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having resumed his drinking after each of his first three alcohol-related incidents, Applicant manifested not only denial of any potential alcohol problems 
associated with his drinking but also his unwillingness to seek meaningful treatment and  aftercare in a controlled setting.  On the strength of the evidence 
presented, three disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Adjudication Guidelines for alcohol consumption may be applied: DC 1 (alcohol-related incidents away 
from work), DC 2 (alcohol-related incidents at work) and DC 5 (habitual or binge drinking).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Assessment of Applicant's alcohol-related conduct must be made on the basis of a review of the entire evidentiary record developed to date, not merely the 
information developed with respect to his identified four alcohol-related offenses.  In making an overall assessment of Applicant's clearance eligibility, major 
emphasis must be accorded his most recent drinking history, his recurrent returns to abusive drinking after short periods of abstinence, his most recent favorable 
evaluations from his domestic violence counselors, and his sustained abstinence over more than four years with the aid of AA. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By his actions and improved understanding (which includes his acknowledged alcoholic condition) Applicant demonstrates he has taken the necessary 
restorative and corrective measures in his personal affairs to ensure that he does not repeat the same or similar judgment lapses associated with his prior 
problems with alcohol abuse.  His mitigation efforts reflect sustained sobriety and vigorous AA participation over a four year period that is corroborated by not 
only earned chips commemorating his sobriety, but the praise of his sponsor and others familiar with his work history.  His acceptance and recovery efforts have 
been recognized not only by his sponsor, but his work colleagues as well, who have observed no signs of Applicant drinking around the work environment or in 
social situations. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the record as a whole, Applicant makes a convincing showing that he has both the maturity and resource support at his disposal to avert any 
recurrent problems with judgment lapses related to alcohol and criminal conduct.  He is manifestly on the right path to maintaining permanent abstinence.  
Favorable conclusions are warranted with respect to the criminal implications of his alcohol-related incidents (covered by Guidelines G and J).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, Applicant's shoplifting activities and contributing to the delinquency of a minor offense were not shown to have been alcohol-related and raise 
independent security concerns.  That they were either never prosecuted at all or were dismissed is not dispositive.  Our Appeal Board has repeatedly stated that 
the government can prove applicant engagement in criminal conduct, even in the absence of a criminal conviction.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 94-1213 (June 7, 1996).  
Accordingly, as to these covered actions, two of the disqualifying conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines for criminal conduct may be invoked: DC 1 
(criminal conduct regardless of whether the person was formally charged) and DC 2 (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) may be applied to the 
facts at hand.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Still, these non-alcohol related actions of Applicant are aged and have not been repeated. Accordingly, both of these covered-allegations are subject to two of 
the mitigating conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines for criminal conduct: MC 1 (criminal behavior not recent) and MC 2 (isolated incident) and overall are 
mitigated. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Drug issues</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As a college student, Applicant experimented with various illegal substances: marijuana, LSD, cocaine and mushrooms (psilocybin).  Except for the marijuana, 
he ceased all further involvement with drugs after he graduated from college.  However, he continued using and purchasing marijuana recreationally for several 
more years before quitting altogether in 1995. Two disqualifying conditions apply here: DC 1 (any drug abuse) and DC 2 (purchase and possession).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has not returned to drug use since 1995 and with his benefit of counseling and a strong AA program, he assures he will not return to drugs in the 
future.  Applicant's assurances are backed by a considerable period of demonstrated abstinence.  That he didn't disclose his past involvement when he executed 
his SF-86 is of some concern when gauging his credibility <EM>vis-a-vis </EM>future drug involvement, but his omissions are more than counterbalanced by his 
demonstrated avoidance of illegal drugs over a period of many years and strong network support.  To his benefit, Applicant take advantage of two mitigating 
conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines for drugs: MC 1( not recent) and MC 3 (demonstrated intent not abuse drugs in the future).  Applicant mitigates 
security concerns associated with his past abuse of illegal drugs, enough to enable</SPAN> safe predictable judgments about his ability to avoid recurrent drug 
involvement.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by Guideline H.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Falsification and judgment issues</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Potentially serious and difficult  to reconcile with the trust and reliability requirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of 
Applicant's omission of his illegal drug use and purchases in his September 1998 SF-86, and in his first two DSS interviews that followed.  So much trust is 
imposed on persons cleared to see classified information that deviation tolerances for incidents of trust betrayal are calibrated narrowly. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By omitting his past marijuana use/purchases, Applicant concealed materially important background information needed for the Government to properly 
process and evaluate his security clearance application.   Applicant's omission is inferentially attributable to his concern about how disclosure of the adverse 
information would impact on his employment and clearance: understandable certainly, but historically considered by our Appeal Board to be insufficient to 
avert drawn conclusions of knowing and wilful concealment. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's omission was knowing, deliberate, and material to a determination about his clearance suitability.  It invites application of Disqualifying Condition 
(DC) for personal conduct of the Adjudicative Guidelines: DC 2 (falsification of a security questionnaire).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with,  since he failed to take advantage of the first two opportunities afforded him to correct his earlier SF-86 omission 
in his initial DSS interviews following completion of his 1998 SF-86.  Not only has our Appeal Board found the use of Mitigating Condition (MC) 2 of the 
Adjudicative Guidelines for personal conduct (isolated, corrected falsification) to be unavailable to applicants seeking mitigation by treating the omission as 
isolated, but it has denied applicants availability of MC 3 (prompt, good faith disclosure) as well in circumstances (as here) where the applicant has failed to 
take advantage of an earlier DSS interview opportunity.  <EM>Compare </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-23365 (March 22, 2004) and ISCR Case No. 97-0289 (January 1998) 
with DISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 1995).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's explanations for delaying his disclosure preclude him from taking advantage of either MC 2 (isolated omissions) or MC 3 (prompt, good faith 
correction of the falsification) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal conduct, and from mitigating Government security concerns associated with his 
deliberate omissions.  Not only is precedent lacking for tolling the promptness prong of MC 3 due to alcohol impairment, there is nothing in the record to 
document Applicant's being physically impaired when he executed the SF-86 in September 1998, or in the ensuing few months that followed, save for a brief 
period of recurrent alcohol abuse in 1999.  Applicant's tolling claim must, accordingly, be rejected. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's history of child support arrearage enforcement measures, his unauthorized receipt of software and unemployment payment benefits, his sexual 
relationship with a minor while a college student, and his income exclusions from his federal and state tax returns reflect serious judgment lapses, too, and 
cannot be separated from his SF-86 omissions when assessing the security significance of his judgment and trust deficiencies covered by the personal conduct 
allegations of the SOR.  Together they form  a pattern of dishonesty, for which DC 5 (pattern of dishonesty or rule violations) of the Adjudicative Guidelines 
for personal conduct is applicable. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In Applicant's favor, he satisfied his child support arrearage.  He is also credited with filing amended tax returns and satisfying any additional taxes owing as 
the result of his previously unreported rental property income.  This conduct is, accordingly, mitigated.  So are any judgment lapses associated with his having a 
sexual affair with a minor while in college mitigated; this conduct is aged, disputed as to Applicant's understanding of the girl's age at the time, and was never, 
in any event, prosecuted.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available guidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E.2.2 factors), unfavorable conclusions 
warrant, however, with respect to subparagraphs 4.b, 4.c, and 4.f and 4.g covered by Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P>
