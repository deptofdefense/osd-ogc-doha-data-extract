<P>Applicant's brother is a citizen and resident of Afghanistan and a high-ranking official in the Afghan government.  She has regular contact with him and has recently visited him twice for three or four 
months at a time.  She has one nephew and one niece who are citizens of Afghanistan residing in the U.S.  The security concern based on foreign influence is not mitigated.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>On October 28, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a security clearance. 
This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, 
<EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  It 
alleges Applicant's brother is a citizen and resident of Afghanistan (&para; 1.a) that her brother is currently the Minister of Commerce of Afghanistan and formerly served as a Vice President of Afghanistan 
(&para; 1.b), she has three other relatives who are citizens of Afghanistan (&para; 1.c), she traveled to Afghanistan from September 2003 to December 2003 and August 2004 to December 2004 and stayed with her 
brother (&para; 1.d), and she was employed by Ariana Afghan Airlines from January 1970 to January 1978 and had regular contact with foreign diplomats and regularly attended diplomatic functions (&para; 1.e).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on November 12, 2005, admitted the allegations, and requested a hearing.  </SPAN>The case was assigned to me on April 20, 2006.  On May 16, 2006, DOHA issued a 
notice of hearing setting the case for June 1, 2006.  The case was heard as scheduled.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 9, 2006.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 58-year-old linguist who has applied for employment by a federal contractor.   (Tr. 56.)  She speaks Farsi, Pashto, Urdu, and English.  (GX 3 at 13.)  She was tested and found qualified to 
translate in Pashto.  She does not speak Arabic, the predominant language of al Qaeda.  (Tr. 51.)  She applied for the job because she wants to help the Americans in Afghanistan.  (Tr. 48.)  If she 
receives a security clearance, she will work as a translator in Afghanistan.  (Tr. 57.)  She has never held a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Kabul, Afghanistan.  She completed high school and attended the University of Kabul from January to December 1969.  She came to the U.S. in November 1978 to escape the 
Communist government.  She entered the U.S. on a tourist visa and then applied for political asylum.  (Tr. 64.)  She became a U.S. citizen in April 1997.  (Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at 1-2; GX 3 at 
2.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant worked for Ariana Afghan Airlines from January 1970 to January 1978, where she was a cargo supervisor, responsible for handling diplomatic packages for the airline.  While she was 
employed by the airline, she had contact with numerous embassies three to five times a week to process diplomatic cargo through customs.  Because of her frequent contact with the embassies, she was 
invited to diplomatic receptions once or twice a year.  (Tr. 60.)  None of her business contacts with the embassies developed into personal ties.  (Government Exhibit (GX) 2 at 2-3.)  She has had no 
contact with former airline employees or embassy staff members since 1978.  (Tr. 60-61.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents are deceased.  She has seven siblings, two brothers and five sisters.  One brother is deceased.  (GX 1 at 3-4.)  All her siblings left Afghanistan shortly after she left.  (Tr. 63.)  All her 
siblings except one brother are now citizens and residents of the U.S. (Tr. 63.)  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's brother is a citizen and resident of Afghanistan.  He grew up and went to high school in Kabul.  He continued his education in the U.S. and obtained a doctoral degree from a U.S. university.  
He lived in the U.S. and worked for the World Bank between 1969 and 1987.  He did not become a permanent U.S. resident or apply for U.S. citizenship because he did not want to jeopardize any future 
opportunity to return to Afghanistan and restore its government.  (Tr. 95-96.)  He returned to Afghanistan in 1987 to join the resistance against Soviet occupation, and he served three years as the 
Finance Minister of the Afghan interim government in exile.   He has been a strong advocate of the peace process and part of the Afghan government since December 2001.  (HX VII)  He served as 
inister of Finance for six months and then was a Vice-President for two and a half hears.  He has been the Minister of Commerce since January 2005.  (Applicant's Exhibit (AX) B.)  His wife is a 
native-born U.S. citizen residing in the U.S. (Tr. 93.)  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant talks to her brother in Afghanistan every three or four months.  (Tr. 74.)  She visited Afghanistan and stayed with her brother from September to December 2003 and again from August to 
December 2004.  (GX 2 at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has numerous nieces and nephews, of which only two are not U.S. citizens.  Both reside in the U.S., and one has applied for U.S. citizenship.  (Tr. 70.)  She sees them about once a year.  (Tr. 
71.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Afghanistan is an emerging democracy, but its government ministries and institutions are in their infancy.  The government is still in the process of establishing its policies and procedures and dealing 
with its security, legal, commercial, and infrastructure problems.  It is a very dangerous place because of U.S. military operations, as well as those of remnants of the former Taliban regime and terrorist 
groups.  Kidnaping and assassinations are commonplace.  The Afghan government is strongly committed to the war on terrorism.  The ability of the Afghan government to maintain order and ensure the 
safety of its citizens as well as visitors is limited.  Similarly, the government's ability to prevent abuses by security forces is limited.  (Hearing Exhibit (HX) I at 1-2; HX II at 1-2; HX III at 71-72, 91, 
92; HX IV at 8-9, 15-16; HX V at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Afghanistan has enormous economic needs, and offers broad opportunities for foreign and domestic investors.  The government remains deeply involved in commerce and the transition to a competitive, 
market economy is moving slowly.  (HX VI at 1-2.)  Applicant's brother is a key player in Afghanistan's economic development. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the 
applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his 
security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each 
guideline.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in 
the Directive &para;&para; 6.3.1. through 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or 
absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation 
or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1. through E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible 
for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an 
applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see 
</EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 
at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The concern under this guideline is that a security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not 
citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress.  "These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may arise when "[a]n immediate family member [spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters], or a person to whom the individual has close ties of 
affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 3) also may arise if an individual has relatives "who are 
connected with any foreign government."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.3.  Applicant's brother's citizenship, residence, and government position are sufficient to establish both DC 1 and DC 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A disqualifying condition (DC 6) may arise from "[c]onduct which may make the individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a foreign government."  I conclude DC 6 is not 
established because Applicant's vulnerability arises from her familial relationship with a high-ranking official of the Afghan government, not her conduct.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the inapplicability of DC 6, Applicant's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure under the broader guideline of Directive &para; E2.2.1.8 is relevant.  She is a likely target because 
of her brother's high position.  The potential for coercion, exploitation, or pressure runs both ways.  She could be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure exerted directly by or indirectly 
through her brother, and her brother could be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure exerted through her and designed to undermine U.S. interests in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Family ties with persons in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, automatically disqualifying under Guideline B. However,  such ties raise a prima facie security concern sufficient to require an 
applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></SPAN></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a 
security clearance for the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.15; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Since the government produced substantial evidence to establish DC 1 and DC 3, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive &para; 
E3.1.15. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In cases where an applicant has immediate family members who are citizens or residents of a foreign country or who are connected with a foreign government, a mitigating condition (MC 1) may apply 
if "the immediate family members, cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to 
choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of MC 1("agents of a foreign power <STRONG>or</STRONG> in a position to be exploited"), it requires proof "that an applicant's family members, cohabitant, or associates in 
question are (a) not agents of a foreign power, <STRONG>and</STRONG> (b) not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United 
States."  ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004). </P> 
 
<P>Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  "The United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or 
country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. 
Bd. May 19, 2004).  The distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with caution.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security.  Afghanistan is now heavily 
dependant on the U.S.  However, as it becomes more self-reliant, it can reasonably be expected to have disagreements with the U.S.  Applicant's brother has strong ties to the U.S., but his first loyalty is 
to Afghanistan.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.</SPAN>  <EM>See</EM> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 
at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation's government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an 
applicant's family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family 
member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's brother is an agent of a foreign power, as that term has been defined by the Appeal Board. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <EM>See</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 02-24254, 2004 WL 2152747 at *4-5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2004).<A HREF="05-07910.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 
<P>  Thus, I 
conclude MC 1 is not established.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A mitigating condition (MC 3) may apply if "[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.3.  There is a rebuttable presumption that contacts 
with an immediate family member in a foreign country are not casual.  ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002).  Applicant has a close and continuing relationship with her brother.  Thus, I 
conclude MC 3 is not established for him.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has only occasional contact with her niece and nephew who are Afghan citizens residing in the U.S.  I conclude MC 3 is established for them, and I resolve SOR &para; 1.c in her favor.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Similarly, Applicant has had no contact with former airline employees and foreign diplomatic staff members whom she met while employed by the airline.  Thus, MC 3 is established for her former 
airline and diplomatic contacts, and I resolve SOR &para; 1.e in her favor.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The totality of an applicant's family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  </SPAN>ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003).  While most of 
Applicant's individual ties do not raise significant security concerns, the totality of those ties raises a serious concern.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating the 
evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The following are my findings as to each allegation in the SOR:</P>
