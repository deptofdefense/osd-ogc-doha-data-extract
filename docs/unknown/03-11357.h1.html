<P>Applicant is a 58-year-old computer programmer for a defense contractor working with medical information for military hospitals concerning appointments. 
She has worked for her present employer for 18 years and has held a security clearance since that time. Applicant came to the U.S. from Taiwan in 1986 to join 
her sister who had emigrated earlier. Two brothers and one sister remain in Taiwan. One brother works for the government in Taiwan in a non-sensitive 
position. She traveled annually to Taiwan for ten years before her father died. Initially, she did not report all of the trips but did so later voluntarily. She has 
mitigated the allegations. Eligibility is granted. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On October 18, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> as amended and modified; DoD Regulation 5200.2-R; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
trustworthiness determination for an ADP clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether 
eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
<P>On November 1, 2004, Applicant, in a sworn written statement, responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was 
assigned to me on January 14, 2005, and  a notice of hearing was issued the same day for a hearing to be held on February 8, 2005. It was held that day and the 
Government introduced six exhibits and the Applicant introduced nine. All of the exhibits were admitted into evidence. The Applicant testified and two 
witnesses testified on her behalf. The transcript was received on February 22, 2005. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted the factual allegations pertaining to her family members but denied the allegations relating to information supplied on her SF 85P 
concerning travel to Taiwan. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. </P> 
<P>After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record the following additional findings of fact are made:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 58-year-old computer programmer for a major defense contractor who works with medical information for hospitals including military hospitals. 
Her particular area concerns medical appointments information to facilitate management. Thus, she is required to have an ADP trustworthiness determination. 
She has worked for her present employer for 18 years and has held a security clearance since that time. </P> 
<P>Applicant came to the U.S. from Taiwan in 1986 to join her sister who had emigrated earlier. Her entire family emigrated from Shanghai to Taiwan in l948 
when the communists came to power. She has two twin brothers and one sister who remain in and are citizens of Taiwan. Only one of the three works for the 
government and he is in a minor position for the Department of Labor Affairs of the Taiwan government, the Republic of China. He is involved in labor 
statistics and has no professional interest in her work nor she in his. She is in communication with her siblings on a regular basis but is not particularly close to 
them. </P> 
<P>Applicant traveled to Taiwan yearly between 1991 and 2001while her father was alive to celebrate his birthday which was a strong family tradition. He died in 
2001. She has had only one occasion since to travel to Taiwan and that was in 2002 after the SF 85P was submitted when a brother-in-law was terminally ill 
with cancer. </P> 
<P>Applicant disclosed her 2001 trip to Taiwan on her SF 85P and a subsequent affidavit but not the yearly trips for the ten previous years. She did voluntarily 
disclose those trips in an later interrogatories (Exhs. 3 and 4) even though she had not been asked about them. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence</P> 
<P>of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do 
so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The 
applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt 
as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No.12968.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the Guideline and evidence of record, including Applicant's admissions, the Government established reasons to deny her a security clearance because 
of foreign influence. Having established such reasons, the Applicant had the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, 
or extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424 
(App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The applicable guideline in the SOR concerning Foreign Influence-Guideline B provides as a Disqualifying Conditions (DC) that a security risk may exist when 
an individual's immediate family are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. Such facts could create the potential for foreign influence that 
could result in the compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties 
of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in a foreign country. (E2.A2.1.2.1) Such security concerns could be mitigated by a determination "that the 
immediate family members are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to 
choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States." (E2.A2.1.3.1)<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the Guideline and evidence of record, including Applicant's admissions, the Government established reasons to deny her a security clearance because 
of foreign influence. Having established such reasons, the Applicant had the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, 
or extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424 
(App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is an intelligent woman who has many family ties in the United States including her immediate family and fellow workers with whom she has been 
associated the past 18 years. She has held a security clearance during that time, a time during which she had the same relatives that are now alleged to raise 
security concerns plus her father who is now deceased. Her contacts with her relatives in Taiwan are regular but there is no indication that such creates a 
security concern. Her travels were for a specific reason but since the death of her father is no longer likely to occur with the same frequency. There has been no 
evidence during the time that she has held a clearance that she had the slightest inclination of loyalty to the Republic of China over that to the United States. 
The testimony of Applicant and her witnesses was persuasive. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Her supervisor testified as to her devotion to her work, her dedication to the U.S., and her candor in telling her employer about the trips she took to Taiwan over 
the past years. Her brother-in -law, a chief of his medical specialty at a leading West coast hospital, who is married to the sister who brought her to the U.S., 
testified as to her interests, vaules, trustworthiness, and his belief of her value to the country and her loyalty to it. I conclude that she has sufficiently established 
facts to apply mitigating condition 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The other applicable Guideline cited in the SOR concerns Personal Conduct Guideline E relating to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">conduct involving questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not 
properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material 
facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. (E2.A5.1.2.2.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include the fact that the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has 
subsequently provided correct information voluntarily. (E2.A5.1.3.2.) A second mitigating condition is that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to 
correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts. (E2.A5.1.3.3.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While she did not reveal all of her trips to Taiwan on her SF 85P and her affidavit of February 13, 2003, she did volunteer the information on two subsequent 
interrogatories (Exh. 3 and 4) and gave plausible reasons for the omission from the SF 85P. The government conceded at the hearing that she had voluntarily 
came forth with the information even though it had not been specifically requested. Thus, I conclude that the omissions were not deliberate as required by the 
guideline. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The "whole person" concept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits 
taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that she is trustworthy and 
reliable and that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a favorable trustworthy determination to Applicant. </SPAN></P>
