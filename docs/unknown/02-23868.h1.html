<P>Applicant, born in the Republic of China (Taiwan), came to the United States in 1971 and became a United States citizen in 1981.  His wife and  two children 
are also United States citizens. He has a mother, two brothers, a sister and a mother-in-law, who are citizens of Taiwan and reside in Taiwan. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His contacts with 
them are infrequent. None of these family members, belong to, participate in, or are active with any government agency of Taiwan.  They are not in a position to 
be exploited by Taiwan in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to these family members and his loyalty to the United States.  Applicant's

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated October 31, 
2003, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct 
proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, or denied. The SOR was based on Foreign Influence (Guideline B) concerns because of the 
foreign residency and/or citizenship of close family members.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant, through his attorney, <EM></EM> filed a notarized response, dated December 1, 2003, to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing before a 
DOHA Administrative Judge. On February 2, 2004, the case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing. Pursuant to formal notice dated 
February 12, 2004, a hearing was held on March 26, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered three documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1-3) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered 51 
documentary exhibits (Exhibits A-YY) and offered his own testimony, and that of three additional witnesses. The transcript (TR) was received on April 15, 
2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Foreign Influence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) of the Directive. The SOR contains six 
allegations, 1.a., through </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f.,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under Guideline B. Applicant admitted all of the facts upon which the SOR allegations were made except 1.b.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The admitted 
allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testimony of

employment in the defense sector. He first received a security clearance in 1977, which was retained through background investigations in 1983 and 1987 
(Exhibit 1).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Taiwan. He served in the Taiwanese military for one year in 1969 to 1970 (Exhibit HH). He came to the United States in 1971, and

Neither Applicant nor his wife has any regular contact with any of these brothers, and as far as Applicant knows, none of therm are employed by the Taiwanese

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">last traveled to Taiwan in 2001, where he stayed for two days during a family trip to Thailand.  Previously, he traveled to Taiwan in 1999 to attend 
the funeral of his father.

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> considered</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, etc. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following guidelines and concerns most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>FOREIGN INFLUENCE (GUIDELINE B) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.<EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM></EM>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department of the Navy v. Egan</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 484 U.S. 518, 531</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, 
influence or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established a 
reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a mother, four brothers, a sister, and mother-in-law,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
who are citizens of and reside in</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Taiwan. The Taiwan citizenship and residency of Applicant's family create the potential for foreign influence that could result 
in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties 
raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for him. This </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has done. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The evidence of Applicant's family members, who are citizens of and reside in Taiwan comes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1, "immediate 
family members, or persons to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, who are citizens of, or resident in, a foreign country."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The primary factors in mitigation that I have considered include: Applicant's long history since coming to the United States in 1971 and becoming a U. S. 
citizen with his wife in 1981; the lack of government involvement of Applicant's family members and the extremely limited and infrequent contact he has with 
them;  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">his devotion to his wife and children; and his strong feelings concerning this country</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  Based on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the 
evidence,  I have determined that his family in Taiwan does not constitute an unacceptable security risk, and the Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A2.1.3.1, "a 
determination that the immediate family member(s). . . in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way 
that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States," applies.  MC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.3.3. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">also applies because 
Applicant's contact with his family in Taiwan is extremely casual and infrequent.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">         After considering all of the evidence of record on these issues, I conclude that the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the 
SOR and even in the unlikely event pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would resist it and would  report the incident 
to the proper authorities. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">         </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> On balance, it is concluded that Applicant has overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P>
