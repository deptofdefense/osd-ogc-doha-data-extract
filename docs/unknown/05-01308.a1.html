<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On September 22, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline M (Misuse of Information Technology Systems) and 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided on 
the written record.  On May 26, 2006, after considering the record,  Administrative Judge Arthur E. Marshall, Jr. denied Applicant's request for a security 
clearance.<A HREF="05-01308.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's adverse clearance decision under Guideline E is arbitrary, capricious or 
contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge's adverse clearance decision should be reversed because the Applicant's disqualifying conduct was isolated and 
unintentional.  The Board does not find Applicant's argument persuasive. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's statements about his intent at the time he accessed inappropriate material on the internet were relevant evidence, but they were not binding on the 
Administrative Judge. <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-19278 at 6-7 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 2003). As the trier of fact, the Judge had to consider Applicant's statements 
in light of the record evidence as a whole, and Applicant's denial of any intent to engage in the disqualifying conduct did not preclude the Judge from weighing 
the record evidence and making findings that contradicted Applicant's denials.</P> 
 
<P>The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the 
particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance 
decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or 
<EM>vice versa</EM>.  An applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not 
sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible 
application of relevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors. The Judge found in Applicant's favor under Guideline M and paragraph 2.b of 
Guideline E.  However, the Judge articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying any mitigating conditions or whole person factors with respect to the 
other Guideline E allegation, and reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the 
government's security concerns.  Given the record that was before him, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline E is not arbitrary, 
capricious or contrary to law.</P>
