<P>Applicant's recreational abuse of marijuana in the mid 1980s and between October 1994 and March 2001 was mitigated where Applicant had stopped using

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 11 February 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-21285.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 5

and on 9 April 2002 issued a notice of hearing for 25 April 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, the Government presented three exhibits--admitted without objection--and no witnesses;  Applicant presented no exhibits, and the testimony

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR; accordingly, I incorporate the admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 33-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He has six years prior enlisted service in the U.S. military.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 7 December 2000--in anticipation of a June 2001 start date with his new employer--Applicant truthfully disclosed his drug abuse history on a Security 
Clearance Application (SCA)(SF 86)(G.E. 1).<A HREF="01-21285.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> In a sworn statement on 23 March 2001 (G.E. 2), Applicant described his drug abuse history:</SPAN></P> 
<P>I first used marijuana when I was in high school in 1986 or 1987. My use at that time was experimental and I would smoke marijuana once a month at parties 
until September1988. I joined the military in October 1988 and was discharged in October 1994. During my time in the military I never smoked marijuana or 
used any other illegal drugs. I have used marijuana approximately 26 times in the past seven years. The first time I used marijuana in the past seven years was in 
October 1994, with temporary housemates when I first moved to [city, state]. During my two years in [state], I used marijuana approximately eight times. My 
motivation for using marijuana was a demonstration of independence on my part after having so many restrictions placed on me during my time in the military. 
Since moving from [state], I  have used marijuana on average approximately two times per year while visiting friends in [city, state]. I listed my last use of 
marijuana as January 2000 on my personnel security questionnaire, which I completed in December 2000. Since the completion of  my personnel security 
questionnaire, I have used marijuana on four occasions. Once in January 2001 while on academic break from [university] and visiting friends in [city, state]. I 
also used marijuana on three occasions in March of 2001 while on vacation in [foreign country] where marijuana use is legal. I have never used any illegal 
controlled substance other than marijuana. I have never used any illegal controlled substance while employed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or 
courtroom official; while possessing a security clearance; or while in a position directly and immediately affecting the public safety. I have never bought, nor 
sold an illegal controlled substance for the purposes of profit or otherwise with the exception of the marijuana I used while in [foreign country]. I purchased a 
small quantity while in [foreign country] for approximately $8.00. During every other occurrence of marijuana use, friends or acquaintances in a social 
atmosphere supplied the marijuana for free. I have never cultivated, processed or manufactured any illegal controlled substances and have never been arrested 
or detained by law enforcement official for illegal drug use or possession. As I had done during my six years in the [military], I fully expect to honor my 
responsibilities and obligations to [employer] by not using marijuana or any other illegal controlled substance while employed with them.</P> 
<P> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR admitted the allegations, and provided additional information corroborating his excellent academic performance between Fall 
1997 and Spring 2001--during which period he was awarded undergraduate and graduate degrees in mathematics. Further, he stated that he had passed multiple 
random drug screening while in the military, and had purchased marijuana only while overseas in a country where he believed such purchases to be legal. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Applicant testified consistently and credibly with his sworn statement and answer. Pressed by Department Counsel on the point that his 
commitment to refrain from drug use seemed conditioned on his being in a cleared status, Applicant conceded that he might have felt that way in the past, but 
that the pain and embarrassment of the clearance process to both himself and his family made him realize that he needed to refrain from drug use, regardless of 
his clearance status (Tr. 36).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's co-worker and supervisor--a retired military officer with 20 years experience in counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism--considered Applicant 
a good security risk who now recognized the importance of a drug-free life-style. Applicant has been married two years. He took and passed a pre-employment 
drug screen in May 2001.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline H, but I consider the conduct mitigated. Applicant was a recreational abuser of marijuana from 1986 
to 1988, and again from 1994 to March 2001--conduct inconsistent with the holding of a clearance. Clearly, the illegality of the conduct (at those times the 
conduct was illegal) did not affect Applicant's decision to use marijuana. However, Applicant has clearly understood the importance of a drug-free lifestyle to a 
security clearance determination, and remained drug-free while in the military (and subject to drug screening) and since being employed by the contractor in 
June 2001. Department Counsel argues the risk that Applicant might return to marijuana use if not in a cleared status, and Applicant conceded that he might 
have considered that at one time, but not now--given his experience with the clearance process.<A HREF="01-21285.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant has stated an unequivocal intent to refrain from 
drug abuse in the future, without regard to his clearance status, and recognizes that the risks to his future and his family's future far outweigh any imagined 
benefit of resumed drug use. Department Counsel's argument to the contrary, while not unreasonable, does require some speculation about what Applicant 
might do in the future while not in a cleared status. I conclude it unlikely that Applicant will return to marijuana use in the future. That this motivation is more 
rooted in Applicant's unwillingness to put himself and his family through the clearance process ordeal he has been through than a fear of criminal consequences 
does not render the motivation invalid or insufficient to support the mitigating factor. Accordingly, I find Guideline H. for Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline H, but I consider the conduct mitigated. Applicant was a recreational abuser of marijuana from 1986 
to 1988, and again from 1994 to March 2001--conduct inconsistent with the holding of a clearance. Clearly, the illegality of the conduct (at those times the 
conduct was illegal) did not affect Applicant's decision to use marijuana. However, Applicant has clearly understood the importance of a drug-free lifestyle to a 
security clearance determination, and remained drug-free while in the military (and subject to drug screening) and since being employed by the contractor in 
June 2001. Department Counsel argues the risk that Applicant might return to marijuana use if not in a cleared status, and Applicant conceded that he might 
have considered that at one time, but not now--given his experience with the clearance process.<A HREF="01-21285.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Applicant has stated an unequivocal intent to refrain from 
drug abuse in the future, without regard to his clearance status, and recognizes that the risks to his future and his family's future far outweigh any imagined 
benefit of resumed drug use. Department Counsel's argument to the contrary, while not unreasonable, does require some speculation about what Applicant 
might do in the future while not in a cleared status. I conclude it unlikely that Applicant will return to marijuana use in the future. That this motivation is more 
rooted in Applicant's unwillingness to put himself and his family through the clearance process ordeal he has been through than a fear of criminal consequences 
does not render the motivation invalid or insufficient to support the mitigating factor. Accordingly, I find Guideline H. for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
