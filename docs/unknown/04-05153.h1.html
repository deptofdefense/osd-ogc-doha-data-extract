<P>Applicant began to experience financial difficulties because her husband was laid off from his job and she was unable to control her credit card spending.

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 31 January 2005, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="04-05153.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 21 March 2005 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. 
The case was assigned to me on 21 July 2005. I scheduled a hearing for 27 September 2005, but had to postpone it due to Hurricane Rita. On 1 November 2005, 
I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA 
received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 16 November 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 41-year-old lead position supply chain associate for a defense contractor. She had two children with her first husband, whom she divorced in 
1993. One child lives with her. She married again in 1997 and her husband's son resides with them. Applicant's supervisor raves about her work performance, 
reliability, and high ethical values. He noted her recent promotion because of her outstanding job performance.</P> 
<P>After her divorce, Applicant struggled financially. Applicant's current husband was an aircraft mechanic who worked on a contract basis. In September 2001, 
he was laid off. He received unemployment compensation and attended a technical school. He received $300 a week in unemployment compensation as 
compared to the $1,300-$1500 he formerly brought home each week. Tr. 14. He started work again in September 2003. A month later, he fractured some bones 
in his hand and injured his wrist. He received unemployment compensation of more than $2,148 a month from November 2003 until March 2005, when he 
returned to work. When her husband was injured, Applicant was working at a convenience store and attending school in physical therapy. Since she started with 
her present employer, she has progressed from making $8.50 an hour to $13 an hour. </P> 
<P>In September 2005, six months after returning to work, Applicant's husband injured his back. He started work again the last week in October, but had back 
spasms and had to leave. He expects to resume work in less than two weeks. </P> 
<P>Applicant admits she was seduced by the lure of credit cards and let her use of them get out of hand. She and her husband bought what they wanted instead of 
just what they needed or could afford. With her husband out of work, she made a conscious decision to focus on the needs of the family-paying the mortgage 
and putting food on the table-and did not make payments on many of the other debts she had accumulated. Although Applicant's husband's health problems 
have restricted the couple's income, when he works, the couple earns at a rate of over $100,000 a year. Exs. C, E.</P>

<P>On 9 January 2003, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) that was submitted electronically on 29 January 2003. Applicant certified her 
answers were "true, complete, and correct" to the best of her knowledge and belief and acknowledged that "a knowing and willful false statement" could be 
punished by fine and/or imprisonment. Question 38 asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had been delinquent more than 180 days on any debt. 
Applicant answered "yes," and listed one $150 debt to a department store. Question 39 asked if she was currently delinquent more than 90 days on any debts. 
Applicant answered "no."</P>

Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence established potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline F</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant has a history of not meeting financial obligations 
(DC E2.A6.1.2.1) and is unable or unwilling to satisfy her debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3). Applicant made a good-faith effort to pay some of these delinquent debts 
(MC E2.A6.1.3.6), but only the smaller ones. She still has delinquent debts totaling more than $38,000 for which she has made no plans to pay. Some of her 
financial problems are no doubt due to conditions beyond her control (MC E2.A6.1.3.3)-her husband was laid off, was unable to find employment for two years 
and received only unemployment insurance, and was injured shortly after starting a job in 2003, putting him on workmen's compensation for two years. But 
during the time he was out of work due to injuries, he received 80 percent of his monthly wages. It is clear that, although these factors contributed, Applicant's 
financial problems are in large measure due to the couple misusing their credit cards. Under all the circumstances, Applicant's financial condition leaves her at 
risk. I find against Applicant on the allegations in &para;&para; 1.a, 1.b, 1.f-1.h, 1.j-1.m, 1.p, 1.q, 1.v, and 1.w. I found for her on the debts she paid or is paying under a 
payment plan.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant deliberately omitted some of the debts from the answers she gave to question 38 (&para; 2.a) and 39 (&para; 2.b) of the SCA. 
Applicant denied both allegations. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations could indicate the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant asserts she only listed one debt in answer to question 38 because it was the only debt for which she had all of the information required (such as the 
credit account number), and her security officer told her that it would be sufficient if she listed only that debt.  But she suggests otherwise in the statement she 
gave to a Defense Security Service agent on 18 February 2004. Ex. 3. In it, she claims she did not list all of her debts because "they were old debts and either 
charged off and or sent to collection. I guess I misunderstood the question about finances on my security." Under all the circumstances, I conclude Applicant 
deliberately omitted the information requested in questions 38 and 39 of her SCA.</SPAN></P>
