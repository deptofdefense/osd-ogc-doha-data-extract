<P>Although his family ties to Australia raise a security concern, Applicant has successfully mitigated the concern because of the steps he has taken.  Additionally, 
the totality of the facts and circumstances under the "whole person" concept further show his family ties do not pose an unacceptable risk of foreign preference

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On October 9, 2006, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reason (SOR)<A HREF="06-09757.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C (Foreign 
Preference) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on October 30, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on November 8, 2006.  On November 29, 2006, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing for December 21, 2006.  
The hearing was conducted as scheduled. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government offered five documents, which were admitted without objections as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5.  The Applicant offered eight 
documents, which were admitted without objections as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through H.  I held the record open to afford Applicant additional time to 
submit material in support of his case.  Applicant submitted one additional material document, which was admitted as AE I, without objections.  DOHA 
received the transcript on January 3, 2007.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concerning the security guidelines, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified 
Information approved by the President on December 29, 2005.  The revised guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective September 1, 
2006.  They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive and Appendix 8 to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R.  They apply to all 
adjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter, and they apply to this case because the SOR is 
dated October 9, 2006.  Both the Directive and the Regulation are pending formal amendment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon review of the record and new Adjudicative Guidelines, I reopened the record on February 21, 2007 to afford Applicant further opportunity to submit 
additional material in support of his case.  Applicant submitted additional material, which was marked as AE J and K, without objections. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his Answer, Applicant admitted, with explanation all the SOR allegations (SOR &para;&para; 1., 1.a. through 1.c., 2., 2.a., and 3., 3.a.).  His admissions are 
incorporated into my findings.  After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified during the hearing, and I find his testimony credible.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 47-year-old senior scientist who has been employed by a defense contractor since April 2000.  He is a first-time applicant for a security 
clearance.  He has been married to his U.S. born wife since January 2005.  (Applicant's wife holds a Ph.D. in psychology and is employed as a technical 
manager at a major university where she manages their netware corporations.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant has no children, he is the biological father to a one-year-old daughter born to his wife's sister through artificial insemination.  He openly 
acknowledges he is the biological father to this child.  Although he does not provide financial support to this child, he is involved in her upbringing.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born, raised, and educated in Australia.  He attended university in Australia and was awarded a bachelor of science degree, majoring in physics, 
in December 1980.  Following his degree, he began a one-year honors program under the Australian educational system.  Applicant stated under the Australian 
system "there was no need for a masters's degree."  From January 1981 to July 1993, he was in a Ph.D. program offered through an Australian university.  
From 1990 to 1993, he worked on his doctoral dissertation and was awarded his Ph.D. in physics in November 1993.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant arrived in the U.S. in March 1990 on a J-1 visa, which he later converted to an H-1 visa.  He met his wife in 1993, and began seeing her "regularly" 
in 1994.  He received his "green card" in approximately 1997, and became a U.S. citizen and received his U.S. passport in May 2004.  Applicant is a dual 
citizen of Australia and also holds an Australian passport (SOR &para; 1.a.).  His Australian passport was issued on August 28, 1999, and will expire on August 28, 
2009 (SOR &para; 1.b.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's relatives in Australia include his mother (SOR &para; 2.a.), his sister-in-law, who was married to his late brother, a cousin, and nephew (SOR &para; 3.).  
Applicant used his Australian passport when visiting Australia in May 2005 (SOR &para; 1.c.).  He traveled to Australia in March 1996, March 1999, October 2001, 
December 2002, October 2003, March 2004, and May 2005 (SOR &para; 3.a.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before Applicant's father died, he had "a number of professions" to include auto mechanic, self-taught electrical engineer, "welding jobs and other stuff like 
that," and later on in life was a beekeeper behaviorist.  Tr. 76.  Afer Applicant's mother married his father, she became and remained a housewife.  Applicant's 
late brother met his wife (Applicant's sister-in-law) at a U.S. facility located in Australia.  After Applicant's brother married Applicant's sister-in-law, she 
became and remained a housewife.  Applicant's cousin is a "jack of all trades" who worked as a biologist for an Australian government and had "various odd 
jobs" after he retired such as growing flowers for gardens.  Tr. 78-79.  Applicant's nephew recently graduated from high school and has yet to establish a 
career.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 23, 2007, Applicant surrendered his Australian passport to his Facility Security Officer (FSO).  The FSO verified that Applicant had surrendered 
his passport to him.  The FSO further stated if Applicant requested his Australian passport be returned to him, he would document the facts and circumstances 
surrounding the return by an entry in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother is 85-years-old, a widow, and lives by herself.  Applicant has investigated the option of moving her to the U.S., however, he has 
encountered difficulty in obtaining affordable health care insurance for her.  To date, he has not discovered any viable health care coverage and, given her age, 
he does not want to risk bringing her to the U.S. without adequate coverage.  Applicant maintains his Australian citizenship and Australian passport solely to 
retain the flexibility of being able to travel to Australia as long as necessary on short notice to assist his mother should she develop a medical emergency.  He is 
his mother's only living child.  Applicant remains in contact with his mother by telephone and calls her every one-to-two weeks.  Applicant contacts his sister-in-law by telephone several times a year, and sends her flowers on her birthday and when he visits Australia.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has no property or assets in Australia.  He does expect to inherit 50% of his mother's estate when she passes on and estimates his portion to 
approximate slightly more than $100,000.00.  Conversely, Applicant has substantial assets in the U.S.  Applicant and his wife each earn approximately 
$114,000.00 gross income per year, for a joint gross income totaling $228,000.00 per year.  They purchased their home in 2000 for approximately 
$330,000.00 and have paid down their mortgage to $250,000.00.  Their home is currently valued at approximately $650,000.00.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's other assets include $184,000.00 in a 401(K) retirement plan, company stocks worth $113,000.00, $20,000.00 in other stocks, and $60,000.00 in 
bank accounts and cash due from a one-time payment of company stocks.  He estimates his joint net worth at $1,027,000.00, which includes all assets, or his 
singly held assets at $702,000.00.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified his life is "clearly here in the U.S.  I lost my brother (in Australia) about three years ago.  My father [has] passed away.  My mother is at an 
advanced age.  Hopefully she'll have another ten years.  But I'm in close contact with my wife's family (U.S. citizens).  She has a fairly large family.  My career 
is here.  And I have a daughter here as well who I could not take to Australia here."  Tr. 57.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant stated in his response to interrogatories, "As part of my naturalization to US citizenship I swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States and 
to defend the US against all enemies both domestic and foreign.  I wholeheartedly gave that oath and stand by it.  Should I feel that I have a moral conflict in 
any work I would ask to recused from that work.  I would maintain that work as classified and secret, as required by law."  GE 2.  Applicant is registered and 
regularly votes in U.S. elections, and exercises all rights of a U.S. citizen.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided two work-related reference letters from officials describing his work performance as outstanding.  The letters emphasized he is a 
conscientious and trustworthy employee.  These letters document in detail the tremendous contributions Applicant has made to the national defense over the 
years and his potential for future service.  They also make it clear Applicant is a trusted and valued employee.  AE  B through C.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government offered exhibits, as did the Applicant, from the U.S. Department of State, relevant to U.S. - Australia relations.  A pertinent portion taken 
from Background Note: Australia, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, August 2006, states in part:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>U.S. - AUSTRALIAN RELATIONS - </STRONG>The World War II experience, similarities in culture and historical background, and shared democratic values have 
made U.S. relations with Australia exceptionally strong and close.  Ties linking the two nations cover the entire spectrum of international relations - from 
commercial, cultural, and  environmental contacts to political and defense cooperation.  Two-way trade reached $30.1 billion in 2004.  More than 400,000 
Americans have visited Australia in a single year.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Traditional friendship is reinforced by the wide range of common interests and similar views on most major international questions.  For example, both 
countries sent military forces to the Persian Gulf in support of UN Security Council resolutions relating to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait; both attach high 
priority to controlling and eventually eliminating chemical weapons, other weapons of mass destruction, and anti-personnel landmines; and both work closely 
on global environmental issues such as slowing climate change and preserving coral reefs.  The Australian Government and opposition share the view that 
Australia's security depends on firm ties with the Unites States, and the ANZUS Treaty enjoys broad bipartisan support.  Recent Presidential visits to Australia 
(in 1991, 1996 and 2003) and Australian Prime Ministerial visits to the United States (in 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006) have 
underscored the strength and closeness of the alliance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The bilateral Australia - U.S. Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA) entered into force on January 1, 2005.  This comprehensive agreement, only the second FTA 
the U.S. had negotiated with a developed nation, substantially liberalizes an already vibrant trade and investment relationship.  The AUSFTA also creates a 
range of ongoing working groups and committees designed to explore further trade reform in the bilateral context.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Both countries share a commitment to liberalizing global trade.  They work together very closely in the World Trade Organization (WTO), and both are active 
members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A number of U.S. institutions conduct scientific activities in Australia because of its geographical position, large and mass, advanced technology, and, above 
all, the ready cooperation of its government and scientists.  Under an agreement dating back to 1960 and since renewed, the U.S. National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA) maintains in Australia once of its largest and most important program outside the United States, including a number of tracking 
facilities vital to the U.S. space program.  Indicative of the broadranging U.S. - Australian cooperation on other global issues, a Mutual Legal Assistance 
Treaty (MLAT) was conducted in 1997, enhancing already close bilateral cooperation on legal and counter-narcotics issues.  In 2001, the U.S. and Australia 
signed a new tax treaty and a bilateral social security agreement.<A HREF="06-09757.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In an evaluation of an applicant's security suitability, an administrative judge must consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative 
guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into disqualifying conditions (DC) and 
mitigating conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should 
apply these guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive.  An 
administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a 
number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive &para; E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to the relevant 
adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN>  Since the protection of the national security is the paramount 
consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence."<A HREF="06-09757.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to 
establish a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the 
burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.  Directive &para; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E3.1.15 provides, "The applicant is responsible </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">for presenting 
witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the government.  
<EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).</SPAN><A HREF="06-09757.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be 
able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>The scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of 
Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, 
loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied 
determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline C - Foreign Preference</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline C, a security concern may exist when an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, 
then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  Directive &para; 9.</P> 
 
<P>Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) 10.(a) <EM>exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen 
or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to (1) possession of a current foreign passport.</EM></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Australia, and has exercised his Australian citizenship by obtaining and using an Australian passport to enter 
Australia after he became a U.S. citizen.  He maintains an Australian passport for the sole purpose of having the flexibility of being able to care for his elderly 
mother in Australia.  Such flexibility would include being able to travel to Australia on short notice and stay for an extended period of time, if required.  
Applicant is his mother's sole surviving child.  Applicant's past visits to Australia were primarily to visit his mother and secondarily to visit his sister-in-law, 
cousin, and nephew.  </P> 
 
<P>This case poses a new challenge and a case of first impression in the application of the Revised Guidelines.<A HREF="06-09757.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  A significant concern surrounding the possession 
of a foreign passport is the ability of the holder to travel to and from a foreign country under the sponsorship of the government issuing the passport and 
oftentimes without the knowledge of the U.S. Government.  Conversely, traveling to a foreign country with a U.S. passport precludes that from occurring.  
Using a foreign passport in lieu of a U.S. passport may also show a preference of the rights and privileges afforded by that foreign country over the U.S. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's Australian citizenship is derived solely by his birth in Australia to Australian parents.  The evidence clearly supports the notion the Applicant is a 
loyal and devoted U.S. citizen.  To accommodate the Revised Guidelines, Applicant has surrendered his Australian passport to his FSO, and his FSO has stated 
any request by the Applicant seeking return of his Australian passport would be documented by a JPAS entry explaining such action.  </P> 
 
<P>By Applicant surrendering his Australian passport to his FSO, he forfeits the flexibility of unfettered and undocumented travel.  Furthermore, any attempt by 
Applicant to retrieve his Australian passport will be documented by a JPAS entry and the U.S. Government will have knowledge of such action.  These 
collective facts warrant application of Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions (FP MC) 11.a.: <EM>dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth 
in a foreign country; </EM>and FP MC 11.e.: <EM>the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.  </EM>It is my 
"commonsense" determination that Applicant's FSO qualifies under the Revised Guidelines as cognizant security authority.  Applicant no longer retains the 
unfettered ability to use his Australian passport and has taken steps to comply with the Revised Guidelines.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Under Guideline B, </SPAN>foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be 
manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or 
coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or 
financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain 
protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.  Directive &para; 6.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline B for foreign influence, a security clearance risk exists when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to 
whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, <EM>are not</EM> citizens of the United States <EM>or may </EM>be subject to duress.  These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial 
interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  
Common sense suggests that the stronger the ties of affection or obligation, the more vulnerable a person is to being manipulated if the relative, cohibitant, or 
close associate is brought under control or used as a hostage by a foreign intelligence or security service.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The concern under Guideline B is the presence of Applicant's family members to include his mother, sister-in-law, cousin, and nephew who are resident citizens 
of Australia.  Applicant's travel to Australia to visit his mother primarily and his sister-in-law, cousin, and nephew secondarily have the potential to make 
Applicant vulnerable to foreign influence.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Disqualifying condition  applicable under Guideline B based on these facts is:  &para; 7.(a) <EM>contact with a foreign family member, business or professional 
associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, 
inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.</EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All of Applicant's adult family members in Australia are either retired or not in the work force.  His late brother and sister-in-law were employed at a U.S. 
facility in Australia.  His nephew, who just graduated from high school, has not joined the work force.  The likelihood of any of these individuals being placed 
in a position to extract information from Applicant directly or indirectly is remote.  This is made more evident given this Applicant is in a country governed by 
the rule of law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has spent the past 17 years in the U.S., has married a U.S. born wife, and has become integrated in the U.S.  His joint assets in the U.S. exceed $1 
million in contrast to the $100,000.00 worth of assets in Australia he stands to inherit when his mother passes away.  It is apparent from his demeanor and 
actions taken the U.S. is his home.  Furthermore, Australia, his country of origin, is on excellent terms with the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating conditions applicable under Guideline B are: 8.(a) <EM>the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons is 
located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose 
between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; </EM>and 8.(b) <EM>there is no conflict of interest, either 
because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep

<P>In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions discussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the 
whole person concept under Directive <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">&para; E2.2.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that a Judge may find in favor of an applicant where no specific 
mitigating conditions apply.<A HREF="06-09757.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Moreover, "[u]nder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant's 
life separately, in a piecemeal manner.  Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant's security eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant's conduct 
and circumstances."<A HREF="06-09757.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are used for "whole person" analysis.  Because foreign influence does 
not involve misconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth APF, </SPAN>"the potential for pressure, coercion, 
exploitation, or duress," Directive <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">&para; E2.2.1.8,</SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.<A HREF="06-09757.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In addition to the eighth APF, other "[a]vailable, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Directive &para; E2.2.1.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN>The Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address "evidence of an applicant's personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant's family's ties 
to the U.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case." ISCR 
Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).  In that same decision, the Appeal Board commended the whole person analysis in ISCR Case No. 03-02878 
at 3 (App. Bd. June 7, 2006), which provides:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has been in the U.S. for twenty years and a naturalized citizen for seven.  Her husband is also a naturalized citizen, and her children are U.S. citizens 
by birth.  Her ties to these family members are stronger than her ties to family members in Taiwan.  She has significant financial interests in the U.S. , and none 
in Taiwan.  She testified credibly that she takes her loyalty to the U.S. very seriously and would defend the interests of the U.S.  Her supervisors and co-worker 
assess her as very loyal and trustworthy.  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There are many other countervailing, positive attributes to Applicant's life as a U.S. citizen that weigh towards granting his clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He has strong links or 
connections to the United States: (1) Applicant became a U.S. citizen in May 2004 and immediately applied for a U.S. passport; (2) His wife and her family are 
U.S. citizens, and all of them reside in the United States.  (3) His biological daughter is a U.S. born citizen; (4) Applicant has resided in the U.S. for the past 17 
years and has not been to Australia except for brief visits primarily to check on his mother's welfare, (5) Applicant holds a responsible position as a research 
scientist with a defense contractor; (6) His wife also holds a responsible position as a technical manager at a major university; (7) All his real and personal 
property are in the U.S. to include owning a home; (8) All his substantial financial connections are in the United States;<A HREF="06-09757.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN> and (9) He credibly stated that he 
would never do anything to harm the U.S.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN>There is no reason to believe that he would take any action that could cause potential harm to his U.S. family or to this country.  He<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is patriotic, loves the 
United States, and would not permit Australia to exploit him.  He has close ties to the United States.  </SPAN>The realistic <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">possibility of pressure, coercion, exploitation 
or duress is low.  I base this conclusion on his credible and sincere testimony, and I do not believe he would compromise national security, or otherwise comply 
with any Australian threats or coercion.  Applicant has not been to Australia since 2005</SPAN>.  His supervisors, coworkers and friends describe him as very honest, 
loyal, and trustworthy.  He is involved in his local community and is an asset to his community and company.  </P>

</SPAN>mitigated or overcome the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence and foreign preference. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I have no doubts concerning Applicant's security eligibility 
and suitability.  I take this position based on the law, as set forth in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan,</EM> 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my "careful consideration of the whole
