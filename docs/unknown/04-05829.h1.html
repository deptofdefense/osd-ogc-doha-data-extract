<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 29 October 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="04-05829.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 19 November 2004 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative 
judge. The case was assigned to me on 27 April 2005. On 25 May 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 6 June 2005.</P> 
<P>At the request of Applicant, I kept the record open until 10 June 2005. Applicant submitted a statement summarizing his position on the allegations against him 
and two exhibits. Department Counsel objected to the additional argument, but had no objection to the exhibits. Applicant's Exs. Y and Z were admitted into 
evidence. I also considered Applicant's statement.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 37-year-old senior network analyst for a defense contractor. Applicant served in the U.S. Navy for several months in 1996 and was granted an 
entry level separation. His wife recently suffered a heart attack. Applicant's customers and supervisor find him to be a dedicated professional.</P>

<P>Applicant completed a personal financial statement in December 2003 that showed he had over $1,000 a month remaining after he paid his monthly expenses. 
Ex. 2 at 4.</P> 
<P>While Applicant was overseas, the owner of the house Applicant and his family were renting sold it, and Applicant's wife had to find another place to live. She 
moved to a local hotel and became involved in several disputes with the management. In an undated letter to management (apparently sent in 1998), Applicant 
protested his wife's treatment. He stated, "Just the fact that someone entered the room without notice when there is approximately $10k worth of computer 
equipment and government classified material in there is cause enough for the authorities to get involved . . . ." Ex. 9 at 2. In a statement given to a Defense 
Security Service agent, Applicant claimed the material was only FOUO. Ex. 4 at 1. At the hearing, Applicant presented examples of the documents he had at his 
wife's dwelling. They are neither classified nor FOUO. Applicant claims he thought they were FOUO at the time he made the statement. <EM>See</EM> Tr. 64-65.</P>

authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was arrested for issuing a bad check in 1990 (&para; 1.a), has three unsatisfied judgments totaling more than $13,000 (&para;&para; 1.b, 
1.g, and 1.h), had three delinquent debts totaling more than $3,800 placed for collection (&para;&para; 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f), and was delinquent in paying the more than 
$10,000 balance on a vehicle that was repossessed (&para; 1.e). Applicant denied all allegations, except those in &para;&para; 1.e and 1.g. Answer. An applicant who is 
financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government failed to establish Applicant was arrested for issuing a bad check. I find for Applicant on &para; 1.a.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has two judgments that have not been paid, totaling more than $3,000 (&para;&para; 1.b, 1.h) and another judgment for which he has no proof he paid (&para; 1.d); he 
has a charged-off debt of more than $10,000 for the balance on a repossessed motor vehicle (&para; 1.e); and he has a delinquent debt that went to collection for 
more than $1,300 (&para; 1.f). The Government established </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1.) and is unable or 
unwilling to satisfy his debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3.).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the debts were not recently incurred (MC E2.A6.1.3.1), Applicant has done little to resolve them and 
more than $10,000 in delinquent debt remains outstanding. His failure to pay these debts in a timely manner, especially when he appears to be in fairly good 
financial condition, demonstrates his cavalier attitude towards his debts. Even the debt he paid (&para; 1.c), a 1997 debt for $248, was not paid until after the hearing 
was scheduled. None of the other mitigating conditions apply. I find against Applicant on &para;&para; 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h. As the most recent evidence shows 
Applicant appealed de novo the default judgment alleged in &para; 1.g, I find for him.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant left For Official Use Only (FOUO) materials in the hotel room where his wife was residing while he was performing 
temporary duty at another location (&para; 2.a). Applicant denied the allegation. Answer. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, 
lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate the applicant may not properly safeguard classified 
information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions establish potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The evidence Applicant had FOUO 
materials in his wife's hotel room-is sketchy at best. It is based on a statement Applicant made. After reviewing the statement, I am not convinced Applicant 
had FOUO materials in the room. Although not alleged, Applicant's claim, in a letter to an uncleared person, that he had left classified information in his wife's 
hotel room is of some concern. Such action certainly demonstrates his questionable judgment. Nevertheless, as the SOR does not put him on clear notice of this 
issue, I find for Applicant on &para; 2.a.</SPAN></P>
