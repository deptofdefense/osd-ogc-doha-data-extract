<P>Administrative Judge Barry M. Sax issued a decision, dated August 5, 1998 in which he concluded it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed. For the
reasons set forth below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P>

<P>Applicant raises three issues on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's findings of fact were supported by substantial
record evidence, whether the Administrative Judge properly applied the Directive, and whether the Administrative Judge's
decision was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law?</P>

<P><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant on March 31, 1998.  The
SOR was based on Criterion G (Alcohol Consumption) and Criterion E (Personal Conduct).  A hearing was conducted on
June 23, 1998.  The Administrative Judge issued a written decision on August 5, 1998 in which he concluded it was not
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the
Board on appeal from that unfavorable decision.</P>

<P><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></P>

<P>1.<U> Whether the Administrative Judge's findings of fact were supported by substantial record evidence?</U>  Applicant
challenges the Administrative Judge's findings from seven passages in the Judge's decision.  The board will analyze each
challenge separately.</P>

<P>Applicant alleges that the Judge erred when he wrote that Applicant "used alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of
intoxication, from approximately 1982 to the present, with occasional periods of abstinence."  There is substantial record
evidence in the form of documentary evidence and Applicant's testimony supporting those findings.  Applicant gave
inconsistent statements about his alcohol consumption.  The Administrative Judge made plausible findings of fact based
on credible record evidence.  Applicant has not demonstrated judicial error by virtue of pointing out that Applicant's own
testimony was at times inconsistent.</P>

<P>Applicant correctly notes that the Administrative Judge wrote 1998 in a place where the correct year was 1996.  There is
no indication that this error had any substantive impact on the Administrative Judge's decision, therefore, it is merely
harmless error that does not warrant remand or reversal.</P>

<P>Applicant also correctly notes that the Judge mis-described a university alcohol treatment program as being Navy
sponsored.  Again there is no basis to conclude that the Judge's error had a substantive impact on the ultimate outcome of
the case.  Therefore, this error also is harmless.</P>

<P>Applicant twice contests the Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant was arrested on October 25, 1997.  There is
ample record evidence supporting the Judge's finding.  Applicant himself wrote in his answer to the SOR, "I was arrested
with a group of individuals and I was never charged.  In fact, the policemen who arrested everyone, are under
investigation for their conduct."   Also Government Exhibit 5, the arrest report, describes Applicant's arrest.</P>

<P>Applicant contests the Administrative Judge's description of the Navy's decision to revoke Applicant's security clearance. 
A review of the language in the Navy's July 19, 1996 letter to Applicant is sufficiently consistent with the Administrative
Judge's description to support the conclusion there was no error.</P>

<P>Applicant contests the Administrative Judge's assertion that Applicant continued to abuse alcohol after a January 29, 1996
court order for Applicant to abstain from alcohol consumption for five years.  The Board concludes that there was
sufficient evidence concerning the October 25, 1997 arrest for the Administrative Judge to infer that Applicant abused
alcohol on that occasion.</P>

<P>2. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge properly applied the Directive?</U>  Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge
failed to apply Alcohol Consumption mitigating conditions to Applicant's conduct.  The Board is not persuaded that
harmful error has been demonstrated.</P>

<P>Given Applicant's overall history of alcohol abuse, it was not arbitrary and capricious for the Administrative Judge to not
apply Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions 1<A HREF="97-0825.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> and 2.<A HREF="97-0825.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  Furthermore, given the fact that Applicant abused alcohol
after an earlier period of abstinence and given the relative brevity of Applicant's abstinence from alcohol after the October
1997 incident, it was not arbitrary and capricious for the Judge to not apply Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition
4.<A HREF="97-0825.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>  The Judge erred by not applying Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition 3<A HREF="97-0825.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> or failing to explain his reason(s)
for not applying that mitigating condition.  A Judge must apply pertinent Adjudicative Guidelines.  Directive, Section F.3. 
If a provision of the Adjudicative Guideline appears to apply to the facts of a particular case, then the Judge is obligated to
apply that provision or give a rationale explanation for not doing so.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0803 (June 19, 1998) at
p. 2.  Here, Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition 3 appears to be supported by the record evidence, yet the Judge
did not apply it and did not give any explanation for not applying it.  Accordingly, the Judge erred.</P>

<P>However, the Administrative Judge's error with respect to Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition 3 does not warrant
remand or reversal.  The presence or absence of a factor for or against clearance is not solely dispositive of a case.  Rather,
applicable factors must be considered in light of the record evidence as a whole. <EM> See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0765
(December 1, 1998) at p. 6; ISCR Case No. 98-0111 (November 13, 1998) at p. 4.   Therefore, even if the Board were to
conclude that the Judge should have applied Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition 3, it would not follow, as a
matter of law, that the Judge would have been obligated to make a favorable security clearance decision.  Considering the
record evidence as a whole, the Board concludes that there is not a significant chance that but for the Judge's error
concerning Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition 3 the outcome would have been different.  Accordingly, the
Judge's error is harmless.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0765 (December 1, 1998) at p. 6; ISCR Case No. 97-0707
(September 1, 1998) at p. 3.</P>

<P>3. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge's decision was arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law?</U>  Applicant contends that the
Administrative Judge relied on the Navy's 1996 adverse security clearance decision.  In fact the Administrative Judge did
ample analysis of his own including considering Applicant's conduct since the Navy's decision.  Applicant again raises his
disagreement with the Judge's findings on the October 1997 arrest.  As noted earlier, the Administrative Judge had
sufficient record evidence on which to base his findings as to the October 1997 arrest.  Applicant has not demonstrated
that the Administrative Judge's decision was arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</P>

<P><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></P>

<P>Applicant has failed to demonstrate harmful error below.  Therefore the Administrative Judge's decision is affirmed.</P>
