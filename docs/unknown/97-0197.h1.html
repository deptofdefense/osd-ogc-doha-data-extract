  Applicant held dual citizenship because of his birth in the U.S. to an American father and a mother who was a citizen of Country X.

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>On March 18, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>," dated February 20,
1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 <EM>"Defense Industrial</EM>
<EM>Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>" (Directive) dated January 2, 1992, as amended by
Change 3, dated February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary determination that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 24, 1997, and requested a hearing
before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on May
5, 1997.  On May 29, 1997, a hearing was convened for the purpose of considering whether it was
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant's security clearance.  The Government's
case consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on his own testimony, the testimony of his wife and 
five exhibits.  A transcript of the proceedings was received on June 9, 1997.</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</U></STRONG>The SOR alleges that Applicant holds and has traveled with the passport of Country X
(subparagraph 1.a.), that he has registered for the military service of that Country (subparagraph
1.b.), that he had voted in a local election <STRONG>in </STRONG>that Country between 1994 and 1996 (subparagraph
1.c.), that he intends to vote in future elections of that Country (subparagraph 1.d.), and the SOR
further alleges that Applicant's spouse is employed locally by the Navy of Country X (subparagraph
1.e.).</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>Applicant admitted, with explanation, the factual allegations set forth in subparagraphs 1.a.,
1.b., and 1.e. of the SOR, and denied, with explanation, the factual allegations set forth in
subparagraphs 1.c. and 1.d.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and
upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant is 38 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor since May 1994. 
 Previously he has worked directly for the ------------------------, and as a contract employee for the
--------------------------, the --------------------, and the ------------------.  He has not held a security
clearance and is currently applying for a clearance at the secret level.  A favorable preliminary
determination could not be made on Applicant's suitability for a security clearance because his
connections with Country X suggest that he may prefer a foreign country over the United States.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U></STRONG></U><FONT FACE="Times">	In his answer to the SOR and during the administrative hearing, Applicant admitted that he
is a citizen of, and holds a passport of Country X.  He explained that he has dual citizenship because
he was born in the United States to a mother who was a citizen and an employee of Country X, and
a father who was an American citizen.  He has used the passport of Country X to enter and leave that
Country--as required by law, and he has used his American Passport for all other travel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant admits that he registered for military service in Country X.  He explains that he
was living in Country X when he turned 18--an age when all male citizens (of that country) are
required by law to present themselves for military service.  If he had not registered, Applicant would
have risked imprisonment; he would have been unable to continue his studies at the university; and
he would have been unable to obtain the identification card which is a prerequisite for holding a job
or obtaining a driver's licence.  Applicant did not subsequently serve in the armed forces of Country
X.<A HREF="97-0197.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> Attachment C to Department Counsel's Pre-hearing Memorandum of Law, and the certified
translated documents submitted by Applicant, affirm that registering for military service is a legal
requirement of Country X (Applicant's Exhibit D).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant denies that he voted in an election <STRONG>in </STRONG>Country X within the past three years.  He
admits that he  voted in a local election of Country X during that time period, but states that he voted
through that country's local embassy.  He last voted in an election<STRONG> in</STRONG> Country X in 1986.  Applicant
explains that he voted in that election because he is legally required to vote. Likewise with respect
to Applicant's future voting intentions, he states in answer to the SOR that "voting is not a question
of intention, it is a question of obligation."  He will vote in future elections of Country X, not
because he wants to, but because he is required to vote and is subject to penalties if he does not vote. 
Attachment C to Department Counsel's Pre-hearing Memorandum of Law, and the certified
translated documents submitted by Applicant affirm this legal requirement (Applicant's Exhibit D).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant admits that his wife is a citizen of Country X, and that she is employed by the ----
of that country.<A HREF="97-0197.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  He explained that his wife has had a Green Card--documenting her status as a
resident alien--which she obtained through his sponsorship.  She gave up her Green Card in order
to be able to sponsor a nanny for child care.  He went on to explain that he earns four times (roughly)
what his wife earns.  Applicant and his wife have two young children--ages two and three; they also
have dual citizenship.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant testified that his principal allegiance is to the United States; he was educated in
American primary and secondary schools;<A HREF="97-0197.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> he graduated from college in the United States and all
of his professional ties and employment have been in this country.  He has maintained dual
citizenship as a matter of convenience.  Dual citizenship makes it easier for him to travel from the
United States to Country X where he and wife have friends and relatives.  His wife is a native and
citizen of Country X, and he has relatives there because his mother is also a native of that country. 
He stated in answer to the SOR that he would renounce the citizenship of Country X if that course
of action was required; he reiterated his willingness to give up his citizenship in Country X--if it
became necessary--at his administrative hearing (Tr. 67, 73).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has excellent work references as documented by letters from those for whom he
has worked.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure. 
Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward
making determinations with reasonable consistency that are clearly consistent with the interests of
national security.  In making those overall common sense determinations, Administrative Judges
must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only
with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines but in the context of the factors set forth in
section F.3. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not only has the burden of proving
any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also demonstrate that the facts proven have a
nexus to an applicant's lack of security worthiness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The following Adjudicative Guidelines are deemed applicable to the instant matter.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><U>FOREIGN PREFERENCE</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER></U></STRONG>(Criterion C)</CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over
the United States, the he or she may be prone to provide information or make a decisions that are
harmful to the interests of the United  States.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	(1) The exercise of dual citizenship;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	(2) Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	(3) Military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	(8) Voting in foreign elections;</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	(1)	Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	(3)	Activity is sanctioned by the United States;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	(4)	Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><STRONG><U>Burden of Proof</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted facts alleged in the Statement
of Reasons.  If the Government establishes its case, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant
to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or extenuates the
disqualifying conduct and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
or continue his security clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the Government
raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy
burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands that Court's rationale, doubts are to be
resolved against an applicant.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Having considered the record evidence in accordance with the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard
to Criterion C. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the
factors enumerated in Section F.3, as well as those referred to in the section dealing with the
Adjudicative Process, both in the Directive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	With respect to Criterion C allegations, Applicant has admitted that he is a citizen of Country
X and holds a passport of that country.  He admits that he uses the  passport of Country X for travel 
into and out of that Country, and he admits that he registered for military service in Country X.  He
has also admitted that he voted in elections of that country in the past, and that he intends to satisfy
his legal obligation to vote in future elections of Country X.  And Applicant admits that his wife is
a citizen and employee of Country X.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant's significant connections with Country X raise a security concern because they
suggest that he may make decisions which would be harmful to the interests of the United States. 
However, these security concerns have been mitigated by his explanation of the circumstances under
which his connections with Country X were established and have been maintained.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant is a citizen of Country X because his mother was a citizen and an employee of that
country when he was born.  He has dual citizenship because he was born in the United States and
his father was/is an American citizen.  Although he has lived in Country X at different times in his
life, and has voted and registered for military service in order to fulfill the statutory requirements of
citizenship in Country X, he did not play an active role in acquiring the citizenship of that country..</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The security concerns raised by Applicant's established connections to Country X are further
dispelled by his testimony describing his more significant ties and allegiance to the United States. 
In addition to having been born in the United States, he has attended principally American Schools,
even while residing in Country X.  He received his college education in the United States and has
spent his entire professional life in this country--working directly for the U.S. Government, or
indirectly, through his work for private employers on government contracts.  Because of these
significant ties,  he was credible when he testified that his principal allegiance is to the United States. 
This Administrative Judge believes his assurance--made initially in response to the SOR, and more
recently during his administrative hearing--that he would forfeit his citizenship in Country X if it
became necessary. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant's current ties with Country X--maintaining a passport and voting in its
elections--appear to be the minimum requirements for avoiding penalties and maintaining his
citizenship in that country.  His justification for maintaining dual citizenship--i.e., that it makes
travel between the two countries easier--would be frivolous if dual citizenship violated United
States law. However, he is not violating the law.  Since Department Counsel has not proffered any
evidence that Applicant's recent actions to maintain his citizenship--holding a passport of Country
X and voting in Country X elections--are prohibited by U.S. law or regulation, this Administrative
Judge has concluded that these activities are sanctioned, at least implicitly.  Applicant's interest in
being able to travel to Country X with minimal inconvenience is understandable in view of the
friends and family that he and his wife have in that Country.  Accordingly, subparagraph 1.a. through
1.d. of Criterion C are concluded for Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	An additional disqualifying condition--improperly alleged under Criterion C in the SOR--is
the citizenship and employment of Applicant's wife; she is both a citizen of Country X and an
employee of that Country's ----.  While the foreign citizenship and employment of an applicant's
spouse (by a foreign government) are not identified as disqualifying under Criterion C (Foreign
Preference), they are identified as disqualifying conditions under Criterion B (Foreign Influence). 
Under the circumstances of this case, these conditions are found to be mitigated and not
disqualifying.  Applicant has reduced the likelihood of foreign influence by being consistently honest
and forthright about his wife's citizenship and employment status.  He disclosed this information
initially on the security questionnaire (SF 86) which he completed in January 1996 during his
background investigation.  The foreign financial interest resulting from his wife's employment by
a foreign government is a concern, but it is reduced considerably by the fact that she earns only about
one-fourth the income Applicant earns from his employment by a DoD contractor.  Her salary from
a foreign government is found to be insufficient to affect Applicant's security responsibilities.  </FONT></P>
