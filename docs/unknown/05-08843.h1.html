<P>On August 16, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an ADP I/II/III position. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application 
under Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program, </EM>(Jan, 1987), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program </EM>(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").<A HREF="05-08843.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On December 2, 2005, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement dated </SPAN>January 28, 2006<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN>The case was assigned to me on May 24, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A notice of hearing was issued on

<P>In 1999/2000, Applicant was overpaid $6,969 due to a payroll error. As a result, $310 was deducted from her paycheck for 13 pay periods. The debt was paid back in 2001. She claims this caused her to 
get behind on making payments on all of her other debts.<A HREF="05-08843.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> During the same time, her mother was a hospice patient.  Her mother's home care added an expense of approximately $150 to $200 a week. 
She and her three brothers shared this expense for approximately five months until her mother passed away in May 2001.<A HREF="05-08843.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></P>

$600 in state income taxes for this past tax year.<A HREF="05-08843.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> She claims that her family is selling some land.  Once she gets the money from the sale of the land, she is going to pay her state income taxes. She 
anticipates she will receive $24,000 from the sale.  She also intends to pay some of her debts.<A HREF="05-08843.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  She did not provide any documentation pertaining to the sale of the land.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those 
individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  (Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.)  It 
is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 1 (<EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>), and FC DC 3 (i<EM>nability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) </EM>apply 
to Applicant's case.  Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations since 1998.  Between 1998 and 2003, she has 16 delinquent debts with an approximate total balance of $30,678.  
Since she only has $100 left over each month after expenses, it is unlikely she will be able to resolve much of this debt.</P> 
 
<P>I considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC). Most of Applicant's delinquent debts remain unpaid.  Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC 1 (t<EM>he behavior was not recent</EM>).  I 
cannot apply FC MC 2 (<EM>it was an isolated incident</EM>), due to her numerous delinquent accounts.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC 3 (t<EM>he conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or 
separation)</EM>) applies. When her mother became terminally ill, Applicant incurred additional expenses to pay for her mother's health care. Her finances were also adversely affected by the payroll error.  
While these events placed a burden on her finances, both of these events occurred in 2001. Since that time, she took no steps towards resolving her delinquent debts. As such, I give this mitigating 
condition little weight.  </P> 
 
<P>I cannot apply FC MC 4 (t<EM>he person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control</EM>).  Applicant has not 
attended financial counseling.  Her delinquent debts remain outstanding. Although at the end of the hearing, Applicant indicated that she will soon receive $24,000 which she will apply towards some of 
the debt, it is unlikely her financial problems will be resolved in the near future. </P> 
 
<P>FC MC 6 (t<EM>he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) cannot be applied as well. Applicant has taken no action towards resolving her delinquent 
accounts. I cannot conclude she made a good-faith effort to resolve her debts.    </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern under Guideline F.  Guideline F is decided against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the trustworthiness determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a 
person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in 
considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own 
merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the evidence and the "whole person" in evaluating Applicant's trustworthiness. An applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage in conduct that has negative 
trustworthiness implications. I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence that Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding Guideline F based on her financial history and 
inaction towards resolving her delinquent accounts. Based on the evidence in the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive 
duties. Eligibility is denied.</P>
