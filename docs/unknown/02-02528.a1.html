  An appealing party that claims there are errors or flaws with the Administrative Judge's decision must show that the Judge committed factual or legal error in writing a decision that falls within the scope of the Board's appellate jurisdiction.  Even if the appealing party makes such a showing, the Board must  consider whether the identified errors are harmful in nature.  Judge erred by finding Applicant owes $670,000 in unpaid federal taxes.  That error is harmless in  light of the Judge's sustainable findings and conclusions.  Applicant failed to demonstrate error that warrants remand or reversal.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>Applicant has appealed the March 3, 2003 decision of Administrative Judge Phillip S. Howe, in which the Judge concluded it is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by the Directive; and (2) whether the 
Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by sufficient record evidence.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's 
decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated October 8, 2002.  The SOR was based on Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR, in which he indicated "I believe that I should forgo the hearing."  A File of Relevant Material (FORM) was 
prepared, and a copy of the FORM was provided to Applicant.  A response to the FORM was received from Applicant.  The case was assigned to an 
Administrative Judge for determination.  The Judge issued a written decision, dated March 3, 2003, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from the Administrative Judge's adverse decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 
2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 
87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal brief sets forth 12 numbered arguments that he labels "Point 1" through "Point 12."  The Board construes Points 1 through 6 as raising the 
issue of whether the Administrative Judge's written decision adhered to the procedures in the Directive, and construes Points 7 through 12 as raising the issue 
of whether the Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by sufficient record evidence.</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by the Directive</SPAN>.  Applicant's Points 1, 2 and 3 take exception to the Administrative 
Judge's summary of SOR allegations.  Applicant's Point 4 challenges the Administrative Judge's characterization of Applicant's answer to the SOR.  
Applicant's Point 5 and Point 6 take issue with the Judge's characterization of Applicant's response to the FORM.  All of these challenges focus on passages in 
that section of the decision below labeled "Statement of the Case."  Applicant's Points 1 through 6 do not raise issues under Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance Item E3.1.32.1<A HREF="02-02528.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> or E3.1.32.3.<A HREF="02-02528.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Making allowances for Applicant's <EM>pro se</EM> status, the Board construes Applicant's Points 1 through 6 as falling 
under Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.2<A HREF="02-02528.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and raising the issue of whether the Judge adhered to the procedures required by the 
Directive.<A HREF="02-02528.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>An Administrative Judge has broad discretion in how to write a security clearance decision, subject to the legal constraints of the Directive and basic concepts 
of due process.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0809 (August 19, 1999) at p. 2.  An appealing party that claims there are errors or flaws with the Judge's written 
decision must show that the Judge committed factual or legal error in writing a decision that falls within the scope of the Board's appellate jurisdiction.  <EM>See</EM> 
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.32.  Furthermore, even if the appealing party makes such a showing, the Board must consider whether 
the identified error(s) are harmful in nature.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine).</P> 
 
<P>Nothing in Executive Order 10865 addresses what an Administrative Judge must include in a written decision.  The only provisions of the Directive that 
specifically address what an Administrative Judge must include in a written decision are Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.25 and E3.1.35.  Nothing 
in those provisions requires that a Judge's written decision have a "Statement of the Case."  Furthermore, the decision in this case satisfies the requirements of 
E3.1.25 to the extent it has findings of fact, discusses pertinent provisions of the Directive (including the Adjudicative Guidelines), reaches conclusions as to 
the SOR allegations, and sets forth the Judge's conclusion as to whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for Applicant.<A HREF="02-02528.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Moreover, Applicant's Points 1 through 6 fail to raise any  material challenge to the Judge's findings of fact, the Judge's discussion of 
pertinent provisions of the Directive, the Judge's conclusions as to the SOR allegations, or the Judge's conclusion as to whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's Points 1 through 6 fail to show that the Administrative Judge's written decision violated Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.25 
or any other procedural requirement of the Directive.  Furthermore, Applicant's Points 1 through 6 fail to show any factual or legal error by the Judge that falls 
within the Board's appellate jurisdiction.  Accordingly, even if the Board were to conclude that Applicant's Point 1 through 6 identify flaws with the Judge's 
"Statement of the Case," such flaws would be, at most, harmless error that does not affect any substantial right of Applicant under Executive Order 10865 or the 
Directive.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by sufficient record evidence</SPAN>.  Making allowances for Applicant's <EM>pro se</EM> status, the Board 
construes Applicant's brief as challenging the Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant owes $670,000 in unpaid federal taxes.  Considering the record 
evidence as a whole, that finding is not sustainable.  However, that error is harmless in light of the Judge's sustainable findings and conclusions.</P> 
 
<P>The Board construes Applicant's Points 7 through 12 as raising the issue of whether various findings of fact made by the Administrative Judge are supported by 
sufficient record evidence.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  In reviewing a Judge's challenged factual findings, the Board must 
consider whether they reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence.  And, as noted earlier in this decision, the Board must consider not only 
whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting 
those findings.</P> 
 
<P>Even if the Board were to conclude that Applicant's Points 7, 8, and 9 had merit, they would fail to demonstrate harmful error by the Judge.  Accordingly, no 
useful purpose would be served by discussing Applicant's Points 7, 8, and 9 in greater detail.</P> 
 
<P>The Board reads the Administrative Judge's decision as finding that Applicant did not falsify a security clearance questionnaire by not listing a state tax lien 
because the state tax lien was not filed until after Applicant completed the security clearance questionnaire.  Given that favorable finding, Applicant's Point 10 
is moot.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's Points 11 and 12 rely on factual assertions by Applicant that constitute new evidence, which the Board cannot consider.  <EM>See</EM> footnote 4 of this 
decision.  And, in any event, the sentences in the Administrative Judge's decision that Applicant's Points 11 and 12 challenge are  sustainable in light of the 
record evidence in this case.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating error below that warrants remand or reversal.  Accordingly, the Board affirms the Administrative 
Judge's security clearance decision.</P>
