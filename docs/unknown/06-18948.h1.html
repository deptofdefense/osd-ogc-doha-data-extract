<P>Applicant's background investigation revealed a 1997 bankruptcy which was the result of too much credit card debt. She currently has ten delinquent debts incurred post-bankruptcy with a total 
approximate balance of $13,679.  Several periods of unemployment and her husband's terminal illness adversely affected her ability to pay her bills. Although she has paid one account and is

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On November 2, 2005, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an ADP I/II/III position. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the 
application under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").<A HREF="06-18948.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On August 31, 2006, 
DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under </SPAN>Guideline F, 
Financial Considerations.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement dated </SPAN>September 12, 2006<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN>The case was assigned to another administrative judge on October 17, 2006, 
and transferred to me on November 1, 2006.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A notice of hearing was issued on November 13, 2006, scheduling the hearing for </SPAN>November 30, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The hearing was conducted on that date. The 
government submitted Government Exhibits (Gov Ex) 1- 2 which were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, and submitted 11 exhibits which were 
marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-K, and admitted without objection. The record was held open until December 14, 2006.  No documents were submitted.</SPAN> DOHA received the hearing transcript

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations.  </P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>Inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts) </EM>apply to Applicant's case.  Applicant first encountered financial difficulty around 1997.  She filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1997 as a result of too much credit card 
debt. After several years of financial stability, she began to incur delinquent debts in 2002. Currently, she has ten delinquent debts with an approximate total balance of $13,679.</P> 
 
<P>I considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC).  Applicant's delinquent debts remain outstanding. Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The behavior was not 
recent</EM>), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>The behavior was isolated</EM>) because she still carries a significant amount of delinquent debt.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a 
death, divorce, or separation)</EM>) applies.  Her husband's terminal illness contributed to Applicant's inability to pay her debts.  Both she and her husband were unable to work full-time since he learned 
of his illness in late 2003.  She was unemployed from October 2003 to March 2004. She had two other periods of unemployment between May 2000 to July 2000 and between July 27, 2005, to 
November 1, 2005.  Although MC 3 applies which explains the cause of the debt, an applicant's actions towards resolving the debt should be considered as well.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control</EM>) does not apply.  
Applicant has not attended any financial counseling. She has paid one debt but all other delinquent accounts remain outstanding.  She did not attempt to resolve her delinquent accounts until 
September 26, 2006.  Given the limited amount of income that she has left over each month, it is unlikely that her financial situation will be resolved in the near future. Of particular concern is the 
fact that Applicant has three open credit card accounts.  Her first bankruptcy occurred as a result of being over extended on credit cards. She has five delinquent credit card accounts alleged in the 
SOR. Given her past history of not paying her credit card accounts, I cannot conclude that she will pay off the balances each month and be able to make payments towards her other unresolved 
accounts.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.1.3.6 (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) is not applicable. While I acknowledge that Applicant has many issues to deal 
with over the past few years, she did not take any action towards resolving her delinquent accounts until September 26, 2006.  She should be commended for starting to resolve these accounts. 
However, I cannot conclude that she has made a good faith effort to resolve her accounts since she did not start to attempt to resolve her accounts until after she was issued the SOR on August 31, 
2006.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness concern. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>Although her evidence of rehabilitation is insufficient at this time, this decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain a state of true reform and 
rehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a trustworthiness position.  Should Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a trustworthiness position in the future and if she were to 
arrange a satisfactory repayment plan with her creditors and timely pay her debts, she may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of trustworthiness.  The trustworthiness concern under financial 
considerations outweighs the mitigating circumstances in Applicant's case.</P> 
 
<P>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a 
person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in 
considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own 
merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the evidence and the "whole person" in evaluating Applicant's trustworthiness. It is premature to grant Applicant a trustworthiness position based on the fact that most of her 
delinquent accounts remain unresolved. With her current income, it is unlikely she will be able to resolve her delinquent accounts in the near future. Based on the evidence in the record, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.</P>
