<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a history of financial irresponsibility, and currently has more than $25,000.00 in delinquent accounts.  He also failed to disclose his delinquent 
accounts, as required, in a Security Clearance Application, Standard Form 86, he executed on June 23, 1999. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security 
concern caused by his financial irresponsibility and personal conduct.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On October 10, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="01-20579.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline E (personal conduct).  Applicant submitted a response to the 
SOR, dated December 31, 2002, and requested a clearance decision based on the written record without a hearing.  In his response to the SOR, Applicant 
denied all of the SOR allegations. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on July 30, 2003, that was mailed to Applicant the same day.  Applicant was outside the 
continental United States at the time the FORM was mailed, and did not actually receive it until August 27, 2003.  Applicant submitted a response to the 
FORM, dated September 24, 2003.  Applicant's response was forwarded to Department Counsel on October 6, 2003.  Department Counsel indicated he did not 
object to Applicant's response.  The case was assigned to another administrative judge on October 31, 2003, and reassigned to me on November 17, 2003, due 
to case load considerations.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 48 years old, single, and the father of a sixteen-year-old child.  He was married on December 14, 1986 and divorced on April 4, 1994.  He served 
on active duty with the United States Navy as a disbursing clerk from December 1976 to December 1996.  He was a petty officer first class, paygrade E-6, when 
he presumably retired.  From the time of his retirement until April 1998 he worked for a number of different employers as a cable technician.  Since May 1998 
he has been employed by a defense contractor as an electronics technician.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The FORM contains four different credit reports issued between December 3, 1999 and July 29, 2003.  Those reports contain multiple entries verifying the 
following debts listed in the SOR: 1.a., a collection account in the amount of $9,856.00<A HREF="01-20579.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>; 1.b., a charged off account in the amount of $6433.00<A HREF="01-20579.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>; 1.c., a 
charged off account in the amount of $2,733.00<A HREF="01-20579.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>; 1.d., a charged off account in the amount of $2,123.00<A HREF="01-20579.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>; 1.e., a paid account/zero balance, account closed at 
consumers request<A HREF="01-20579.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>; 1.f., a bad debt in the amount of $8,513.00<A HREF="01-20579.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>; 1.g., a bad debt in the amount of $2,234.00; and 1.h., this is the same account listed under 
subparagraph 1.e. and described in footnote 5.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on June 23, 1999.  In the SF 86, he answered "No" to question 38: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Your Financial Delinquencies 
- 180 Days - In the last 7 years, have you ever been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?</EM> and question 39: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 Days - Are 
you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)? </EM> As disclosed by the information contained in the credit reports included with the FORM, those answers 
were false.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance.  Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.  Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F, 
pertaining to financial considerations, with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="01-20579.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="01-20579.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a

than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="01-20579.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="01-20579.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="01-20579.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations.  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides 
an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The multiple credit reports included as parts of the FORM disclose that Applicant has over $25,000.00<A HREF="01-20579.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> in delinquent accounts, which have been delinquent 
for many years.  Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>; and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM> apply in 
this case.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a sworn statement to a special agent of the Defense Investigative Service on February 25, 2000 in which he indicated that most of the 
accounts were unknown to him, but that if he did owe them he would arrange payment plans.  He thus was clearly aware these accounts created a security 
concern, and he indicated that he would investigate and take whatever steps were required to alleviate that concern.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Thirty-four months later, in the response he provided to the LOI, Applicant again denied knowledge of most of the accounts.  However, he provided no 
documentation to support his denials or any evidence that he had done anything to resolve the accounts, except the credit report entries that indicated two of the 
accounts were pending dispute resolution as of June 24, 2002.  Ten months after responding to the LOI, Applicant,  in the response he submitted to the FORM, 
again failed to submit any documentation or other evidence in support of his claims of non liability for the multiple delinquent accounts.  Most significantly, he 
did not even submit evidence of the outcome of the disputes noted in the June 24, 2002 credit report<A HREF="01-20579.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government having met its burden in this case, the burden shifted to Applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the 
case against him.  Further, it is Applicant who has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  Despite having almost four years 
to gather evidence and/or documentation to support his claim that he is not liable for the accounts, he submitted nothing.  Accordingly, he has failed to present 
any evidence upon which to find the existence of any mitigating condition(s).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After considering the evidence, I find that Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern caused by his financial irresponsibility.  He has failed to 
overcome the case against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion on that issue.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information.  Applicant had numerous long-standing delinquent accounts at the time he submitted the SF 86 in 
1999, which he failed to disclose.  His denial of knowledge of those accounts is refuted by his failure to provide any support for those denials, despite having 
literally years to gather and submit such evidence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's lack of candor in failing to disclose his financial condition when he submitted the SF 86 and the statements he has provided by way of explanation  
severely undermine the ability to place such trust and confidence in Applicant at the present time.  His false and/or misleading answers and explanations raise 
significant security concerns.  DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security 
questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, 
determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have considered all mitigating conditions under Guideline E and do not find any apply in this case.  After considering the evidence, I find that Applicant has 
failed to mitigate the security concern caused by his personal conduct.  He has failed to overcome the case against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of 
persuasion on that issue.</SPAN></P>
