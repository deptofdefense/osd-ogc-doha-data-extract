<P>Applicant has a history of use of illegal substances (primarily marijuana) while holding a security clearance in the Air Force that he deliberately omitted when 
executing security clearance applications in 2001 and 2002.  This omission is not mitigated under any of the pertinent mitigation guidelines either and raise 
continuing security concerns about Applicant's judgment and reliability.  Besides the Government's falsification and criminal conduct concerns, Applicant's 
history of delinquent debts raises security concerns as well.  His repayment efforts have been too minimal and uncertain to make any safe predictive judgments 
at this time about his debt resolution prospects.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 6, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on April 12, 2004, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on July 15, 2004, and was scheduled for hearing on 
August 12, 2004.  A hearing was convened on August 12, 2004, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of eight exhibits; Applicant relied on five 
witnesses (including himself) and five exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on August 24, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before the close of the hearing, Department Counsel was afforded an opportunity to provide  ISCR case authority for excluding reports of investigation (ROI) 
relied on by an applicant.  The grant was made in connection with an admitted report of investigation from DSS (ex. E).  While Department Counsel never 
provided any contraindicating authority, a search of past ISCR decisions confirmed that  ROIs are not automatically excluded from admission in behalf of an 
applicant but may be considered sans an authenticating witness (hearsay notwithstanding) in the interest of promoting hearing fairness.  <EM>See </EM>DISCR Case No. 
89-2398 (July 1991)(citing DISCR OSD No. 88-2873 (September 1990) and DISCR OSD No. 88-2624 (March 1990)).  The ROI in question is offered in part 
as a counterweight to the exhibits offered by the Government containing adverse information against Applicant (<EM>viz., </EM>exhibits 3, 6, 7, and 8).  Admission of 
Applicant's exhibit E, accordingly, is warranted for reasons of relevancy, materiality, and overall fairness, reasons fully supported by prior DISCR decisions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following the hearing, Applicant submitted a check payment history with one of his medical creditors not listed in the SOR.  The exhibit is received and 
admitted as Applicant's exhibit F.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because of the press of time to conclude the hearing, the parties agreed to submit written closing arguments.  The parties' closing submissions were submitted 
and will be considered.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his security clearance application (SF-86) by omitting (a) his use of illegal drugs while holding a 
security clearance between 1982 and March 1986 and (b) his purchases of illegal drugs from 1997 to December 1998, and to have been terminated by his 
former employer in January 2000 after testing positive for cocaine during a drug test administered in December 1999. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J, Applicant's alleged falsification of his SF-86 are incorporated.  Additionally, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested in October 1991 for 
possession of marijuana, to which he plead guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in a local parish jail (suspended), was fined $4,000.00 and was placed in 
unsupervised probation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have incurred numerous delinquent debts, which have either been charged off or referred to collection agencies: 
altogether,  six creditors, totaling in excess of  $6,000.00.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to active drug addiction, to purchasing illegal drugs in the past (unaware that it was a felony), to being 
terminated by his prior employer for testing positive during an administered 1999 drug test, and to being arrested for marijuana possession in October 1991 and 
later pleading guilty and being sentenced and fined.  By contrast, he denied deliberately falsifying his SF-86, either by omitting his drug use while holding a 
sensitive position (claiming confusion over what is a sensitive position) or by omitting his buying and selling of marijuana from about 1997 to at least 
December 1998 (claiming he limited his purchases and sales to putting in with a few friends and himself for marijuana to be used for their personal benefit.  In 
explanation, Applicant traced his long history of drug activity that culminated in drug addiction during the 80s and continued unabated until he went into 
treatment in March 1999, and permanently (with the aid of NA and AA)  following a relapse in November 1999.  He claimed his listed debts  (Mostly health-related, which he disputes as insurance covered) were associated with his drug/alcohol addictions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 44-year-old aircraft mechanic for a defense contractors who seeks a security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by 
Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Substance abuse history</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant used illegal drugs extensively between 1974 (when he was initiated to marijuana and later other drugs) and November 1999, when he quit using them 
permanently, with the help of NA and AA.  While in the U.S. Air Force (USAF), between 1982 and 1986, he continued to use marijuana and other illegal drugs 
on a daily to weekly basis, while holding a security clearance.  Discharged from the USAF in 1986, he returned to his home state and resumed his active use of 
marijuana, daily for the most part. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the summer of 1986 Applicant began using cocaine and ecstasy.  He continued using these drugs aggressively (at times almost daily) to July 1997, when he 
self-referred himself to a drug treatment center.  Once admitted to this facility's inpatient program, he was diagnosed with cocaine abuse and  marijuana 
dependence, as well as with a depressive disorder and spousal relation problem., on the Axis I scale of the DSM-IV (<EM>see</EM> exs. 7 and 8).   Once discharged, he 
returned to active marijuana and cocaine abuse before he admitted himself to another inpatient substance abuse program in March 1999 (ex. 6).  During his 20-day inpatient stay at this facility he was treated for chemical dependence and discharged to the custody of his spouse. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's lone drug-related arrest occurred in October 1991, when he was arrested for marijuana possession, pled guilty as charged, and was sentenced to 
thirty days in jail (suspended), fined $400.00, and placed on unsupervised probation for one year.  Since this arrest he has had no further encounters with law 
enforcement.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After relapsing to marijuana abuse in July 1999, and cocaine abuse in November 1999, Applicant has remained abstinent with the help of NA and AA, where he 
has been a regular participant and sponsor to others.  His past purchases of illegal drugs were solely for his personal use and friends in his accompaniment.   
Applicant was the intermediary designated by his friends to make the purchases with the pooled money from his friends (R.T., at 167).  While his purchases of 
illegal drugs entailed exchanging drugs for money, his exchanges were always confined to sharing the cost of his purchased drugs with his friends.  His group 
purchases did enable him to buy his own drugs cheaper, but he never resold them to third parties outside his circle of users (R.T., at 168).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was terminated from his former employer in January 2000 after testing positive for cocaine during a drug test administered in December 1999.  He 
doesn't dispute his prior use of cocaine and accepts the test as accurate.  His positive test was the only time he tested positive during his employment with this 
former employer (R.T., at 165). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>SF-86 omissions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When completing his SF-86 of November 2001 (ex. 1), and again in January 2002 (ex. 2), Applicant omitted his use of marijuana while holding a security 
clearance in the USAF (between 1982 and 1986) when responding to question 28 on both questionnaires.  He attributes his omission to confusion over what 
kind of jobs were considered sensitive ones and assures he did  not deliberately falsify his answer to question 28 (R.T., at 174).  While he was candid about his 
listing of the illegal substances he used (marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine) within the previous seven years in answering question 27, he also expressed 
embarrassment about his years of drug abuse and addiction.  Question 28 does not confine its inquiry to drug use while holding a sensitive position, but 
includes use while possessing a security clearance as well.  And when answering question 31, he openly acknowledged his being granted a DoD security 
clearance in March 2002 (<EM>see</EM> exs. 1 and 2).   Educated and familiar with the forms he was provided, he made no tangible effort to reconcile his question 28 
omissions with his acknowledged grant of a security clearance in question 31.  Such inconsistencies make it implausible to accept his omission explanations of 
confusion over what kind of job he held..  Limiting the extent of his admitted drug involvement is a manifest interest of Applicant which cannot be discounted 
when assessing the credibility of his falsification denials.  Taking into account Applicant's claims and all of the surrounding circumstances, inferences warrant 
that Applicant's omissions of his illegal drug use while possessing a security clearance in the USAF were consciously and deliberately made.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Besides his question 28 omissions, Applicant also omitted his prior drug purchases and sales.  He attributes these omissions to his confusion over whether his 
buying and sharing the costs of drug purchases with the friends with whom he used them with represented the kind of large drug transactions he believed at the 
time question 29 addressed (R.T., at 138-40, 172-73).   He claims he never associated splitting the costs of illegal drugs with friends to constitute purchasing 
and selling drugs for profit (R.T., at 140, 173); even though his cost-splitting purchases enabled him to obtain his own drugs cheaper.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concerning his question 29 purchase/sale omissions, Applicant withheld information from his mother about his buying and selling drugs (albeit, she never 
asked him about it) and never voluntarily told his spouse of his purchases and sales (R.T., at 171).  And he had no facility clearance officer (FSO) at his 
company to help him through the drug-related questions (R.T., at 174).  Applicant's explanations about his confusion over whether his kind of cost-splitting of 
marijuana represented purchases/sales of marijuana covered by question 29 are not unreasonable ones given the intended for profit qualification in the question.  
His cost-splitting claims are reconcilable, too, with the language contained in his ensuing DSS statements (where he admits to buying and reselling marijuana to 
support his drug use without mentioning profit) and his answer to the SOR (which omits entirely any reference to buying or selling for profit).  Considering the 
nature of Applicant's cost-splitting initiatives covering his marijuana purchases and sharing with friends, the absence of any third party sales of marijuana 
outside of his immediate circle of users, his confusion claims contain sufficient merit to avert inferences of deliberate falsification with respect to his negative 
answers to question 29 of his SF-86.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several months after completing his SF-86 forms, Applicant was interviewed by a DSS agent (in March 2002).  In his statement given to the agent (ex. 3), he 
detailed his entire history of substance abuse and treatment,  including his continuous abuse of illegal drugs while he was in the USAF.  Reconcilable are his 
acknowledgments of buying and reselling marijuana from 1997 to December 1998 to support his drug use without any mention of profit.  Whether or not he 
was confronted with any adverse information about his using illegal drugs while holding a security clearance in the USAF, or later buying and reselling drugs, is 
unclear from his statement or hearing  testimony.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Debt history</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between 1996 and 1999 Applicant accrued both consumer credit and medically related debts that  he failed to address in a timely way due to a variety of 
reasons: unemployment, taking on a new job, moving, going through a marriage separation, and inferentially support of his drug needs (R.T., at 145).  Debts he 
permitted to become delinquent during his heavy period of drug involvement include two consumer accounts he attributes to his spouse while they were 
married ( <EM>i.e., </EM>creditors 1.a and 1.b) and several unpaid debts for medical services that Applicant claims should have been paid by his medical insurance carrier 
(creditors 1.c through 1.f).  Despite assuring the interviewing DSS agent in March 2002 that he would look into the listed delinquent accounts in his credit 
report (<EM>see</EM> ex. 5; R.T., at 187-90), to date he has failed to mount any sustained follow-up effort beyond a few phone calls.  He provides documented payment 
with only one of his creditors (ex. F), and this  is not a creditor identified in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Currently, each of the covered accounts remain unpaid or otherwise resolved.  Some of the bill consolidation companies he has talked to he doesn't trust, and he 
has no desire to pursue bankruptcy.  Unable to make any tangible headway with either his consumer or medical creditors, he has channeled most of his available 
net monthly resources (around $2,100.00 a month) towards  maintaining his child support obligations and current household expenses (R.T., at 146-47, 158-61).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Character references</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is highly regarded by his NA sponsor who lauds his commitment to a drug-free life and the progress he has made over the past five years in ensuring 
his continued abstinence from illegal substance abuse.  Applicant is credited, too, by two former drug abusers, one of whom Applicant sponsored in NA, with a 
very instrumental role in keeping them committed to being drug free and job worthy.  This individual places high trust and reliance in Applicant's help and 
characterizes Applicant as a person highly devoted to the pursuit of drug abstinence.  Former and current coworkers and supervisors who are familiar with 
Applicant's work and drug/alcohol history credit Applicant with being reliable and trustworthy (<EM>see</EM> exs. A and E).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding 
that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the 
evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and 
materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the 
evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns are raised in this case over Applicant's omissions of his prior drug use while possessing a security clearance in the USAF and his cost-sharing 
of illegal drugs over a 1997-1998 time period   The Government also raises security concerns over Applicant's termination by his previous employer over a 
positive drug test, his prior arrest and conviction for marijuana possession, and the delinquent debts he accrued, which he has not taken care of.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Personal Conduct Issues</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Of particular  security concern to the Government  are Applicant's documented omissions of his drug use while in the USAF and his more recent purchases and 
resales of marijuana among his co-users over two year period spanning 1997 and December 1998.  He attributes his omissions  to his mistaken reading of 
questions 28 and 29.  Specifically cited by Applicant is his confusion over what kind of position he held with the USAF and whether his splitting activities 
represented buying and selling illegal drugs for a profit.  Applicant's explanations of his drug purchasing/selling omissions (confusion over the meaning of 
purchasing and selling for a profit) were persuasive enough to avert inferences of knowing and wilful omission of drug purchases/sales for a profit and enable 
him to refute the allegations of falsification of question 29 of his SF-86 forms covered in subparagraph 2.b (governed by Guideline E) and reincorporated in 
subparagraph 3.a (governed by Guideline H). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, Applicant's  explanations for omitting his use of marijuana while possessing a security clearance in the USAF (question 28) were not persuasive.  
Disqualifying Condition (DC) 2 (falsification of a personnel security form) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal conduct is fully applicable, and is not 
mitigated by any prompt, good-faith correction.  Without clear evidence of a prompt, good-faith disclosure of the adverse information when interviewed by 
DSS a few months later, he cannot take advantage of the mitigation benefits covered by MC 3 (prompt, good-faith disclosure) of the Guidelines.  As a 
consequence, he is unable to mitigate the falsification allegation covered by subparagraph 1.a.  So, while favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the 
falsification allegations covered by subparagraph 1.b of Guideline E, unfavorable conclusions issue  with respect to subparagraph 1.a of the Guideline. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because of the isolated nature of his positive drug test in January 2000 and the sustained commitment he has maintained towards avoiding illegal drugs since 
this first and only positive drug test with his former employer, safe predictions can be made that he will not succumb to illegal drug use in the foreseeable 
future.  Applicant is, accordingly, absolved of any potential manifestation of pattern dishonesty or rule violations.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect 
to subparagraph 1.c of Guideline E. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Financial Issues</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his spouse accrued considerable delinquent consumer and medical debts between 1996 and 1999.  Altogether, Applicant and his spouse 
accumulated consumer and medical  debts in excess of $6,000.00, which Applicant has failed to make any tangible progress in addressing.  The Government's 
security concerns center on the amount of delinquent debt he compiled between 1996 and 1999, which he has been unable to repay.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> remains exposed to potential debt collection efforts on some of his debts, while facing charge offs on the others, which in the past he has either been 
unwilling or unable to pay.  On this record, two of the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations apply: DC 1 
(history of not meeting financial obligations) and DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant's accrued debts are accompanied by some extenuating circumstances (<EM>viz., </EM>unemployment, moving, taking on a new job, going through a 
marriage separation, and active drug use that required considerable money to support), for the most part, his finances have permitted modest attempts to address 
not only his consumer debts but his medical debts (which he continues to claim are disputed sans any documentation).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's debts are neither extenuated nor mitigated enough to enable him to take advantage of any of the mitigating conditions at this time.  His combined 
income is sufficient to enable him to address his old debts, either directly or through arranged debt consolidation.  Extenuation is not demonstrated sufficiently 
to invoke MC 3 (conditions largely beyond the person's control) of the Guideline.  His overall repayment efforts consist essentially of continued promises to 
contact his old creditors and remain a work in progress:  insufficient at this time to invoke any of the mitigating conditions of the Guidelines, primarily MC 6 
(initiated good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors) based on his repayment efforts to date  The Appeal Board has counseled against according much weight 
to general promises to pay which are not accompanied by positive repayment efforts.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-30304 (April 2004); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
(December 1999).  Put differently, an applicant's promises to achieve resolution of his outstanding debts in the future are not a substitute for a documented 
track record of remedial actions.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 98-0188 (April 1999).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because of his considerable drug history, it is especially important for Applicant to be able to demonstrate steady progress in stabilizing his finances. Yet for the 
most part, he has not made any tangible progress in addressing his delinquent debts.  Taking into account all of the circumstances of Applicant's accumulated 
debts, his considerable history of substance abuse, the absence of sufficient attention he has shown with his debts in the past, and the still uncertain results 
associated with his recent efforts of contacting his creditors to address his old debts, more time is needed for Applicant to demonstrate his finances are under 
control.  While he is to be commended by the significant efforts he has made in his own behalf and in behalf of others to promote drug abstinence, it is still too 
soon to make safe predictive judgments about his ability to address his old debts. Applicant's repayment efforts to date in addressing his old debts are 
insufficient at this time to mitigate the Government's financial concerns.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 2.a through 2.f of the 
allegations governed by the Adjudicative Guidelines pertinent to Guideline F.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Criminal Conduct Issues</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">That none of Applicant's SF-86 omissions resulted in formal charges and adjudication against Applicant does not mean that the falsification issues may not be 
raised and considered anew in a clearance proceeding such as the present.  Our Appeal Board has repeatedly stated that the government can prove applicant 
engagement in criminal conduct, even in the absence of a criminal conviction.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 94-1213 (June 7, 1996).   Accordingly, two of the 
disqualifying conditions of the Guidelines for criminal conduct may be invoked: DC 1 (criminal conduct regardless of whether the person was formally 
charged) and DC 2 (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Unlike Guideline E-covered omissions, Guideline J is designed to afford more recognition to an applicant's overall judgment and reliability history.  Still, an 
applicant must meet the requirements of at least some of the mitigation conditions if he is to successfully mitigate its related falsification parameters under 18 
U.S.C. Section 1001. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's failure to disclose his daily drug use while holding a USAF clearance, when coupled with his 1991 marijuana possession arrest and conviction, 
establishes a sufficient pattern of criminal conduct to preclude him from showing isolated circumstances.  While his meritorious work record and  positive 
efforts in overcoming drug abuse  warrant favorable consideration in weighing the extent of his exhibited rehabilitation, these considerations are not sufficient 
to meet the mitigation requirement of evidenced clear rehabilitation to entitle him to take advantage of MC 6 (clear evidence of successful rehabilitation) of the 
Adjudicative Guidelines at this time.  More time is needed before Applicant is in a position to make the case his rehabilitation efforts are sufficient to mitigate 
the criminally-related features of his drug use omissions and earlier marijuana possession arrest that together comprise a pattern of criminally-related conduct.  
Based on a full review of the evidence and drawn inferences from the developed record, unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraph 3.a and 
3.b of Guideline J as well.</SPAN></P>
