<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 17, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant 
and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 13, 2001. The case was assigned to the undersigned on December 10, 2001. A Notice of Hearing was 
issued on December 17, 2001, and the hearing was held on January 9, 2002. The transcript was received on January 17, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is thirty-seven years of age. He is employed by a defense contractor in the telecommunications industry.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 1988, applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Promoting a Dangerous Drug III (Methamphetamine) and (2) Endangering the Welfare of a Minor, 
after he was found in possession of crystal methamphetamine (cm) while in the company of his minor girlfriend.  In October 1990, the court accepted a deferred 
guilty plea from applicant on the first charge on the condition that he enter a drug treatment program and remain there until discharged with the concurrence of 
his probation officer.<A HREF="01-06270.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The second charge was dismissed. In November 1992, the court revoked the acceptance of the deferred guilty plea and found applicant 
guilty of Promoting a Dangerous Drug after he tested positive for an illegal drug on a drug test administered by his probation officer. Applicant was sentenced 
to thirty days in jail. During the next several years applicant violated his probation at least three more times, and on each occasion he was jailed and/or had his 
probation extended. Applicant was finally discharged from the original probation in March 2001 (Exhibit 9).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In June 1990,  applicant was arrested and charged with Failure to Return a Rental Car. He had rented a car through a friend who worked at a rental agency. 
Eventually he stopped paying for the rental, and when the police stopped him while he was driving the car, he was arrested. He was found guilty of the charge 
and sentenced to thirty days in jail.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 1994, applicant was arrested and charged with Escape after he left a halfway house on a pass and did not return. He was sentenced to additional jail 
time.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In September 1994,  applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Fraudulent Use of a Credit Card and (2) Promoting a Detrimental Drug III (marijuana), after he 
was caught using a credit card that he knew he was not authorized to use. He was found guilty of the first charge and sentenced to four days in jail. The second 
charge was dismissed. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested in April 1998 and charged with Abuse of a Household Member. The charge was dismissed.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government alleges that applicant intentionally falsified material facts in response to two questions (Questions 26 and 27) on a Security Clearance 
Application (SCA) (G-1) that he executed on November 24, 1998. Question 26 appeared on the SCA as follows:</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 26.<STRONG>  Your Police Record - Other Offenses</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25? (Leave out traffic fines of 
less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.) For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been "sealed" 
or otherwise stricken from the record. The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which 
the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded "no" to question 26. His "no" response was false because, as noted above, he had been arrested, charged and/or convicted on a variety of 
charges on two occasions in 1994 and once in 1998. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 27 appeared on the SCA as follows:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 27. <STRONG>Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Illegal Use of Drugs</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example marijuana cocaine, crack cocaine, 
hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, 
PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs? </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded "no" to Question 27. His response was false because he had used cm on a regular basis through at least 1993.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has consistently denied that he intended to mislead the Government about his criminal background or drug use when he responded "no" to these 
questions. During an interview with a DSS Special Agent in November 2000, the certified results of which are in evidence as Exhibit 6,  applicant stated that he 
had listed only his 1988 arrest on the SCA "because he felt that was his main arrest and that once his background investigation commenced, the other arrests 
would surface and then he could elaborate on them." At the hearing he testified, in essence, that he followed his secretary's advice that as long as he mentioned 
his 1988 arrest for Possession and the fact that he was on probation, he could properly respond "no" to these two questions (TR at 52-53). He later testified that 
he does not know why he responded "no" to question 27 (TR at 68), and doesn't know why he did not list the other arrests in response to question 26 (TR at 69-70). Based on the evidence presented, I do not find applicant's testimony that he was not trying to mislead the Government with his "no" responses to be 
credible and worthy of belief.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two letters and a performance appraisal were admitted into evidence (Exhibits A, B and C). These documents establish that applicant has performed well at his 
job since 1997.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></SPAN><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth Guidelines (divided into conditions that could raise security concerns and conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns) which must be followed by the Administrative Judge. Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the following Guidelines are applicable:</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The evidence establishes that applicant has a long history of criminal conduct. Beginning in 1988, and continuing to November 1998, applicant committed 
numerous crimes. These crimes, which involved possessing illegal drugs, failing to return a rental car, and fraudulently using  a credit card, among others, 
reflect adversely on his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness, and strongly suggest that he cannot be relied upon to safeguard classified information.</P> 
 
<P>The evidence further establishes that beginning in the late 1990s, applicant started to turn his life around. He has not used an illegal drug in over five years, he 
has been gainfully employed since 1997, and he currently has a stable relationship with his girlfriend. Even his former probation office commented in an 
October 2001 letter (Exhibit 7) that, despite his extensive criminal history, applicant <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">has managed to become a contributing member of the community. These 
are positive factors in his favor, and had applicant not intentionally falsified material facts on his SCA, they would have gone a long way toward mitigating his 
criminal conduct. However, applicant did falsify material facts on the SCA, and in assessing applicant's current security-worthiness, this dishonest and criminal 
conduct<A HREF="01-06270.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> cannot be ignored. Considering the evidence as a whole, particularly the recency of applicant's falsification of the SCA, it is not now clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant him access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
