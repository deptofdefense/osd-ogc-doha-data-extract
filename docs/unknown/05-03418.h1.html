<P>Applicant, a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor, retired from the military after 20 years of service. In 1993 and 2004, the police charged him with 
assault on a family member. His first charge was dismissed six months later by the court when no further abusive conduct occurred. The second charge resulted 
in one year of probation and attendance at an anger management course. He is respected by his supervisor and co-workers, who describe him as a

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>On September, 16, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive. DOHA 
recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. On October 
12, 2005, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. He requested a hearing. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>This matter was assigned to me on January 30, 2006. A notice of hearing was issued on March 6, 2006, and a hearing was held on March 28, 2006. Three 
government exhibits and six applicant exhibits were admitted into evidence. The record was held open until April 12, 2006, for Applicant to submit additional 
documentation. The additional documentation was received on April 12, 2006. The government did not object to the admission of this evidence, which has been 
admitted as Applicant Exhibit G.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant and two witnesses testified. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on April 7, 2006.<BR>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>PROCEDURAL RULINGS</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>At the hearing, the government moved to withdraw subparagraph 1.a. of the SOR on the grounds it did not have sufficient evidence to establish its case.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> 
(2)</SUP></A>Applicant did not object.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The government's motion was granted and subparagraph 1.a. of the SOR was withdrawn.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A><BR>

<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>In his response, Applicant denied the allegations in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c. of the SOR.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> After a complete review of the evidence in the record and 
upon due consideration, I make the following findings of fact:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 48-year-old engineering technician for a defense contractor.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> He has worked for this contractor or its predecessor for seven and one-half years.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> 
(7)</SUP></A>He retired from the United States Navy in 1998 with 20 years of service.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> He never received any disciplinary actions while in the Navy.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> He held a security 
clearance for 28 years.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> He completed a security clearance application (SF 86) in February 2004.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>In 1982, Applicant married.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> At this time, his wife had two sons, ages 6 and 4.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> He raised these boys as his own.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> He and his wife had a daughter and a 
son.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>Since their marriage, he and his wife have argued about disciplining the children, and over their responsibilities at home, such as making their beds and 
picking up their rooms.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> While he was at sea during Operation Desert Storm, his wife bought a fixer up house without his knowledge.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>His wife usually favored the two older sons in any dispute.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> Her conduct directly led to his first arrest for assault and battery on a family member in August 
1993.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> As a high school senior, Applicant's oldest son announced that he was giving up playing his trumpet.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> Because the son was going to college on a 
band scholarship, they argued about the son's decision.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> The son, who had been lifting weights and thus, growing stronger, didn't want to listen to Applicant.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> 
(22)</SUP></A> The son charged him, then picked him up off the floor.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> When the son refused to put him down, Applicant put his son in an arm bar (a wrestling move) 
and brought him down to the floor.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> The son became angry and he had to restrain his son.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> His wife then called the police and Applicant was arrested.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant and his wife appeared in court on October 1, 1993.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> His son did not because his wife sent him to school.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> Applicant pled nolo contendere.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> The 
court found the evidence sufficient, and ordered family counseling, requested his appearance in six months, and directed no further acts of abuse.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> On April 1, 
1994, the court dismissed the case.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Eleven years later, in September 2004, the police again arrested Applicant for assault and battery on his daughter.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> He and his wife began discussing a 
problem with the checking account balance and absence of money.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> When he told his wife that he was going to call the bank, she picked up the telephone and 
threatened to call the police.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> He grabbed the telephone from her with his left hand and pulled his arm back over his shoulder.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> When he pulled his arm 
back, he accidently hit his daughter on the lip.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A> He thought she was on the stairs 20 feet away and did not realize she had moved behind him.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> His wife 
called the police, who arrested him.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appeared in court without counsel shortly thereafter.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A> He spoke with an attorney, whom he later learned was the prosecutor in his case.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> The 
prosecutor asked whether he intended to plead guilty or not guilty.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A> She also told him that he would do jail time, even though he accidently hit his daughter.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> 
(42)</SUP></A>Based on this conversation, he pled guilty to a misdemeanor offense, and did not tell the court that the incident was an accident.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> The court sentenced him 
to one year probation, and directed that he attend anger management classes, which he did.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>During their marriage, his wife opened many charge accounts, some in both names and some in her name, without his knowledge.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A> The bills became his 
responsibility.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A> His wife did not tell him that she had refused the recommendations of their youngest son's teacher for special education support and that she 
had taken their son out of school to home school him.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A> She did not tell him when another son dropped out of college or when his daughter dropped out of 
college.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A> His wife also supported their children, instead of insisting that they work.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_49_"><SUP> (49)</SUP></A> Issues arose with his wife over buying and maintaining cars for their 
children.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_50_"><SUP> (50)</SUP></A> She often blew issues out of proportion, then threatened to call 911 to get her way.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_51_"><SUP> (51)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>In 2004, his youngest son moved out of the house after they argued, and refused to move home unless his father left.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_52_"><SUP> (52)</SUP></A> His wife then requested that court issue 
a restraining order against Applicant, saying she was afraid of him.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_53_"><SUP> (53)</SUP></A> He appeared in court.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_54_"><SUP> (54)</SUP></A> The court told his wife she would not receive child support as 
her children were over 18.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_55_"><SUP> (55)</SUP></A> He agreed that she could have her car, and he would move out of the house so she could move back into the house.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_56_"><SUP> (56)</SUP></A> The court 
told her that since she had the car and house, and Applicant would stay away for two years, he would not need to pay the house note if she moved back into the 
house.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_57_"><SUP> (57)</SUP></A>She then told the court she was not afraid of him.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_58_"><SUP> (58)</SUP></A> He continued to pay the bills and recently moved back into the house.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_59_"><SUP> (59)</SUP></A> His wife is now living 
out of state.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_60_"><SUP> (60)</SUP></A>He plans to proceed with a divorce.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_61_"><SUP> (61)</SUP></A><BR>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. An administrative judge need 
not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when 
applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the adjudicative process provision in Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive, are intended to assist the 
administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. Although the presence or absence of a 
particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be 
measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security clearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the 
whole-person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of 
participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_78_"><SUP> (78)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_79_"><SUP> (79)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_80_"><SUP> (80)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of the 
evidence.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_81_"><SUP> (81)</SUP></A>Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome 
the case against him.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_82_"><SUP> (82)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_83_"><SUP> (83)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance,<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_84_"><SUP> (84)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_85_"><SUP> (85)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_86_"><SUP> (86)</SUP></A> Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national 
interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned." The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.<A HREF="05-03418.h1.html#N_87_"><SUP> (87)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct - Guideline J: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the 
allegations set forth in the SOR:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline J. Applicant has been arrested twice for domestic assault on a family member. His criminal conduct 
raises Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.E2.A10.1.2.1. (Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the 
person was formally charged).<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>I considered Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC). Both domestic violence incidents are misdemeanor offenses under state law. The incident with 
his son occurred over 12 years ago. During an argument, Applicant's son became aggressive towards him by coming at Applicant, then lifting him off the floor, 
in a demonstration of his son's strength. When his son refused to put him down, Applicant used a wrestling move to gain control over the situation. Instead of 
calming the situation, his wife called the police. The court directed family counseling, then dismissed the case. The court clearly did not view this situation as 
out of control or in need of intervention. Before this incident, Applicant had never been involved with the military or local police regarding any criminal conduct.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Despite the ongoing family arguments, particularly those with his wife, Applicant was not involved in any additional domestic violence situations for 11 years, 
even though his wife often threatened to call the police when she could not get her way. His more recent domestic assault charge did not result from an 
intentional act, but the accidental striking of his daughter during a fight with his wife. Since his wife has regularly threatened to call the police or 911 during 
arguments, she called as she believed she had a reason. While his action meets the legal definition of assault, he had no actual intent to harm his daughter. He 
simply wanted to take the telephone away from his wife.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Based on the advice of the prosecutor who made it very clear that he would go to jail if he did not pled guilty, he did so to his own detriment. He successfully 
completed the anger management program and has not had any further difficulties with his family. While his plea weighs against him, the fact he made it 
without the advice of counsel and based on the advice of the prosecutor who would benefit from a guilty plea outweighs the negative impact of his plea.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>His domestic violence charges occurred 11 years apart. They are isolated incidences, not a pattern of conduct. He has no other criminal record with the police. 
His military record lacked any disciplinary actions. His co-workers and supervisor describe him as non-confrontational and calm. He is a reliable and 
dependable employee who has assumed a certain level of responsibility at work. He supported his family and raised four children, two of whom were not his 
natural born sons. Rather than work as a team with him in raising their children, his wife regularly worked against the discipline and order he tried to bring to 
the home. His wife sought a restraining order as a tool to remove Applicant from the house so that their youngest son would move back home. She used the 
court to get what she wanted. For more than 20 years, he regularly fought with his wife over disciplining their children and teaching them responsibility. Now 
that they are grown, he has decided to end the arguing and fighting. After living apart from his wife for some time, he has decided to divorce her and move 
forward in a new direction with his life. Applicant has mitigated the governments concerns under CC MC E2.A10.1.3.1. (The criminal behavior was not 
recent), CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2. (The crime was an isolated incident), CC MC E2.A10.1.3.4. (The . . . factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur), and 
CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6. (There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation). Accordingly, for the reasons stated, I find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant.<BR>
