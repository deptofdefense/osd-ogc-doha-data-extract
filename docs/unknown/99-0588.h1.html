<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 1, 1999, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed
reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to
determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on January 11, 1999 and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record. 
Applicant was furnished the File of Relevant Material (FORM) on February 23, 2000, and is credited with receiving it on March 17,
2000.  Within the time permitted, he provided a written response to the FORM. The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge
on April 20, 2000.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER>
</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 35-year old employee for a defense contractor (Company US), where he has been employed for about sixteen years. 
He has held a security clearance since April 28, 1995 and seeks to retain the same.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is alleged to have (a) used  marijuana on at least May 25 and 26, 1998, (b) been tested positive for marijuana during </SPAN>a drug
test given by his employer (Company US) on June 4, 1998, was removed from his employment until June 15, 1998, been referred to a
drug counseling program and  been subjected to random drug tests for one year, and (c) used marijuana above and after he had been
granted a secret clearance on April 28, 1995.</P>

<P>Additionally, Applicant is alleged to have adulterated his urine sample with fertilizer during a random drug test given by his
employer (Company US) on May 28, 1998 and denied his using illegal drugs or adulterating his urine when initially interviewed by
Dr. A on June 4, 1998.</P>

<P>For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations.  In mitigation, he  claimed that his first and only drug
involvement was over eighteen months previous.  He claimed to have completed drug counseling and has no intention of using drugs
in the future.  Claiming to have voluntarily corrected the wrong, he assured he has never been in trouble before.  Applicant claimed a
good work record that includes several upgrades, excellence awards and attendance awards, as well as an achievement award in June
1999.  And he contended that losing his clearance would be detrimental to his career.</P>

<P><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Appellant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and
material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P>

<P>While at a friend's barbeque in the evening of May 25 and early morning hours of May 26, 1998, Applicant tried marijuana, smoking
four to five marijuana cigarettes that were passed around.  The marijuana belonged to a guest, who he did not know.  Over an eight-hour period, he estimates to have taken ten to fifteen marijuana puffs.  The marijuana made him feel nauseous and dizzy and caused
him to vomit later in the evening.  Consciously aware that his using any illegal substances was incompatible with his holding a
security clearance, he chose to smoke marijuana in hopes that it would relieve the pain of an abscess on his gums.  Applicant has a
history of gum-related problems, for which he had undergone root canal and gum surgery to correct.  He has not used marijuana
before or since, and assures his  intention of avoiding any illegal drugs in the future.</P>

<P>Randomly selected by his employer (Company US) to be drug tested on May 28, 1998, Applicant panicked over his fears of what
negative implications a positive drug test result could have on his clearance and job.  Fearful of detection, he adulterated his urine
sample with ammonia nitrate fertilizer the day before in anticipation of neutralizing any positive presence of marijuana in his system.
The purposely adulterated nitrates prevented any positive test reading and afforded Applicant some initial cover.</P>

<P>After the nitrates were identified by the testing laboratory, Applicant was scheduled for retesting (on June 4, 1998).  The test results
from his administered June 4 urinalysis proved positive for marijuana.  When initially confronted with the test results (<EM>i.e., </EM>on June 4,
1998) by his employer's company physician (Dr. A), Applicant denied ever using illegal drugs.  He firmly denied adulterating his
urine, too; albeit, he admitted to taking ammonia nitrate fertilizer the day before.  He was characterized by Dr. A to be very
cooperative in this initial session, but noticeably upset as well.  </P>

<P>The following day (on June 5, 1998), Applicant consulted again with his company's physician.  In this meeting Applicant and Dr. A
talked freely about Applicant's test situation and arranged a meeting for later in the afternoon of the same date.  Unable to dispel his
sense of guilt over masking his marijuana use, he called Dr. A at his home in the evening of June 5 and admitted to adulterating his
urine sample.  In this conversation, he arranged a meeting with Dr. A for June 9, 1998 to discuss his marijuana use.  In this June 9
meeting, he both acknowledged his use of marijuana at a friend's barbeque in the evening of May 25 and early hours of May 26, 1998
and knowingly and wilfully adulterating his urine to avert testing positive at his randomly selected May 28 urinalysis session. </P>

<P>Following his positive urinalysis retest in June 1998, Applicant was temporarily suspended from his place of attendance (<EM>i.e., </EM>on June
15, 1998), company-referred to ACORN (a drug counseling program) for treatment,  and subjected to random drug testing for one
year.  Over the ensuing months, he completed Narcotics Anonymous ("NA") classes, ACORN counseling sessions and participated in
a special drug testing program consisting of 36 tests (each of which produced negative results for Applicant).  Not content with his
counseling and testing success, he signed on to a random drug testing pool.  Since his last reported positive drug test (<EM>i.e., </EM>his June 4
test results), he has kept himself clean from any illegal drugs (a period of twenty-two months now), which he corroborates in part
with consistent negative random drug test results.  </P>

<P>Applicant has maintained a good work record: both work performance and attendance.  He  remains very remorseful for his drug use
and adulteration mistakes and assures neither will happen again.  His remorse/mistake claims, while manifestly sincere, must await
evaluation of the entire record.</P>

<P><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER>
</P>

<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4, adopted April 20, 1999) lists "binding" policy considerations to be made by
Judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases. The term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board,
requires the Judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying
Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be
granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the Judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In
addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation
and mitigation set forth in E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in  reaching a fair and
impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are
pertinent herein:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Involvement</STRONG></CENTER>
</SPAN></P>

<P>Basis: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified
information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized
disclosure of classified information.</P>

<P><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions</STRONG>:</P>

<P>2.1.  Any drug abuse.</P>

<P>2.2.  Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution.</P>

<P><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions</STRONG>:</P>

<P>3.2.  The drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event.</P>

<P>3.3.  A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER>
</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Basis: conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.3.   Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security
official, competent medical authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness
determination.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.5.  A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating conditions:</STRONG> </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.2.  The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information
voluntarily.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.3.  The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.4.  Omission of material facts was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of unauthorized
personnel, and the previously omitted information was promptly and fully provided.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER>
</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By dint of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be
made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires
Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an
applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all
adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of
record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it
must demonstrate that the facts proven have a nexus to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The
required showing of nexus, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually
mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take
account of accessible risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the
applicant for the purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of
the Government's case.</SPAN></P>

<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN> </STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's positive drug  test and adulterating of his urine sample to avoid detection present troubling concerns about his eligibility
to hold a security clearance despite a credible employment record with his defense contractor.  While his use of the covered illegal
substances days before his positive drug test may have been isolated, he is hard pressed to make the persuasive case in the  wake of
(a) his imputed knowledge that use of illegal substances was incompatible with holding a security clearance (which he held at the
time) and (b) the ensuing efforts he took to conceal his use.  Ignoring any overriding security concerns by his using marijuana and
following his use of the substance with actions designed to divert discovery only complicates his efforts to convince he is at no risk to
use of illegal substances in the future.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In fairness, Applicant does appear to be sincere in his remorse and assurances that he will not use illegal drugs again.  Strengthening
his mitigation efforts, too, is completion of drug counseling,  participation in NA classes and meetings and acceptance of random
drug testing (with 36 negative results so far to his credit) to underwrite any risks of recurrent drug use.  But considering the
circumstances in which he attempted to deceive the Government about his marijuana use, twenty months of drug avoidance is still
insufficient to satisfy the mitigation requisites for making safe predictive assessments against any resumption of marijuana
involvement.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Both the circumstances of Applicant's involvement in illegal substances and the relatively brief time he is able (approximately
twenty-two months) to document discontinuance preclude safe predictions  he is currently fully absolved of  recurrence risks.  True,
his track record to date since testing positive is encouraging (to include his negative random drug tests, completion of his ACORN
counseling and NA participation).  Just the same, his efforts require additional seasoning before he can be absolved of all reasonable
doubts about recurrent use.  Applicant's proofs are insufficient to avert overall unfavorable conclusions with respect to Guideline H.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Equally security significant are Applicant's admitted adulterating of his urine sample to avert an anticipated positive test.  When
initially confronted about the presence of nitrates in his urine by Dr. A following his retesting (on June 4, 1998), Applicant
"panicked" out of concern for losing his job and clearance and declined to acknowledge his deliberate attempts to debase his drug
test.  He declined again to acknowledge his use and test sabotaging actions when interviewed again the next day.  Not until overcome
by conscience later in the day (<EM>i.e., </EM>in the evening of June 5) did he elect to come forward with his admitted use and adulteration of
his urine sample.  So much trust is imposed on persons cleared to see classified materials that margins of tolerance are necessarily
narrow where candor lapses occur.  By his own admissions, Applicant omitted his ingestion of nitrates in the belief it could foil his
scheduled urine test out of concern for his job and security clearance. That he may not have adequately appreciated the implications
of his actions is not sufficiently developed to assess the materiality of his claims.  Manifestly, he made deliberative choices about
prioritizing his own job/clearance interests over the Government's public interests in evaluating any effects of his using illegal drugs
on his suitability to hold a security clearance.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With due respect to Applicant's personal employment-related interests and harbored concerns over placing his clearance at risk with
an anticipated positive drug test, the Government is fully entitled to have relevant drug test data supplied by existing clearance
holders (such as Applicant) regardless of the potential for personal jeopardy that accompanies full disclosure.  Applicant's omissions,
as such, were made knowingly and wilfully and involve matters material to making a careful assessment of his security worthiness. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's sample debasing was compounded by his failure to correct it when first challenged by Dr. A: following retesting and
again in a follow-up session on June 5, 1998.  While Applicant is credited with making correcting admissions in the evening June 5,
his corrections cannot be characterized as free of confrontation within the definitional parameters of the Adjudicative  Guidelines of 
(for personal conduct).  As such, Applicant cannot justifiably claim the mitigation benefits of either MC 3.2 (isolated omissions), MC
3.3 (prompt, good faith disclosures) or MC 3.4 (reliance on the advice of others).  And his extenuation and mitigation efforts are not
sufficient to enable him to carry his evidentiary burden under Guideline E.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors enumerated in the
Adjudicative Process section of  Enclosure 2 of the Directive.</SPAN></P>
