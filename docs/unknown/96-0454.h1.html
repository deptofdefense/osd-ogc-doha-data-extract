<P>On June 19, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued the attached Statement of Reasons (SOR) to                                               (now                       )<A HREF="96-0454.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> (Applicant), which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and which recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied
or revoked.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on July 8, 1996, and in her Answer she elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a
hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on September 17, 1996. The Government
submitted six exhibits in support of its contentions. Applicant was instructed to submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of
receipt. Applicant received the FORM on September 19, 1996. Her Response to the FORM was due by October 21, 1996, but she submitted no additional
material for consideration.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">The case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on October 28, 1996.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT SIZE="-1">FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the material facts alleged in SOR Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.o., inclusive, and those admissions are hereby
incorporated herein as findings of fact. The following additional findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and subparagraph in the SOR:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Applicant is 26 years old, and she is employed by a defense contractor. On August 23, 1996, the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office was notified by
Applicant's employer that Applicant's name was changed from                                 to                                       . Applicant seeks a DoD security clearance in
connection with her employment in the defense industry.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT SIZE="-1">Paragraph 1 (Criterion F - Financial Considerations).</U>  The Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has a history of not meeting
financial obligations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">With respect to SOR Subparagraph 1.a., Applicant is indebted to Creditor A (credit card company), in the amount of approximately $1,675.00, for a credit card
account opened in December of 1988 and closed in May of 1989 for non-payment. (Exhibits 3, 4, 5, and 6.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">With respect to SOR Subparagraphs 1.b. and 1.c., Applicant is indebted to Creditor B (credit card bank), in the amount of approximately $1,105.00, for a ----
credit card account opened in January of 1989 and closed due to non-payment in January of 1990, and further indebted to Creditor B, in the sum of
approximately $2,046.00, for a ---------- credit card account opened in March of 1990 and closed due to non-payment in November of 1990. (Exhibits 3, 4, 5,
and 6.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">With respect to SOR Subparagraph 1.d., Applicant is indebted to Creditor C (collection agency), in the amount of approximately $437.82, for a ---- credit card
account opened with a credit card bank in October of 1994, and assigned to Creditor C for collection by that credit card bank in December of 1995. (Exhibits 3,
4, 5, and 6.) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">With respect to SOR Subparagraph 1.e., Applicant is indebted to Creditor D (department store), in the amount of approximately $105.00, for a credit card
account opened in May of 1990 and closed due to non-payment in March of 1991. (Exhibits 3, 4, 5, and 6.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">With respect to SOR Subparagraph 1.f., Applicant is indebted to Creditor E (department store), in the amount of approximately $163.00, for a credit account
opened in May of 1990 and closed due to non-payment in May of 1991.(Exhibits 3, 4, 5, and 6.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">With respect to SOR Subparagraphs 1.g. and 1.h., Applicant is indebted to Creditor F (a government agency which is guarantor of student loans) in the
approximate amounts of $1,226.00 and $2,736.00, for student loans obtained from a credit union in November of 1988 and assigned to the government agency
for collection in May of 1993 due to non-payment. (Exhibits 3, 4, 5, and 6.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">With respect to SOR Subparagraphs 1.i. and 1.j., Applicant is indebted to Creditor G (collection agency), in the amounts of approximately $52.00 and $75.00,
for non-sufficient funds checks written in June of 1990 and March of 1992. (Exhibits 3, 5, and 6.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">With respect to SOR Subparagraph 1.k., Applicant is indebted to Creditor H (collection agency), in the approximate amount of $27.13, for a non-sufficient
funds check written in December of 1990. (Exhibits 3 and 6.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">With respect to SOR Subparagraph 1.l., Applicant is indebted to Creditor I (collection agency), in the approximate amount of $56.34, for a non-sufficient funds
check written to a discount store as payee in September of 1989, and assigned to the collection agency for collection in October of 1991. (Exhibits 3 and 6.) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">With respect to SOR Subparagraphs 1.m. and 1.n., Applicant is indebted to Creditor J (collection agency), in the approximate amounts of $28.86 and $544.00,
for debts owed to a telephone company and assigned to the collection agency for collection in February and April of 1990. (Exhibits 3 and 6.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">With respect to SOR Subparagraph 1.o., Applicant is indebted to Creditor K (credit card bank), in the approximate amount of $787.00, for an unpaid credit card
account opened in May of 1989 and closed in June of 1989. (Exhibits 3, 4, 5, and 6.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Applicant also had her car repossessed in approximately May of 1989. The lender then obtained a deficiency judgment against Applicant, and garnished her
wages in order to satisfy the judgment. (Exhibits 4 and 5.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In her National Agency Questionnaire of November 2, 1995, Applicant explained that she had become delinquent in the payment of her debts because she
experienced "financial difficulties," and because when she was a freshman in college she "didn't know the value of maintaining good credit." (Exhibit 4.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In her signed, sworn statement dated March 4, 1996 (Exhibit 5), Applicant gives the following explanation for her financial problems:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">"In the past I was attending school, working part-time, and sometimes I had not (sic) job. I was sent credit cards, and used them irresponsibility (sic). When I
was unable to make the payments, I just let them go."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Applicant's only  asset is her car. Her gross monthly salary is $1,820.00, and her net monthly income is $1,323.00. Deducting her $440.00 in monthly expenses
and her $595.00 in monthly debt payments from her net monthly income leaves her with a net remainder of $288.00, part of which she could apply to her debts.
(Exhibit 5.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In Exhibit 3, Applicant's Response to the SOR, dated July 8, 1996, she explains the reasons for her financial problems as follows:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">"I fell into debt my freshman year of college, and was ignorant to the value of maintaining good credit, and being totally irresponsible for my actions. I was
employed part time during my freshman year and shortly after, I was no longer employed (due to my school schedule). My busy schedule permitted me to get
further into debt considering that, it was impossible for me to avail myself for work. I have held previous part time jobs since then, but the income wasn't
sufficient to cover what was owed to these creditors. I did make agreements with the creditors to pay what I owed. However, I did so until I was no longer
financial (sic) able to continue making these promised payments. May 6, 1996 I decided to file a Chapter 7 in the Bankruptcy Court of (a city). My hearing is set
for July 9, 1996 at 8:00 am. At this hearing a Bankruptcy Judge will decide whether to bar me from the debts that I owe. I chose this option considering that, I
was getting deeper and deeper into debt."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Attached to Applicant's Response to the SOR is a photocopy of a legal form titled "Notice of Commencement of Case Under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy
Code, Meeting of Creditors &amp; Fixing of Dates," and that form recites that Applicant filed a Bankruptcy Petition on May 6, 1996, representing herself <EM>pro se</EM>.
Applicant has provided no other documents pertaining to that case. She has not provided copies of the Chapter 7 petition's schedules of assets or debts, and she
has not provided a copy of a notice of discharge. Of course, the mere filing of  a petition in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court does not automatically mean that all of the
debtor's debts will be discharged. For example, quite often petitions are dismissed prior to discharge, on the motion of the Chapter 7 Trustee or a creditor, and
quite often creditors successfully move to obtain exception to discharge. In this case, it is noted, for example, that the debts owed to Creditor F are federally
guaranteed student loans, a category of debts which normally are not dischargeable in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy proceeding. Indeed, based upon the
documentation provided by Applicant, it cannot even be determined whether the creditors enumerated in the SOR were included as creditors in the Chapter 7
petition's schedule of creditors. Unfortunately, even later, after Applicant received the FORM and had another opportunity to provide further documentation
from her Bankruptcy Court proceeding,  as part of her  response to the FORM, she did not do so. Applicant submitted no additional material in response to the
FORM. Based upon the documentation provided by Applicant, it cannot be determined whether, and I cannot find that, the debts listed in the SOR have been
discharged in a United States Bankruptcy Court proceeding.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT SIZE="-1">Mitigation.</U> In Exhibit 3, Applicant's Answer to the SOR , she states, "I'm now a more responsible individual, who has learned a valuable lesson in maintaining
good credit, and paying what I owe." She has recently tried to address her adverse financial condition by filing a Chapter 7 Petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court.  In Exhibit 5, Applicant's written statement, she states that she realizes the importance of being financially responsible, that she is now more mature, and
that she has a steady job.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1">POLICIES</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines and policies for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and these guidelines
must be given consideration in making security clearance determinations. The following adjudicative guidelines and policies are found to be applicable in this
case:</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT SIZE="-1">Criterion F (Financial Considerations)</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Conditions that could raise a security concern:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">(None of the Directive's Enclosure 2 mitigating conditions apply to the facts of this case.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In addition, the general adjudication policies expressed at Paragraph F.3. of  the Directive and in Enclosure 2 of the Directive have been considered as to each
criterion in this case. Enclosure 2 provides, in pertinent part, as follows: "The adjudication process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as
the whole person concept. All available information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a
determination. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should consider the following factors:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">"The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">"The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">"The frequency and recency of the conduct.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">"The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">"The voluntariness of participation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">"The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">"The motivation for the conduct.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">"The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">"The likelihood of continuation or recurrence."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In DOHA cases the Government has the initial burden to go forward with persuasive evidence in support of the factual and conclusionary allegations in the
SOR. If the Government meets this initial obligation, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation
which is sufficiently persuasive to overcome or outweigh the Government's case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security clearance</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1">CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for a
security clearance has a history of not meeting financial obligations, is unable or unwilling to satisfy debts, or may be financially overextended so that she is at
risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving under Criterion F that Applicant owes in excess of $11,000.00, in the aggregate, to the 11
different creditors named in SOR Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.o. Considering Applicant's meager assets and relatively small net monthly income, the evidence
leads to the inescapable conclusion that Applicant is "financially overextended," as alleged in the SOR. Clearly, the aggregate amount of Applicant's debt
became excessive and burdensome, and it therefore developed into a condition which has adverse security clearance significance. As set forth in the findings of
fact, above, based upon a careful consideration of all of the evidence in this case, I cannot conclude that Applicant's recent filing of a petition in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court has discharged any or all of the debts owed to the creditors named in the SOR. Applicant simply has not provided sufficient persuasive
evidence in refutation, explanation, or mitigation to overcome the Government's evidence which establishes Applicant's long history of failing to meet her
financial obligations, and her inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Applicant has failed to pay debts which became due as long as seven years ago, and she has failed to pay debts which were incurred as recently as 1994. There
is no evidence that she ever made a good-faith effort to repay her creditors, or to otherwise resolve her debts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In this case, there is an element of adverse security clearance significance not only in Applicant's condition of being in debt, but also in her conduct which led to
the debts. By her admittedly irresponsible conduct of spending beyond her means, which led to so many different debts, and by failing to timely pay her debts
over such a long period of time, Applicant has demonstrated poor judgment and unreliability. A security clearance holder must exercise good judgment and
reliability in the protection of classified information. Applicant's failure to act responsibly in such important matters of personal financial obligation suggests
that she may not be counted upon to act responsibly in the protection of classified information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">On balance, it is concluded that Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing her request for a DoD security clearance. I recognize that
Applicant's irresponsible behavior in financial matters began when Applicant was an immature college student. However, her irresponsible behavior in failing
to address her debts lingered until recently, May of 1996, when she apparently began a proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court. Until that time, there is no evidence
that she made any real effort to repay her debts. Her behavior was neither isolated nor ancient. Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against Applicant as
to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">For the reasons stated, I conclude that Applicant is not suitable for access to classified information.</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1">FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></U></FONT></P>
