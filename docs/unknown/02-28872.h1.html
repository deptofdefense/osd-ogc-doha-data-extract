<P>Applicant has a history of three alcohol-related incidents over a seven-year period between 1994 and 2001 and continued drinking without any documented 
diagnosis or prognosis of his condition.  His restorative efforts to date, while encouraging, are insufficient to enable safe predictive assessments about his ability 
to avoid recurrence in the foreseeable future.  Security concerns are raised, too, over Applicant's determined deliberate omission of a 1995 criminal offense 
from his security clearance application.  Applicant fails to fully mitigate government security concerns about his alcohol offenses and arrest omissions as well.  
Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 10, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance, and recommended referral 
to an administrative judge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on April 21, 2004, and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant received the File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) on October 10, 2004.  Applicant failed to respond to the FORM within the 30 days afforded him to provide supplement 
documentation regarding the issues.   The case was assigned to me December 29, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline G, Applicant is alleged to have (a) consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from Approximately 1993 or 1994 to 
at least June 2002 and (b) been arrested (while intoxicated) on three occasions over a seven-year period spanning 1994 and 2001: in October 1994 and charged 
with breaking and entering and grand larceny (felonies), in July 1998 and charged with DuI and refusal of a blood/breath test, and in July 2001 and charged with 
resisting arrest and public intoxication.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his security clearance application (SF-86) by omitting his March 1995 arrest for credit card fraud and 
larceny/steal property (charges not prosecuted).  Under Guideline J, Applicant's arrests and SF-86 omission are incorporated by reference.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations, denying only that he falsified material facts (<EM>viz., </EM>his March 1995 arrest) in his 
November 2000 SF-86.  Applicant added explanations to his answer.  He claimed he has ceased alcohol consumption for some time.  He claimed to have 
sought counseling (not specific about who and when), attended alcohol safety programs (dates, course materials and results omitted), and still voluntarily visits 
a counselor on a regular basis (specifics not provided).  He claimed to have learned his lessons about alcohol and shed his habit since becoming professionally 
engaged, and to have been unaware that his SF-86 arrest omission was a matter of importance to his security application.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS AND FACTS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 38-year software engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by 
Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant consumed beer in high school, mostly on weekends where he would typically consume two to three beers at parties and social situations.  Upon 
entering college, he increased his alcohol consumption to six to eight beers on weekends, primarily at fraternity parties and Greek social activities.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between 1994 and 2001, Applicant was involved in three alcohol-related incidents.  The first of these incidents occurred in October 1994, while Applicant and 
several college friends were out socializing.  Applicant had consumed some five beers at various bars and was intoxicated when police arrived to investigate an 
early-morning break-in of a local music store.  Applicant was arrested and charged with breaking and entering and grand larceny (both felonies).  The court 
deferred adjudication of his breaking and entering count and took his grand larceny count under 12-month advisement, subject to Applicant's completing 200 
hours of community service, donating $3,000.00 to a local narcotics fund, paying restitution, and keeping the peace for the 12-month period under advisement.  
Upon satisfactorily completing the court's requirements, both counts were dismissed.  Applicant complied with the court's conditions (including 200 hours of 
community service at his university) and is credited with excellent evaluations. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested again several months after his 1994 arrest (in March 1995) and charged with credit card fraud and larceny steal property.  The charges 
were not prosecuted.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During an evening with friends in a local restaurant in July 1998, Applicant consumed several beers and sideswiped two cars on his way home.  Investigating 
police asked him to take a breath test, but he refused both the test and the offered treatment from paramedics on the scene.  Applicant was promptly arrested and 
charged with DuI and refusal of a blood/breath test. At his court hearing, he was found guilty of an amended charge of reckless driving and sentenced to 30 days 
in jail (suspended), fined $250.00 plus court costs, and required to attend a local Alcohol Safety Action Program (ASAP).  The refusal of a blood/breath test 
charge was not prosecuted<EM>.</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his third and last alcohol-related incident of record, Applicant was arrested in July 2001 and charged with resisting arrest and public intoxication.  He had 
consumed about five beers in a local restaurant and had been riding his bicycle when he was stopped by local police for riding in a restricted trolley lane.  The 
arresting officer dropped the resisting arrest charge, and the public intoxication charged was subsequently dismissed.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Besides completing a court-ordered alcohol safety action program (ASAP) in connection with his 1998 DuI incident, Applicant has attended some alcohol-related counseling.  The dates and nature of the counseling and qualifications of the counselors are not documented, however, and cannot be presumed.   Nor 
does Applicant indicate the level of his drinking (if any) since his last alcohol-related incident in 2001.  Absent a diagnosis and  prognosis in the record, a 
factual assessment of the nature and extent of Applicant's involvement with alcohol cannot be made.  Applicant's three alcohol-related incidents over a seven-year period and overall history of alcohol consumption suggest a problem with alcohol, enough to warrant inferences of alcohol abuse associated with his 
drinking and  and related incidents.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Asked to complete a security clearance application in November 2000, Applicant omitted his March 1995 arrest when answering question 26's inquiry into non-felony offenses within the previous seven years.  Applicant doesn't attribute his omission to confusion over the question or memory lapse.  He omitted the 
arrest because he didn't consider the arrest important to his background investigation relative to a security clearance eligibility assessment.  While Applicant's 
explanation is a credible one, it is not enough to avert inferences of knowing and wilful omission.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Prior to his scheduled DSS interview in June 2002, Applicant made no known effort to contact DSS to make any corrections to his SF-86.   When interviewed 
by a DSS agent in June 2002, Applicant failed to disclose his 1995 credit card fraud arrest when asked about his prior arrests.  Applicant's reasons for not 
volunteering details pertaining to this arrest are not clear from either his DSS statement or answer.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the 
risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance 
and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from 
the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant brings to these proceedings a history of excessive drinking and alcohol-related incidents, as well as a security significant omission in his SF-86 of a 
past alcohol-related arrest. These incidences of alcohol abuse and determined intentional omission in his SF-86 serve to impair the confidence in his judgment, 
reliability and trustworthiness required for eligibility to access classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's history of alcohol-related incidents and drinking excesses reflect a pattern of alcohol abuse that is security significant.  On the strength of the 
evidence presented, several disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Adjudication Guidelines for alcohol consumption may be applied: E2.A7.1.2.1 (<EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use</EM>) 
and E2.A7.1.2.5 (<EM>Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To his credit, Applicant has sought counseling.  However, he provides no information about his drinking practices (if any) since his last alcohol-related 
incident.  Without documented  information about any previous diagnosis and prognosis and updated data about his current drinking, not assessment of his 
rehabilitative efforts can be made at this time.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All in all, Applicant's mitigation efforts to date reflect too little documented support to credit him with mitigation of the Government's security concerns 
associated with his past abuses of alcohol.  Without more information and professional assessments about his past and current drinking practices, it would be 
imprudent to credit Applicant generally with successful rehabilitation. Considering the record as a whole, Applicant fails to make the convincing showing that 
he has both the maturity and resource support at his disposal to avert any recurrent problems with judgment lapses related to alcohol to warrant safe predictions 
he is no longer at risk to judgment impairment associated with such conduct.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the alcohol-related allegations 
covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d of Guideline G. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Potentially serious and difficult  to reconcile with the trust and reliability requirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of 
Applicant's alcohol-related arrest  omission in his November 2000 SF-86.  By omitting his 2001 arrest in his clearance application, Applicant concealed 
materially important background information needed for the government to properly process and evaluate his security updates.  He makes no claim of 
misunderstanding the question, which was posed in a straightforward way in the questionnaire.  Applicant attributes his omission to his belief the arrest didn't 
represent material information the Government needed to make an assessment of his clearance suitability: an explanation that has been historically  considered 
by the Appeal Board to be insufficient to avert drawn conclusions of knowing and wilful concealment. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's arrest omission was  knowing, deliberate, and material to a determination about his clearance suitability.  It invites application of one of the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) for personal conduct of the Adjudicative Guidelines: E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or 
misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement or similar form used to conduct 
investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary 
responsibilities</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with,  since he failed to take advantage of the first obvious opportunity afforded him to correct his earlier SF-86 
omission in his DSS interview following completion of his SF-86.  Not only has the Appeal Board found the use of Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A5.1.3.2 of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal conduct (isolated, corrected falsification) to be unavailable to applicants seeking mitigation by treating the omission as 
isolated, but it has denied applicants availability of MC E2.A5.1.3.3  (prompt, good faith disclosure) as well in circumstances (as here) where the applicant has 
failed to take advantage of an earlier DSS interview opportunity.  <EM>Compare </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0289 (January 1998) with DISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 
1995).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available guidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E.2.2 factors), unfavorable conclusions 
warrant with respect to subparagraph 2.a of Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To be sure, each of Applicant's three alcohol-related arrests and dispositions (covered by allegations 1.b through 1.d) and SF-86 omission, are neither isolated 
nor totally unrelated to the period associated with his alcohol-related incidents.  Still, they require separate consideration under the Adjudicative Guidelines 
covering criminal conduct.  Both Applicant's arrests and SF-86 omission reflect mistakes of judgment (even if they didn't all result in convictions), which are 
security significant.  The Appeal Board has repeatedly stated that the government can prove applicant engagement in criminal conduct, even in the absence of a 
criminal conviction.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 94-1213 (June 7, 1996).   Accordingly, two of the disqualifying conditions of the Adjudication Guidelines for criminal 
conduct may be invoked: E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>) and 
E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Unlike Guideline-covered alcohol-related arrests and Guideline E-covered omissions, Guideline J is designed to afford more recognition to an applicant's 
overall judgment and reliability history.  Still, an applicant must meet the requirements of at least some of the mitigation conditions if he is to successfully 
mitigate the separate criminal conduct concerns associated with his arrests and omission.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Both the number of alcohol-related arrests and dispositions involved and failure to correct and imputed deliberate and material arrest omission elated coming 
forward with his full disclosure required at the very least a demonstrated positive shift in attitude by Applicant regarding the collective severity of his alcohol-arrest history and arrest omission and willingness to make documented changes in both his alcohol use and attitude regarding the importance of prompt 
corrections of omissions.  This Applicant has failed to do.  As a result, he is not positioned to avail himself of any of the mitigation conditions of the Guidelines 
for criminal conduct.   More time is needed before Applicant is able to make a convincing case his rehabilitation efforts are sufficient to mitigate the criminally-related features of his arrest history and corresponding SF-86 omission.  Based on a full review of the evidence and drawn inferences from the developed 
record, unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 3.a and 3.b of Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2.1 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P>
