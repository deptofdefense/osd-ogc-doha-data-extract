<P>The Applicant's security clearance was revoked in May of 1988, a fact that he acknowledged by way of correspondence in July of 1988, in September of 1988, 
and in April of 1989.  In October of 1995, however, the Applicant denied that his clearance had ever been "denied, suspended or revoked," when he executed 
his Personnel Security Questionnaire (PSQ).  This lack of candor, coupled with the fact that he admittedly improperly copied computer software from 
1990~1999 and still uses that software, brings into question the Applicant's trustworthiness.  No mitigation has been shown.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 24, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on March 25, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on May 15, 2003.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on May 29, 2003, and submitted nothing in reply.  The case was received by the undersigned for resolution 
on July 10, 2003.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's personal conduct and related misuse of information technology militate against the 
granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant denies all of the allegations, except for allegation 1.c., as it relates to the improper copying of computer 
software, under personal conduct.]</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the File of Relevant Material.  The Applicant is 57 years of age, and is 
employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct &amp; Guideline M - Misuse of Information Technology</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. and 1.d.  In May of 1988, the Applicant's security clearance was revoked (Government Exhibit (GX 7).  The Applicant acknowledged that his clearance 
was revoked or that his access to information was denied in correspondence dated July 6, 1988 (GX 7 at page 1), in correspondence dated September 20, 1988 
(GX 7 at page 6), again in correspondence dated April 26, 1989 (GX 7 at page 5), and most recently in a sworn statement dated June 10, 1999 (GX 5 at page 
12).  In October of 1995, however, when executing his PSQ, he answered "No" to the question "Have you ever had a security clearance denied, suspended or 
revoked" (GX 4 at page 4).  I find this to be a knowing and wilful falsification.  Furthermore, the Applicant did not come forward and explain his falsification 
until more than three and a half years later, when he executed the sworn statement (GX 5).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b.  In June of 1999, the Applicant did admit to "have taken home some . . . [of his employer's] proprietary information over the past several years," but he 
avers that such conduct was sanctioned by his employer (GX 5 at page 14).  The Government has failed to demonstrate otherwise; and as such, this allegation is 
found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c. and 2.a.  The Applicant admittedly copied computer software without the permission or authorization from the software manufacturer from 1990~1999, and 
he continues to use such software (GX 3 at page 5, and GX 5 at pages 17~18).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant offers little in the way of mitigation, and only tries to explain away his clear falsification.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . ;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">5. A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations . . . ;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Misuse of Information Technology Systems</SPAN></CENTER>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. Removal (or use) . . . of software . . . without authorization;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence that are speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guidelines E (personal conduct), and M (misuse of information technology systems); which establishes doubt 
about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and 
his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not 
required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in 
all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for rules, there then exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the same attitude 
towards security rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was clearly less than candid with the Government when he executed his PSQ in October of 1995.  His access to classified information had been 
denied and his clearance had been revoked six years earlier in May of 1988.  It is clear from the intervening correspondence that he was aware of the prior 
demise of his security clearance, but in his answer he tries to explain away his clear falsification, averring that his access was not really denied nor his clearance 
really revoked.  His explanation is not supported by any other evidence, and, in the context of the entire record, I find it to be not credible.  This poor exercise of 
semantics, coupled with the fact he admittedly has copied and still uses computer software he had no authority to copy, further brings into question the 
Applicant's trustworthiness.  His wilful falsification and continued misuse of information technology are clearly of security clearance significance; and as such, 
Guidelines E and M are therefore found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
