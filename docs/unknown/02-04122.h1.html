<P>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed three separate tax liens filed against Applicant for unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties for tax years 1989, 1991, 1993, 
1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998.  Total amount owed on the three liens was $14,993.34.  He still owes the IRS "about $10,000.00."  Additionally, he falsified his

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On October 15, 2003, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-04122.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-04122.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-Applicant 
failed to meet the financial considerations (Guideline F), and personal conduct (Guideline E) personnel security guidelines of the Directive.  Applicant 
answered the SOR in writing on November 3, 2003, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on January 7, 
2004.  On January 22, 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government offered ten documents, which were admitted without objection as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10.  The Applicant offered two 
documents, which were admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on January 30, 
2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 63-year-old married man, who has three adult children.  Applicant was awarded an associate's degree, and attended approximately a year of 
college beyond that.  He was also awarded a certificate in telecommunications from a local university.  Applicant is employed as a senior voice engineer for a 
defense contractor and seeks a security clearance in order to enhance his employment potential.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed three separate tax liens against Applicant.  The first lien was filed on June 26, 1995, for unpaid taxes, interest, and 
penalties for tax years 1989, 1991, and 1993 totaling $4,789.43.  GE 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The second lien was filed on August 31, 1999, for unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties for tax years 1995, 1996, and 1997 totaling $5,950.01.  GE 4.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The third lien was filed on April 18, 2000, for unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties for tax year 1998 totaling $3,253.90.  GE 5.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to the three federal tax liens, the SOR alleged Applicant owed a credit card company $612.00 as of March 28, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed his security clearance application on October 15, 2001.  Question 35 asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had any property 
repossessed for any reason.  Question 36 asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had a lien placed against his property for failing to pay taxes or other 
debts.  Applicant answered "no" to both questions.  GE 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant explained his tax lien problems arose during a time he was in business for himself and all of his income was going towards living and job expenses.  
He stated, "I never could get far enough ahead that I could pay the taxes, and at that - I think in the middle of - in the mid 90s, the economy took a real big 
downturn and it made it very difficult for me to even proceed with what I was doing and make a liveable wage.  I had a lot of expenses, medical expenses, on 
my wife's part, and that's the only explanation I've got."  Tr. 45.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied owing the credit card debt when interviewed by the defense security service on April 23, 2003, and indicated he had no knowledge of the 
account or debt alleged and suggested the debt may be his son's debt who has the same name as he does.  GE 2, p. 3.  In his Response to the SOR, he indicated 
this debt "[w]as an item I was unaware of and has since been resolved to everyone's satisfaction" and that "[m]y account was being sent to an incorrect address 
since relocated (sic) back to  [new address]."    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's explanation for not listing the tax liens or repossession on his security clearance application is: "I intentionally did not list my tax liens and my 
vehicle repossession because I didn't feel they were issues of a security concern since I had already taken steps to resolve them."  GE 2, p. 3., Tr. 42.  In his 
Response to the SOR regarding the repossession, he indicated, "The reposition (sic) in question when I relocated back to [new address] that was an error in 
timing of payoff of the vehicle.  That item was to be corrected and expunged from my record when the payment was received."  In his Response to the SOR 
regarding the tax liens, he indicated, "The question of the tax liens was due to the fact that while I was correcting these items with the IRS and was with [the 
IRS], I was told that the letters were only to ensure that I would resolve these problems and I was.  I encountered many delays while working these issues 
because of misplaced records and files and a reassignment or retirement of [IRS point of contact]." </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted a letter dated January 22, 2004, from his certified public accountant (CPA) stating that Applicant had submitted an Offer in Compromise 
with the Internal Revenue Service to resolve all federal taxes owed.  His CPA stated Applicant was current on all his federal income tax filings through tax year 
2002.  AE A.  Applicant estimates he owes the IRS "about $10,000.00."  Tr. 26, 27, 47.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted an employee performance appraisal dated January 5, 2004, reflecting above average performance.  AE B.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure (2) of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged the IRS filed three separate tax liens against the Applicant.  The liens included unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties for tax years 
1989, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998.  The total amount Applicant owed the IRS for these three liens was $14,993.34. Additionally, DOHA alleged 
the Applicant owed a credit card company $612.00.  An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations contained in the SOR, except the one contained in &para; 
1.d.  The debt alleged in &para; 1.d. appears to have been resolved.  Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations, &para; DC E2.A6.1.2.1., and has been 
unable or unwilling to pay his debts, &para; DC E2.A6.1.2.3.  Some of the conditions that resulted in Applicant not paying his taxes were beyond his control - the 
economy took a downturn in the mid 1990s when Applicant owned his business and Applicant's wife having uncovered medical expenses.  That explanation 
might carry more weight if Applicant had not had tax liens filed against him for seven, separate years, the last being 1998.  Seven years later, Applicant by his 
own estimate, still </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">owes the IRS "about $10,000.00."  His CPA, however, reports that Applicant has a "pending" offer to the IRS to resolve all federal taxes owed.  There is no 
evidence that Applicant's offer has been accepted or this debt has otherwise been resolved or under control.  &para; MC E2.A6.1.3.4 does not apply.  Applicant's 
lack of due diligence in staying abreast of his income taxes over a lengthy time does not weigh in his favor.  Thus, the number of tax years involved and 
Applicant's failure to resolve an original $14,993.34 tax liability with "about $10,000.00" still owed does not constitute a good-faith effort to pay the IRS or 
otherwise resolve this debt.  &para;<EM> </EM>MC E2.A6.1.3.6.  Under these circumstances, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his tax liens.  I find 
against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified his security clearance application by deliberately failing to disclose his vehicle repossession and past tax liens.  
Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations 
could indicate that an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations contained in the SOR.  Applicant's falsifying his 
security clearance application constitutes the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from his security clearance 
application, which application is used to determine his security clearance eligibility.  &para; DC E2.A5.1.2.2.  Applicant's explanation for not listing either his 
repossession or tax liens because he did not feel they were security concerns because he had already taken steps to resolve them is an unacceptable explanation.  
It is not within Applicant's discretion to provide or not provide requested information because he does not believe it to be a security concern.  The security 
clearance application was quite clear in terms of what was requested and Applicant chose to provide false answers.  None of the mitigating conditions listed in 
the guideline apply to Applicant's case.  I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
