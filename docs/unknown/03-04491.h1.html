<P>Applicant has had a long history of financial difficulties. He has taken little action to pay off his debts, and he still has a significant amount of outstanding debt. 
Based on his tenuous financial situation and his history of financial irresponsibility, Applicant has failed to demonstrate a stable and mature outlook about his 
finances.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance is denied.</SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On February 17, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated </SPAN>March 15, 2004<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded in writing to the SOR allegations.</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He requested a clearance decision based on a 
hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 14, 2004, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the 
parties on June 4, 2004, and the hearing was held on June 25, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered twenty nine documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1 through 29), and no witnesses were called. Applicant 
offered eleven documentary exhibits, (Applicant Exhibits A through K), and  offered his own testimony. The transcript (TR) was received on July 15, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. The SOR 
contains eight allegations, 1.a. through 1.h., under Guideline F</SPAN>. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his Response to the SOR (RSOR), Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.e., 1.g., 
and 1.h. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon 
due consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 49 year old computer systems analyst for a defense contractor who seeks access to classified information.</SPAN> He is married and has two children, a 
daughter, age 19, and a son, age 26. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> received a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science in 2000.</P>

in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This overdue debt to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is in the amount of $142,687 for failing to pay his Federal taxes for tax years 1988 through 
2001(Exhibits 27and 29). Applicant admitted this debt was due and owing in his RSOR. At the hearing he testified that not only has he not made any payment 
on this debt, but he failed to pay his Federal taxes for tax years 2002 and 2003. Applicant claimed that he has recently filed for bankruptcy, and that he is 
attempting to reduce the amount owed to the IRS, but he offered no evidence that the IRS has reduced this debt </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(TR at 40-43). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find that he owes the entire

In his RSOR, Applicant admitted  that this debt is due and owing. 
Since Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">has made no payment on this debt, I find that he owes the entire amount stated.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

debt in November 2003 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(TR at 43-44)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN> Since Applicant failed to introduce any independent evidence to establish that this debt has been paid, and the 
September 17, 2003 credit report still lists this as an outstanding debt, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> owes the entire amount stated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Exhibit 12)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN></P>

full on this debt. </SPAN>Since Applicant failed to introduce any independent evidence to establish that this debt has been paid, and the September 17, 2003 credit 
report still lists this as an outstanding debt, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> owes the entire amount stated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Exhibit 12)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

2003 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(TR at 46)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN>Since Applicant failed to introduce any independent evidence to establish that this debt has been paid, and the September 17, 2003 credit

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 6</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is listed in the SOR for a civil judgment awarded against Applicant in the amount of $2,354. In his RSOR, Applicant 
contended that his wife owes this debt, but he would attempt to pay the amount owed to resolve it.  During his testimony, Applicant admitted that he was told 
by a judge in the civil case, that he owes this debt. He also stated that he has made no payment on this debt but he has listed it on his latest bankruptcy filing 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(TR at 48)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Since I have received no evidence of the status of this bankruptcy, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have determined that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> owes the entire amount stated. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.g. Applicant filed a voluntary position for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy on October 20, 2000.  He listed assets of $1,900 and liabilities of $122,100 (Exhibit 10). 
Applicant failed to discharge his debts, because he dismissed the bankruptcy on March 2, 2001. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.h. Applicant filed a voluntary position for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy on November 19, 1999  (Exhibit 11). Applicant failed to discharge his debts, because he 
dismissed the bankruptcy on February 10, 2000. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant cited two primary reasons for his failure to resolve his debts. These included the illnesses and deaths of a number of his family members and his 
involvement in a number of vehicular accidents.  However, Applicant could not show a nexus between these incidents and his inability to file tax returns and 
pay his taxes for tax years 1988 through 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the 
overall common sense determination required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 
2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>              Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of 
persuasion then shifts to Applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, 
despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. 
Assessment of Applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency 
and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. 
Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to guidelines F:</SPAN>   <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline F, the Government has established that </SPAN>Applicant has had a long history of financial difficulties. The evidence has shown that 
Applicant has taken far too little action to pay off these debts.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Based on his extremely large debt to the IRS, he has a long way to go before his debts are 
resolved.</SPAN> Based on his tenuous financial situation and his history of financial irresponsibility, Applicant has failed to demonstrate a stable and mature outlook 
about his finances. I, therefore, resolve Guideline F against Applicant.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both DC E2.A6.1.2.1., and DC E2.A6.1.2.3 apply, because of Applicant's history 
of not meeting financial obligations and his inability to satisfy his debts. I find that none of the Mitigating Conditions (MC)  apply. </SPAN></P>
