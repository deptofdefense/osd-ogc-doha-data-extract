<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER>
</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On September 3, 2002, pursuant to Executive Order No. 10,865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified
Information Within Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department
of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, the Defense Office of Hearings and
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant that specified reasons why
DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied
or revoked.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	In the SOR the Government alleged that Applicant was disqualified from obtaining a security
clearance because of his illegal drug involvement (Guideline H) demonstrating a history of marijuana
use while he held security clearances in 1979 and 1988, and personal conduct (Guideline E)
demonstrating questionable judgment, based upon his continued use of marijuana and his failure to
reveal his drug use on security clearance applications and in interviews with Defense Security
Service agents.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	By Memorandum dated November 15, 2002, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth
in the SOR and requested that his case be determined on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  The
Government submitted its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on December 3, 2002.  By letter dated
December 3, 2002, a copy of the FORM was forwarded to the Applicant, with instructions to submit
additional information and/or any objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the
FORM on December 16, 2002, and on December 31, 2002, he requested extra time to file his
response to the FORM.  Department Counsel granted Applicant an extension of time until January
21, 2003 to file his response to the FORM.  On February 3, 2003, the case was assigned to me for
a decision.  The memorandum of assignment made no mention of the extension of time granted to
Applicant by Department Counsel and indicated that Applicant's response to the FORM was due on
January 15, 2003.  The record I received on February 3, 2003, did not contain a response from
Applicant to the FORM.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On April 22, 2003, I issued a decision denying a security clearance to Applicant.  The record
provided to me on remand shows that Applicant appealed my decision and, on June 25, 2003, filed
an appeal brief with DOHA's Appeal Board.  With his appeal brief he filed a copy of his response
to the FORM, dated January 16, 2003.  The record further shows that by Memorandum dated June
25, 2003, the Appeal Board Chairman served Chief Department Counsel with a copy of Applicant's
appeal brief and notified him that the deadline for filing a reply brief was July 15, 2003.  By
Memorandum to the Chief Department Counsel, dated July 21, 2003, the Chairman of the Appeal
Board stated that no reply brief had been received and, accordingly, Applicant's case on appeal was
deemed ready for consideration by the Appeal Board.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	By decision dated August 19, 2003, the Appeal Board remanded my decision, with
instructions to me to determine whether Applicant did or did not submit a timely response to the
FORM.  The Appeal Board further directed that if I found Applicant's response to the FORM to have
been received timely, or good cause was found for receiving it late, I should consider his response
to the FORM as part of the record for purposes of making findings and reaching conclusions about
the SOR allegations.  I was further instructed that if I found Applicant's response was untimely and
there was not good cause to accept it late, then I should issue a new decision that included a specific
discussion and explanation for that ruling.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On March 8, 2004, I issued an order directing the parties to provide me with the following
information no later than close of business, March 23, 2004:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>		Applicant . . . [shall] . . .submit to me, by registered mail  . . . a narrative,
under oath or affirmation, discussing the circumstances under which he submitted his
response to the FORM to DOHA.  Applicant should tell with whom he
communicated, and when.  Applicant should also specify how he transmitted his
response and whether it was sent by e-mail, e-mail attachment, through the U.S.
Postal Service, by private postal carrier . . . or by any other means.  If Applicant used
the U.S. Postal Service to send his response, he should indicate whether he used
registered or certified mail, express or priority mail and whether a tracking or return
receipt was requested and received.  Applicant should include with his narrative true
copies of all postal, e-mail, or private carrier tracking records pertaining to his
transmission of his response to the FORM and any tracking records indicating
DOHA's receipt of his response to the form.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>		Department Counsel . . . [shall] . . .submit to me, by registered mail a statement, under oath or affirmation, as to whether Applicant's response to the
FORM was received by DOHA.  If DOHA received Applicant's response to the
FORM, Department Counsel should state when the response was received and how
it was docketed--electronically, by annotation on a paper docket card,  . . . or by
electronic or hand date stamp.  Department Counsel is further directed to explain
DOHA's procedures for receiving and logging in Applicant's response to the FORM
and its review processes for ensuring that when it was submitted to an administrative
judge for a clearance decision based on the written record, pursuant to Directive
E3.1.7., it was deemed complete and ready for adjudication.  Department Counsel is
also directed to submit all records relating to oral and written correspondence by
DOHA personnel with Applicant relating to the submission of his response to the
FORM and true copies of all date stamps affixed to documents received from
Applicant.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On Saturday, March 20, 2004, Applicant filed a request, by facsimile, for an extension of
time to comply with my order.  I received a copy of his request on Monday, March 22, 2004, and
served a copy of his request on Department Counsel, who indicated no objection so long as the
extension of time applied equally to both parties.  Accordingly, I granted Applicant's request and
granted both parties an extension of time until close of business March 31, 2004 to respond to my
order of March 8, 2004.  Both parties filed their responses within the prescribed time.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant stated in his narrative statement<A HREF="02-24965.h2.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that he did not recall when his response to the
FORM was due.  He said he called the Department Counsel assigned to his case before Christmas
2002 and explained that his superiors would be unable to review his response to the FORM during
the "holiday stand down."  He requested an extension of time to file his response later in January
2003.  He stated that the Department Counsel responded by telling him she had spoken to the judge
and a date in early January was set for the reply.<A HREF="02-24965.h2.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Applicant stated he provided his written response
to the FORM on January 16, 2003, after review by his superiors, who mailed it to DOHA.  He said
he has no tracking records for delivery of his response to DOHA, but he stated that his security
officer has informed him that a tracking record is on file in his employer's security office.  He said
he addressed his response to the FORM to a security specialist in DOHA.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The Chief Department Counsel filed a statement about whether his office had received
Applicant's response to the FORM, and he provided documentation in support of his conclusions. 
Chief Department Counsel reported that there was nothing in the database of his office or that of the
Special Action, Policy, and Review Division (SAPRD) that would indicate that Applicant's response
to the FORM had been received by either office.  He reported that Applicant had called the lead
Department Counsel in the matter on December 31, 2002, and had requested an extension of time
for filing his response to the FORM.  Department Counsel stated she had no objection to an
extension and granted Applicant a new deadline of January 21, 2003, for submitting his response to
the FORM.  She communicated this information to staff at SAPRD.  On February 3, 2003, SAPRD
staff asked the lead Department Counsel if she had received Applicant's response.  Lead Department
Counsel reported she had received nothing from Applicant, and, accordingly, SAPRD transmitted
the case to DOHA's Washington Hearing Office, where it was then assigned to me.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The Chief Department Counsel also stated: "Although there is no indication that the exhibit
offered with the Applicant's appeal was ever received by either SAPRD or Department Counsel, we
nonetheless do not object to the Administrative Judge considering on remand the materials submitted
by the Applicant along with his appeal brief."  (Department Counsel Response, dated March 31,
2004, at 1.)</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	As the parties' submissions show, there is disagreement as to whether Applicant's response
to the FORM was timely filed.  Applicant claims he gave his response to the FORM to his security
officer, but, contrary to my order, he has provided no evidence to support his assertion.  He
apparently relied on his security officer to transmit his response to the FORM to DOHA.  It is not
clear from Applicant's submissions whether it was company policy that all submissions related to
security clearance matters be reviewed and submitted to DOHA by the security officer.  It is also not
clear whether Applicant informed his security officer of the new deadline he had received from
Department Counsel.  These ambiguities in the record, along with Department's Counsel's lack of
objection, lead me to find good cause to consider Applicant's response to the FORM as part of the
record for purposes of making findings and reaching conclusions about the SOR allegations. 
Accordingly, Applicant's response to the FORM is admitted into in the record of this case, and my
findings include a careful review of that document, dated January 16, 2003.</P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">	</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record and upon due
consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant is a 55-year-old senior analyst employed by a Government contractor.  On March
20, 2001, Applicant signed a completed Security Clearance Application, Standard Form 86 (SF 86)
that he had prepared.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Question 31 on the SF 86 completed by Applicant reads: "Your Investigation
Record-Investigations/Clearance.  Has the United States Government ever investigated your
background and/or granted you a security clearance?"  In response to Question 31, Applicant replied
in the affirmative and stated that his background had been investigated and, as a result, he had been
granted Secret clearances in 1979 and 1988.  Question 20 on the SF 86 completed by the Applicant
asks if during the last 10 years Applicant has left a job under unfavorable conditions.  In response
to Question 20, Applicant stated that, as a Federal employee, he had left a job under unfavorable
conditions when his security clearance was revoked in July 1999, pursuant to a finding that he had
used illegal drugs and had omitted or concealed or falsified that illegal use on a security clearance
application</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Question 32 on the SF 86 completed by the Applicant reads: "Your Investigation Record -
Clearance Actions: To your knowledge have you ever had a clearance or access authorization denied,
suspended, or revoked, or have you ever been debarred from government employment?"  In response
to Question 32, Applicant replied in the affirmative that he had lost his security clearance in July
1999. Question 27 on the SF 86 completed by the Applicant reads: "Your Use of Illegal Drugs and
Drug Activity - Illegal Use of Drugs: Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter,
have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana. . . ?"  In response to
Question 27 Applicant admitted to illegal use of the drug marijuana "occasionally" from January 1,
1976 to July 4, 1998.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Question 28 on the SF 86 completed by the Applicant reads: "Your Use of Illegal Drugs and
Drug Activity - Use in Sensitive Positions: Have you EVER illegally used a controlled substance
while employed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing
a security clearance; or while in a position directly and immediately affecting public safety?"  In
response to Question 28 Applicant denied using illegal drugs or controlled substances while
possessing a security clearance, even though his drug use as described in his response to Question
27 encompassed the period of time that he said he held security clearances in his response to
Question 31 and his response to Question 20 indicated that he had left a job under unfavorable
conditions when his security clearance was revoked pursuant to a finding that he had used illegal
drugs and had omitted or concealed or falsified that illegal use on a security clearance application.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Question 29 on the SF 86 completed by the Applicant reads: "Your Use of Illegal Drugs and
Drug Activity - Drug Activity: In the last 7 years, have you been involved in the illegal purchase,
manufacture, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving, or sale of any narcotic, depressant,
stimulant, hallucinogen, or cannabis for your own intended profit or that of another?"In his response
to Question 29, Applicant denied purchasing or trafficking in illegal drugs.  In his response to the
SOR, Applicant admitted to contributing money on occasion to purchase marijuana for his use and
the use of others.  (Applicant's response to the SOR, dated 15 November 2002, at 1-2.)  He stated
that his use of marijuana occurred occasionally at social events and never affected his ability to carry
out his official duties.  </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant denied the Government's allegation 2.d in the SOR, that he failed to reveal the full
extent of his marijuana use in a June 1998 interview with a Defense Security Service agent and that,
because he was not forthcoming about his drug use, a second interview with a Defense Security
Service agent was required in September 1998.  Applicant states that he provided all the information
asked of him but does not deny that the agent visited him several times in order to question him and
obtain the information.  (Applicant's response to SOR, dated 15 November, 2002, at 4.)  Applicant
attached to his memorandum an Enclosure, which he identified as "Enclosure (1): Personnel History
of: [Applicant], Letters of Achievement, Commendations, Awards and Letters of Reference"  The
Enclosure comprised 41 pages and was characterized by Applicant as "documentation of my
character, both personal and professional, my dedication to country, Navy and family." (Applicant's
response to SOR, dated 15 November 2002, at 6.) </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant attached a copy of his response to the FORM, dated January 16, 2003, to the
narrative statement he filed on March 31 in response to my Order of March 8, 2004.  Applicant's
response to the FORM was identified as "ENCLO #2."  The seven-page document contained 13
discussion points, identified as <STRONG>a</STRONG> through <STRONG>m</STRONG>.  In his discussion points, Applicant/Appellant took issue
with Department Counsel's arguments in the FORM.  He asserted he is a responsible citizen and has
an honorable work record.  He averred he has changed his behavior and mitigated the Guideline H
and E disqualifying conduct alleged in the SOR. </P>

<P><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>An Applicant's admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the Government
of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are denied or
otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those
controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden (either
by an applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and establishes conduct that creates security
concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present
evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence
of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the
interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the applicant.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the
Government based upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the Government or
admitted by the applicant raise doubts about the applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness,
the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security
worthy.  In <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531, the Supreme Court concludes that
"[t]he clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they
must, on the side of denials."  Accordingly, I interpret the Court's guidance to mean that doubts
against an applicant's security worthiness are to be resolved against the Applicant.</P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, including Applicant's response to the FORM,
and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those
described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	With respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case.  Applicant has
admitted the Guideline H drug involvement specified in the SOR and identified as disqualifying
conditions under paragraphs E2.A8.1.1, E2.A8.1.1.3, and E2.A8.1.2.1 of Guideline H.  He used
drugs from approximately 1976 through at least 1998 and contributed money on occasion to
purchase marijuana for his own use and that of his companions.  He used marijuana while he held
secret clearances in 1979 and 1988.  Applicant offers in mitigation his assertions that his drug use
ended in 1998 and therefore is not recent  (E2.A8.1.3.1).  He states that his drug use, when it
occurred, was episodic and not regular, that he used marijuana in social settings and never before or
while at work, and that his judgment was not impaired as a result of his drug use.  He directs our
attention to his enclosed Personnel History containing evidence of numerous awards, letters of
commendation, and promotions received while in Government employment as evidence that his
work was not impaired by his drug use.  In his response to the FORM, Applicant faults the
Government for not requiring him to take a drug test when he filled out his SF-86 in March 2001 and
for not recognizing that his employment at that time required tests for substance abuse. (Response
to FORM, Discussion Point l, at unnumbered page 6.)</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant states that he last used drugs five years ago, in 1998.  In 1982 Applicant stated to
a Defense Department investigator that he was giving up the use of drugs at that time.  Had this
occurred, Applicant would have demonstrated his intent not to abuse drugs in the future, mitigating
factor E2.A8.1.3.3 under Guideline H.  However, Applicant admits to using marijuana for the next
16 years, until at least July of 1998.  Thus, Applicant's drug involvement spanned a period of many 
years and was not isolated or aberrational, but appears to be a part of his on-going social life. 
Mitigating condition E2.A8.1.3.2 thus does not apply.  Absent Applicant's ability to demonstrate that
he was able to stop using drugs, his assertion that his last drug abuse occurred in 1998 and thus is
not recent lacks credibility and cannot mitigate, pursuant to E2.A8.1.3.1, Applicant's long-standing
pattern of drug abuse. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant's enclosed Personnel History contains many references to his hard work and
effective occupational functioning during the time he has admitted using drugs.  However, these
positive references do not speak to the basic security concern expressed in paragraph E2.A8.1.1.1.
of Guideline H, which is that illegal drug involvement, which alters mood and judgment, raises
questions about an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information and may
increase the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified material. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	With respect to Guideline E, the Government has also established its case.  Applicant admits
personal conduct under paragraph E2.A5.1.1 of Guideline E that puts in question his judgment,
trustworthiness, reliability, honesty and willingness to properly safeguard classified information. 
His continuing drug abuse while holding two security clearances and his attempts to conceal that
information raises serious questions under paragraphs E2.A5.1.2.2 and E2.A5.1.2.3 about his
security clearance eligibility and trustworthiness.  Applicant used marijuana in the years 1976 until
at least July 1998, and this drug use occurred even though he held a secret clearance granted in 1979
and a secret clearance granted in 1988.  Applicant also used marijuana for 7 years (1982 to at least
1989) despite his assertions in 1982 to a Defense Security Service agent that, because of his family
responsibilities, he had no intention of using marijuana in the future.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant failed to reveal his marijuana use when he completed his SF 86 in April 1998 and
did not discuss the matter until an interview with a security investigator in June 1998.  Applicant lost
his security clearance in 1999 because of his marijuana use and his failure to reveal it on his SF 86. 
Additionally, he failed to reveal his use of marijuana when he completed another SF 86 in March
2001 and denied ever using a controlled substance while holding a security clearance even though,
in response to another question on the SF 86, he admitted to occasional drug use during periods
when he had held security clearances.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant denies that he failed to reveal the full extent of his marijuana use in his June 1998
interview with a Defense Security Service agent, an omission that required an additional interview
to elicit the full and accurate history of his marijuana use.  Applicant states that he gave all the
information asked of him during two "official" interviews and in several more informal interviews
which occurred when the Defense Security Service agent visited him, often unannounced.  Applicant 
states that he failed to treat the agent with sufficient respect at the time of the interviews and further
asserts that he was under considerable stress from his work responsibilities at the time of the
encounters with the Defense Security Service agent.  Applicant's amplifying statements do not
demonstrate that he was initially forthcoming or fully cooperative when interviewed about his use
of marijuana by the Defense Security Service agent.  Applicant has failed to mitigate, under
paragraph E2.A5.1.3.2, the disqualifying conditions described in paragraphs E2.A5.1.2.2 and
E2.A5.1.2.3 of Guideline E.  The falsifications on the Forms SF 86 he filed in 1998 and 2001 were
not isolated incidents.  While the falsifications filed in 1998 are not recent, those filed in 2001, in
connection with the security clearance application herein under review, are recent.  While Applicant
eventually provided correct information, he did so only after repeated inquiries by an agent of the
Defense Security Service, leading to a conclusion that Applicant lacked candor and was unwilling
to comply with rules and regulations, thus raising concerns about his willingness or ability to
safeguard classified information.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	It is the combination of drug use and drug-related falsifications that establish Applicant's
current ineligibility for access to the nation's secrets.  However sincere Applicant may now be in his
intentions, he has not established his ability to conform and sustain his conduct to the standards of
good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of anyone seeking a security clearance.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	In my evaluation of the record, I have carefully considered each piece of evidence, including
Applicant's response to the FORM, in the context of the totality of the evidence and under all of the
Directive guidelines that were generally applicable or might be applicable under the facts of this
case.  Under the whole person concept, I conclude that Applicant has a serious problem relating to
his drug use and his continuing lack of candor about the drug use, leading to a series of falsifications
about his conduct while he held security clearances.  I have carefully considered all evidence
presented by Applicant as mitigating or extenuating, including the evidence provided in his response
to the FORM, dated January 16, 2003, and I find that Applicant's evidence falls far short of being
convincing.  Under the totality of the facts and circumstances of this case, I conclude that Applicant
has not mitigated any of the SOR allegations.</P>
