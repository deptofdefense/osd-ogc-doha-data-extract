<P>Applicant has failed to fulfill the requirements of the Memorandum from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and 
Intelligence, dated August 16, 2000, entitled "Guidance to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of the Foreign Preference 
Adjudicative Guideline" (Money Memorandum) by refusing to return his current Russian passport to the Russian Government. Additionally, he has stated that 
he has no intention of renouncing his Russian citizenship.  Finally, his mother, maternal grandparents, and at least 10 other relatives are citizens of and reside in 
Russia. Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated February 5, 
2003, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct 
proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. The SOR was based on foreign preference (guideline C) related 
to his exercise of dual citizenship with the United States and Russia, his intention to continue to retain a Russian passport and continue to use it for travel; and 
on foreign influence (guideline B) concerns because of the foreign residency and/or citizenship of close family members (wife, mother, father, grandparents and 
other relatives).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated March 10, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He requested that his case be decided on the written 
record in lieu of a hearing. On May 9, 2003, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM)<A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A> was provided to the Applicant, and he was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. 
Applicant had until June 27, 2003, to file a response to the FORM, but no response was received. The case was assigned to me on July 10, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline C (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Foreign Preference</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">) and Guideline B (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Foreign Influence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">) of 
the Directive. The SOR contains two allegations, 1.a. and 1.b., under Guideline C, and eight allegations, 2.a. through 2.h. under Guideline B. Applicant 
admitted all of the SOR allegations. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and upon due consideration 
of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is 24 years old, married, and is employed as a business development analyst by a United States defense contractor.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference). The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in 
such a way as to indicate a preference for another country over the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant was born in Moscow, Russia. He moved to the United States in 1995, and he became a United States citizen in 1998. In a sworn statement, made to 
the Defense Security Service, and signed by the Applicant on January 14, 2002,  he stated that he would not renounce his Russian citizenship. (Exhibit 6.) In the 
year 2000, Applicant renewed his Russian passport after he had lost the previous one, and his current passport does not expire until March 2005.  He continues 
to retain his current Russian passport. Applicant stated that he was not willing to relinquish his Russian passport. He stated that he would neither renounce his 
Russian citizenship nor relinquish his current Russian passport because "the benefit does not justify the cost."(Exhibit 6.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence). The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has 
immediate family members or people to whom he may be bound by affection or obligation who are not citizens of the United States, or may be subject to 
duress. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's mother, maternal grandparents, and at least 10 other relatives are citizens of and reside in Russia.  His father and wife are dual citizens of Russia 
and the United States and reside in the United States. Applicant has weekly telephone contact with his mother and grandparents. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination required. 
Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other 
pertinent behavioral changes; the potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in 
the future. <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2. Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it 
should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. Moreover, although adverse 
information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information 
reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior. See Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section 
E2.2.4. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A3.1.1. The Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be 
prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A3.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A3.1.2.1 The exercise of dual citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A3.1.2.2. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport<STRONG>.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries 
are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, 
a foreign country.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.3.1. A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in 
question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty 
to the person(s) involved and the United States.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon 
an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination 
required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In 
addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Decisions under the Directive include 
consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets its burden and 
establishes conduct cognizable as a security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, 
extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." Any doubt as to whether access 
to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security. <EM>See</EM> Enclosure 2 to the Directive, Section 
E2.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I 
conclude the following with respect to guidelines C and B:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline C is based on actions taken by an individual which indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States. Applicant's renewal of his 
Russian passport and his refusal to relinquish this current passport raises serious foreign preference (Guideline C) concerns. They are a clear violation of the 
oney Memorandum, and therefore Applicant is absolutely barred from retaining a security clearance. Applicant's stated unwillingness to renounce his 
Russian citizenship must also be considered adversely to Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, 
influence or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. Disqualifying condition E2.A2.1.2.1., an immediate family member, or 
a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country, must be considered in 
assessing Applicant's current suitability for access to classified information. Applicant's mother and maternal grandparents, who still reside in Russia, and with 
whom he has weekly telephone conversations, are a great risk of being in a position to be exploited by a foreign power. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The security concerns engendered by the foreign citizenship and/or residency of such close family members may be mitigated where it can be determined that 
the immediate family member(s), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a 
way that could force an individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States (E2.A2.1.3.1.) Applicant's wife and father, who 
reside in the United States, are far less of a threat. I do not consider his relatives in Israel to be a threat either.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Formal Findings as required by Section 3. Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 to the Directive are hereby rendered as follows:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Paragraph 1. Guideline B:  AGAINST THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P>
