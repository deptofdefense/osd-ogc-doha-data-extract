<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on March 24, 2003.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="02-03042.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over finances (Guideline F) in paragraph 1, alcohol issues (Guideline G) in paragraph 2, 
illegal drug issues (Guideline H) in paragraph 3; criminal conduct (Guidelilne J) in paragraph 4, and personal conduct (Guideline E) in paragraph 5. Applicant 
responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on April 14, 2003, where he requested a decision be made without a formal hearing.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel on July 25, 2003, prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) for the Applicant's review and advised Applicant that he had 30 days to 
submit objections and/or information before the FORM was submitted to an administrative judge and that he had the right to be represented by counsel.  A 
Personnel Security Specialist (PSS) sent the FORM to Applicant on July 25, 2003, and again notified the Applicant that he had 30 days from receipt of the letter 
to submit objections and/or information before the FORM was submitted to an administrative judge. Applicant received the FORM on August 20, 2003, with a 
response due on September 19,  2003.  The Applicant submitted no response.  The DOHA Director assigned the case to me for a decision on the record on 
October 3, 2003. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant, 38 years old, has worked for a defense contractor in State #1 since 1983.  He married in 1989 and was legally separated in March 1999; he has three 
children.   To be upgraded to a Department of Defense (DoD) confidential clearance, he completed a National Agency Check Security Information form in 
October 1999.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Finances</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant admits that he owes eleven of the fifteen debts alleged in the SOR which total over $25,000; I accept his denial of the debts to creditors alleged in 
SOR 1.e., 1.f., 1.g<A HREF="02-03042.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>. and 1.k.even though  previously in a sworn statement to the Defense Security Service (DSS) Applicant admitted two of the four debts, 1.f. 
and 1.k.   In August 2001 Applicant admitted that his financial situation was in "a bad state" as he did not have the means to pay his debts because his 
household and living expenses consumed his monthly salary.  At the same time, he disclosed in a Personal Financial Statement in August 2001 that he had a net 
monthly remainder of $200 per month after expenses which he did not use toward resolving his debts.  His net monthly income was approximately $1,400 per 
month, expenses were approximately $1,200; he made no monthly debt payments.  While he claimed that many of his financial problems relate to his prior 
marriage and child support obligations, he did not explain why he remained unable to pay these bills.  He provided no information as to how he was reformed 
his financial practices or that he has received or is receiving counseling for his financial problems.  He failed to respond to the FORM and provide an updated 
Personal Financial Statement. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant started drinking when he was 14 or 15 years old, and has continued to drink despite a series of Drinking While Intoxicated (DWI) arrests and 
convictions in 1989, 1994, and 1996.  Further, in 2000 he was held in contempt of court after he appeared for a child support motion with a strong odor of 
alcohol on his breath and was ordered to spend 24 hours in jail.  He attributes these incidents to "bad luck" and has not seen them as an indication of a drinking 
problem even though he was in a treatment program in 1998 where he was diagnosed with polysubstance abuse and advised to stop drinking alcohol.  On the 
first day back to work after treatment, Applicant had  alcohol on his breath and was sent home until March 1999.  In August 2001 he admitted he was drinking 
one pint of liquor per week and one quart of beer, mostly on weekends. In April 2003 Applicant denied he was still drinking at this level, but he provided no 
evidence of how he has reduced on his consumption of alcohol or of his commitment to sobriety. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Abuse and</STRONG> <STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted in August 2001 that he first smoked marijuana while in high school in the late 1970's and last smoked marijuana in fall 1998; he smoked 
marijuana two times per week for the entire time he used it and bought marijuana about twenty per cent of the time; he never sold marijuana.  He first used 
cocaine in 1988 and used it about four to six times a year, but never purchased cocaine.  While on probation, he tested positive for cocaine in May 1998 and 
received a verbal warning from his probation officer.  In August 1998 Applicant failed a drug test administered by his employer when he tested positive for 
marijuana and cocaine.  His job was jeopardized by his use of marijuana and cocaine, so the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) referred him to an intensive 
drug counseling program where he was diagnosed with polysubstance dependence.  In March 1999 Applicant was assessed with substance abuse issues; the 
counselor recommended in May 1999 that Applicant attend long term substance abuse counseling.  He attended a 30-day outpatient program and subsequently 
returned to work. However, he has provided no information as to how he was reformed and whether or not he continues to use drugs or has made a commitment 
to abstinence.  He failed to respond to the FORM.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>As discussed above, Applicant showed poor judgment in 2000 when he appeared for a child support motion with a strong odor of alcohol on his breath and was 
held in contempt of court.  In August 1998 he failed his drug test by testing positive for marijuana and cocaine.  Further, when Applicant applied for a security 
clearance in October 1999, he failed to disclose on the form in answer to Question 34 that he had financial issues and a wage garnishment in 1996 to satisfy his 
child support obligation.  In April 2001 Applicant admitted to DSS that many of his other debts were also not disclosed on his security form.   Although he 
answered "No" to Question 27 concerning his illegal use of drugs in the past seven years when he failed to disclose his use of marijuana and cocaine until 1998, 
Applicant established in his April 2001 DSS interview that he had no intent to falsify as he had disclosed this drug use in Answer to Question 26 where he 
revealed his positive drug test for marijuana and cocaine at his work place.  He had no intent to falsify Question 27.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a 
consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Guideline F - Financial Considerations </STRONG></CENTER>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or

doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Security concerns persist over Applicant's (1) history of financial problems and his (3)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy all of his debts. He failed to show 
sufficient efforts to resolve these debts as the majority of his debts to a dozen creditors remained unresolved:  he provided no documentary evidence of his 
having resolved his multiple debts which total over $25,000.  Clearly, Applicant has not made managing his finances a priority.  Nor has he documented that 
under MC 4 that he has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.  
For example, he provided no current budget.  Thus security concerns persist because of  long-standing nature of these debts, and his failure to resolve them. As 
Applicant denied his debts to four creditors, I conclude Applicant has made some progress and give him credit for resolving these debts even where the record 
is not totally clear with respect to the debts detailed in SOR 1.e., 1.f., 1.g. and 1.k.  Applicant mitigated<A HREF="02-03042.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> some of his debts under mitigating condition (MC) 6 
as he initiated a good faith effort to repay those overdue creditors.   After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I 
conclude that he has mitigated the allegations in SOR subparagraphs1.e., 1.f., 1.g. and 1.k., but failed to mitigate 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.f., 1.h., 1.i., 1.j, 1.l., 1.m., 
1.n., and 1.o.   I rule against Applicant under SOR Paragraph 1. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government established security concerns over Applicant's past alcohol abuse as he has a history of drinking to excess and has had multiple alcohol-related 
incidents in 1989, 1994, and 1996, as well as an incident where he was found in contempt of court in 2000 for appearing in court with the strong odor of alcohol 
on his breath.  Even after he attended an alcohol treatment program, Applicant returned to work with the odor of alcohol on him and was sent home.  There is  
evidence in the record that he was diagnosed with an alcohol abuse problem, and he admited his rehabilitation program advised him not to drink any alcohol.  
Thus, Applicant's conduct falls within DC 1, 2, and 5.  While these problems occurred a number of years ago, Applicant has not provided evidence to 
demonstrate that he falls within any of the mitigating conditions.<A HREF="02-03042.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Although in his Answer to the SOR he denied drinking at his past levels, he failed to 
provide persuasive evidence of his current sobriety or that there is no indication of a recent problem.  After considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process 
factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraphs 2.a. though 2.f. under SOR Paragraph 2.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Use</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government established security concerns over Applicant's long term marijuana use and cocaine use which led him to fail a drug test at work in August 
1998.  Further, he admitted he tested positive for cocaine use in May 1998 while he was on probation and was issued a warning by his probation officer.  
Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: 1.  Any drug abuse and 2. Illegal drug possession, including purchase.   
Applicant  failed to mitigate<A HREF="02-03042.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> his  past drug abuse as he provided no evidence that he has reformed his lifestyle nor that he has made a convincing commitment 
to avoid all future drug use.  Further, he provided no positive work record.  Thus, after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraphs 3.a., 3.b., 3.c., and 3.d., incorporated under SOR Paragraph 3.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government established security concerns over his criminal conduct as related to his drug use, SOR 3.b., 3.c., and 3.d., as discussed above.   Conditions 
that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: a. allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was 
formally charged; and b. a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.  As discussed above, Applicant provided no evidence that he has reformed<A HREF="02-03042.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> his 
conduct. Consequently,  after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraphs 4.a. 
incorporated under SOR Paragraph 4.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Also, the Government established security concerns over personal conduct issues:  Applicant showed poor judgment both in 2000 when he  was held in 
contempt of court after he appeared for a child support motion with a strong odor of alcohol on his breath and in August 1998 when he failed his drug test by 
testing positive for marijuana and cocaine.  Further, when Applicant applied for a security clearance in October 1999, Applicant failed to reveal his wage 
garnishment on his security form. Applicant's omission of relevant and material information about this debt could reflect questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that he may not properly safeguard classified 
information.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant overcame the Government's security concerns over his failure to answer "Yes" to Question 27 because in answer to Question 26 he  revealed his 
positive drug tests for marijuana and cocaine use; thus, he has mitigated<A HREF="02-03042.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN> this concern as this explanation is credible.  </P> 
 
<P>However, other personal conduct concerns are not mitigated as there is no evidence that Applicant  made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omissions 
before being confronted with the facts.  Further, Applicant provided no recommendations about his character.  After looking at the whole person and 
considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraph 5.a. and 5.b. under SOR Paragraph 5, 
but for him under 5.c.</P>
