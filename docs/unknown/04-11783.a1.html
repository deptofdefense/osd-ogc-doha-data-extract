  Given the record, the challenged findings under SOR paragraph 2.a. are permissible characterizations by the Judge.  However, the Judge erred with regard to 2.b.   The Judge's error is harmless.  The Judge's conclusion that Applicant's false statements were deliberate is sustainable.  The security significance of an applicant's conduct or circumstances does not turn on the  applicant's technical abilities.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On September 28, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the 
basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) 
(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April 26, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Darlene Lokey Anderson denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant 
timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.<A HREF="04-11783.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's findings are supported by substantial evidence; whether the Administrative Judge erred in concluding 
Applicant's falsification of his security clearance application was deliberate; whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines E is arbitrary, capricious, or 
contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(1) Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge's findings that Applicant had a foreign employment, business, or financial interest that was required to be disclosed in response to questions 6 and 
12 on his security clearance application are not supported by substantial evidence.  Applicant's </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">argument has mixed merit.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record. Directive &para; E3.1.32.1. "This 
is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's finding from being 
supported by substantial evidence." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm'n</EM>, 383 U.S. 607, 620, (1966). In evaluating the Administrative Judge's finding, we are required to give deference to the 
Administrative Judge's credibility determinations. Directive &para; E3.1.32.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this case, there was record evidence that Applicant had a contract for the production of a film in Russia.  According to the contract, Applicant was a second owner of the production company and 
was hired by the movie's financial investor to oversee the principal owner's activities in producing the film and to protect the investor's interests.  This investor was to be repaid $52,500 and receive 
30% of the profits from the movie.<A HREF="04-11783.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  In furtherance of the contract, Applicant had traveled to Russia with the principal owner to be the investor's personal representative from approximately 
December 2001 through February 2002, and again from approximately October 2002 through December 2002.<A HREF="04-11783.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant completed his security clearance application in March 2003, less than 
three months after his second return from Russia.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Given the record in this case, the findings with respect to SOR &para; 2.a., which Applicant challenges, are permissible characterizations by the Administrative Judge.<A HREF="04-11783.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Applicant has not met his burden 
of demonstrating that the Judge's material findings with respect to Applicant's conduct of security concern do not reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  In that 
regard, the Board concludes that the Judge's material findings with respect to SOR&para; 2.a.  are based upon substantial evidence and are sustainable.<A HREF="04-11783.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">However, with regard to SOR &para; 2.b. (Question 12 on the Security Clearance Application), the Judge's finding that Applicant provided a false answer when he answered "no" to the question asking 
him about his foreign property, business connections or financial interests is not sustainable based on the evidence of record.  That evidence establishes that Applicant had a business interest in the 
production of a Russian movie that lasted until December 2002, inasmuch as he had traveled to Russia to oversee its production until that time.  Applicant testified that the movie project was 
cancelled.  There is no additional record evidence to indicate precisely when the project was cancelled and there is no evidence to establish either a business/ownership or an employment connection 
between Applicant and the movie production after December 2002.  Question 12 on Applicant's March 25, 2003 Security Clearance Application is couched purely in the present tense.  It asks, "Do 
you have any foreign property, business connections, or financial interests?"  Given Applicant's denial of the SOR allegation, the burden of proof was on Department Counsel to establish the 
falsification.  A prerequisite to establishing the falsification was establishing that Applicant's "No" answer to Question 12 was incorrect, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>i.e.</EM>, he had a foreign business or financial interest of some 
kind on March 25, 2003.  Department Counsel failed to do this.  Thus, there is no basis in the record evidence for the Judge's finding of falsification relating to SOR &para; 2.b.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Because the Administrative Judge's other two findings of falsification are reasonably supported by the record evidence and are sufficient to sustain her overall adverse security clearance decision, 
the Judge's error with regard to SOR &para; 2.b. is harmless.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(2) Applicant argues that he did not deliberately falsify his Security Clearance Application by failing to disclose the 1998 bankruptcy filing and that his leaving the bankruptcy question blank was 
not evidence of an intent to falsify.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Administrative Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant's explanation for why he left the question blank and failed to disclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as 
a matter of law, to accept or reject Applicant's explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant's explanation in light of the record evidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to 
find that Applicant's omissions were deliberate and intentional.  Accordingly, we sustain the Judge's findings of deliberate, intentional falsification.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.32.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(3) Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision under Guideline E is arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law because Applicant's fluency in two languages is important to 
the nation's defense effort.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The federal government has a compelling interest in protecting classified information and, pursuant to that interest, it has to decide whether persons to be entrusted with access to classified 
information are at risk of deliberately or inadvertently mishandling such information.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of Navy v. Egan,</EM> 484 U.S. 518, 528-529 (1988).  In making such decisions, the federal 
government must determine whether a given person possesses and exhibits the high degree of judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of persons granted access to classified information.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-22325 at 3 (App. Bd. July 30, 2004).  Security decisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's job performance or conduct during duty hours, and off-duty 
conduct can be relevant in assessing an applicant's security eligibility.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>01-20445 at 4 (Apr. 29, 2003).  An applicant's technical expertise (or lack thereof) is not a measure of whether the 
applicant is at risk of deliberately or inadvertently mishandling classified information, nor is it a measure of whether the applicant demonstrates the high degree of judgment, reliability, or 
trustworthiness required of persons granted access to classified information.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 8 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  The security significance of Applicant's conduct and 
circumstances does not turn on whether Applicant possesses a technical ability that could be useful to a Department contract or project.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 03-04090 at 7 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 
2005).  Moreover, the security concerns raised by Applicant's conduct under Guideline E are not extenuated or mitigated by whether Applicant possesses a technical ability that could be useful to a 
Department contract or project.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A review of the decision indicates that the Administrative Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the 
possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge found in favor of the Applicant under Guideline B.  However, the Judge articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying any 
mitigating conditions or whole-person factors under Guideline E, and reasonably explained why the evidence Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government's 
security concerns.  Given the record that was before her, the Judge's unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline E is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
