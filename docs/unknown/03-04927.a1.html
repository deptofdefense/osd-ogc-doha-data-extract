  Applicant's pro se status did not relieve her of the obligation to take timely, reasonable steps to protect her rights under Executive Order 10865 and the Directive.  Having decided to represent herself during the proceedings below, Applicant cannot fairly complain about the  quality of her self-representation or seek to be relieved of the consequences of her decision to represent herself.  The Administrative Judge's  finding that Applicant falsified a security clearance application reflects a legally permissible interpretation of the record evidence.  The  Judge's findings about Applicant's falsification and her history of financial difficulties provide a rational basis for his unfavorable  conclusions about her security eligibility.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated December 8, 2003, which 
stated the reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe issued an unfavorable security 
clearance decision, dated October 26, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether Applicant was denied a fair hearing because she was not properly represented; 
(2) whether the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that Applicant intended to falsify her security clearance application; (3) whether the 
Administrative Judge erred in concluding that Applicant had a history of not meeting her financial obligations and is unable or unwilling to 
satisfy her debts; (4) whether the Administrative Judge erred in not granting or continuing Applicant's security clearance because she needed 
it to retain her employment; and (5) whether the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Applicant was a security risk was arbitrary, capricious 
or contrary to law based on her past record.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine 
whether there is factual or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with 
specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with 
specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or 
capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or 
conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant 
evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the 
choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it 
offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere 
difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the 
Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, 
the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are 
conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of 
fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary 
evidence in the same record.  In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the 
Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is 
record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence 
supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a 
Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on 
appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at 
pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  
<EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether Applicant was denied a fair hearing because she was not properly represented</SPAN>.  Applicant contends that she "unknowingly" went 
into the hearing without  representation because she did not understand the severity of the matter.  Not appreciating the severity of the matter, 
Applicant suggests she was no match for the "very serious and prepared professionals" who represented the government. </P> 
 
<P>The record shows that Applicant was advised in paragraph 1 of the Prehearing Guidance that the hearing would be adversarial and that 
normally the government would be represented by an attorney who would present the government's case.  The Prehearing Guidance also 
advised Applicant that she could represent herself, retain an attorney at her own expense to represent her at the hearing, or select a Personal 
Representative to represent her at the hearing.   Applicant's testimony indicates she received the Prehearing Guidance (attached to the Notice 
of Hearing), but she did not read it (Hearing Transcript at p. 37).  Additionally, in a May 12, 2004, letter to Applicant, the Department 
Counsel advised Applicant on her representation choices and also stated: "[i]n making this decision you should consider that the Government 
is represented by an attorney and that any adverse determination could adversely affect your current employment and your future 
employability.  If you choose to be represented by an attorney, you should retain one promptly" (Government Exhibit 15 at p.1).  Applicant 
did not deny that she received this correspondence, but she testified that she did not read this portion of it (Hearing Transcript at p. 124). </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's <EM>pro</EM> <EM>se</EM> status did not relieve her of the obligation to read the correspondence sent to her regarding her hearing and to take timely, 
reasonable steps to protect her rights under Executive Order 10865 and the Directive.  Having decided to represent herself during the 
proceedings below, Applicant cannot fairly complain about the quality of her self-representation or seek to be relieved of the consequences of 
her decision to represent herself.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-08032 (May 14, 2004) at p. 4.  Accordingly, this claim of error lacks merit. </P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that Applicant intended to falsify her security clearance application</SPAN>.  Applicant 
disputed SOR paragraphs 2.a through 2.d, which stated that she falsified her responses to questions 33 (bankruptcy filings in the past seven 
years), 37 (unpaid judgments in the past seven years), 38 (delinquent debts over 180 days old in the past seven years) and 39 (currently 
delinquent in any debt over 90 days) in her July 2002 Security Clearance Application (SF-86).  The Administrative Judge found that 
Department Counsel had introduced substantial evidence on each of the allegations in paragraph 2 (Decision at p. 6).  Applicant did not 
introduce any documentary evidence to rebut the government's case, but she testified that she did not intend to falsify her responses in the SF-86.  The Administrative Judge then questioned the Applicant at the hearing and compared her testimony with her own prior written statements 
that were included in the government's exhibits.  The record evidence included Applicant's testimony that she was very familiar with the SF-86 because her employment duties included assisting other employees in completing their SF-86 questionnaires (Hearing Transcript at p. 44).  </P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge had to consider Applicant's testimony that she did not falsify her responses to the four questions, but he was not 
bound to accept that testimony.  The Judge had to consider Applicant's explanation in light of the record evidence as a whole and his 
assessment of the credibility of Applicant's testimony, and make findings as to whether Applicant's omissions of information from the SF-86 
were deliberate or not.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-28447 (September 29, 2004) at pp. 3-4.  Giving due deference to the Judge's credibility 
determinations, the Judge's finding of falsification reflects a legally permissible interpretation of the record evidence in this case.</P> 
 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that Applicant had a history of not meeting her financial obligations and is unable or 
unwilling to satisfy her debts</SPAN>.  Applicant contends that she did not know who was garnishing her wages, and that she got a "run around" when 
she tried to find out.  Applicant contends that she never knew what her net wages would be.   Applicant assumed that if her pay was being 
garnished by creditors, then she was not delinquent on her debts (Decision at p. 2).  The Board construes Applicant's appeal as raising the 
issue of whether the Judge erred in concluding that she had a history of not meeting her financial obligations or that she was unable or 
unwilling to satisfy her debts under Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions 1<A HREF="03-04927.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>and 3.<A HREF="03-04927.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The Judge had to consider the record evidence, both favorable and unfavorable, and determine whether the favorable evidence outweighed the 
unfavorable, or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  In her appeal Applicant references the debts that involved garnishment.  The delinquent debts also included 
admitted delinquent debts where no garnishment was involved and denied debts where Applicant failed to pay or actively contest the 
indebtedness.  Applicant professes confusion or ignorance of the details concerning those creditors who had garnished her salary.  Given the 
record evidence, the Judge could have reasonably concluded that Applicant had not made any efforts to pay her delinquent debts, or to get her 
finances in order, and that Applicant fell within the scope of the two disqualifying factors (Decision at p. 6).  Also, given the record evidence, 
the Judge could have reasonably concluded that Applicant's testimony was not credible in so far as she testified that she reasonably believed 
that the garnishments were paying her debts and made them current. </P> 
 
<P>4. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in not granting or continuing Applicant's security clearance because she needed it to retain her 
employment</SPAN>.  Applicant describes the potentially negative effects that losing her security clearance could have, such as possible job loss and 
its consequences for her family.  Even if an unfavorable security clearance decision were to have an adverse effect on Applicant's 
employment situation, such a result would not demonstrate the Administrative Judge's decision was arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  
An applicant is not made more or less suitable for a security clearance based on how a security clearance decision might affect the applicant.  
The negative security significance of Applicant's history of not meeting her financial obligations or the falsification of her SF-86 is not 
reduced or diminished by the possibility that an unfavorable  security clearance decision might adversely affect her employment.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 01-24504 (February 11, 2003) at p. 4.</P> 
 
<P>5. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Applicant was a security risk was arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law based on her 
past record</SPAN>.  Applicant contends that even though she did not make sound personal financial decisions, her background shows that she would 
never risk national security.  She argues that her financial decisions and national security are "two separate entities."  She describes the 
clearances she has held in the past, including some clearances that were higher than top secret. </P> 
 
<P>Prior security clearance adjudications and the granting of clearances for Applicant have no bearing on the legal sufficiency of the 
Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision here.  The government is not estopped from making an adverse clearance decision 
when there were prior favorable adjudications.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-24504 (February 11, 2003) at p. 3.</P> 
 
<P>Moreover, security clearance decisions are not an exact science, but are predictive judgments about a person's security eligibility in light of 
that person's past conduct and present circumstances.  <EM>See Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528-529 (1988).  The federal 
government need not wait until an applicant mishandles or fails to properly handle or safeguard classified information before it can deny or 
revoke access.  <EM>See</EM> <EM>Adams v. Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238-39 (D.C. Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  The government does not 
have to prove that an applicant poses a "clear and present danger" to national security.  <EM>See Smith v. Schlesinger</EM>, 513 F.2d 462, 476 n.48 
(D.C. Cir. 1975).  Under Guideline F, the security eligibility of an applicant is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a 
history of not meeting financial obligations or inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.  <EM>Cf.</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0596 (October 4, 2001) at p. 
4 (a decision where Applicant was found to be a security risk notwithstanding his prior security clearance, good past military record and years 
of employment in the defense industry).  Similarly, falsification of a security clearance application is a clear example of untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of 
persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security clearance decision.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15.  Given the 
record evidence in this case, it was not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law for the Administrative Judge to conclude that the Applicant 
failed to meet this burden of persuasion in light of her unresolved delinquent debts and falsification of the security clearance application. </P>
