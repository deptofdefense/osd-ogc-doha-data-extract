<P>	Administrative Judge Robert R. Gales issued a decision, dated August 22, 1996, in which
he concluded it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
clearance for Applicant.  Department Counsel appealed.  For the reasons set forth below, the
Board reverses the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>	This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992.</P>

<P>	Department Counsel's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the
Administrative Judge erred by failing to apply collateral estoppel to Applicant's arguments
concerning his conviction on two state felony counts; (2) whether the Administrative Judge's
ruling that Applicant's sexual misconduct was isolated is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law;
(3) whether the Administrative Judge erred by failing to explain his deviation from pertinent
Adjudication Policy factors; (4) whether the Administrative Judge erred by refusing to consider a
Certified Results of Interview; (5) whether the Administrative Judge erred by considering only a
portion of a Report of Investigation offered by Applicant; and (6) whether the Administrative
Judge erred by finding for Applicant under Criterion H with respect to one of the allegations of
sexual misconduct.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons
(SOR) dated November 24, 1995.  The SOR was based on Criterion H (dishonest and/or criminal
conduct), Criterion Q (sexual misconduct), and Criterion I (poor judgment, unreliability, or
untrustworthiness).</P>

<P>	Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR, in which he indicated "I elect to have a
decision without a hearing."  Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM),
a copy of which was sent to Applicant.  Department Counsel objected to portions of Applicant's
response to the FORM.</P>

<P>	The Administrative Judge subsequently issued a written decision in which he concluded
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant.  The case is before the Board on Department Counsel's appeal from that favorable
decision.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG><A HREF="95-0817.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	1.  <U>Whether the Administrative Judge erred by failing to apply collateral estoppel to
Applicant's arguments concerning his conviction on two state felony counts</U>.  The Administrative
Judge found that "a critical analysis of the SOR does not reveal any allegation that Applicant
had, in fact, committed any criminal conduct," but he then notes that Applicant pleaded guilty to
two felony counts of engaging in lewd, lascivious, or indecent acts in 1993-1994 with
Applicant's eldest stepdaughter, a minor teenager at the time.  The Judge went on to discuss the
record evidence and conclude, among other things, that: (a) Applicant pressed his stepdaughter's
hand on his exposed penis, on one occasion, which was interpreted and charged as forced or
enticed masturbation under count III; and (b) Applicant rubbed her chest/breast area when
innocently applying lotion, conduct which was interpreted and charged as fondling under count
II.  With regard to count II, the Judge also found that "Applicant's motivation regarding the
count II conduct (touching or rubbing his stepdaughter's breasts) was the innocent intent of a
parent to apply lotion to a child's body, and was not performed in a lewd, lascivious, or indecent
manner."  On appeal, Department Counsel contends the Judge erred by not applying the doctrine
of collateral estoppel to Applicant's arguments of innocence concerning his conviction on two
state felony counts.  For the reasons that follow, the Board finds Department Counsel's
contention persuasive.</P>

<P>	Once the Administrative Judge found that Applicant was convicted of two felony counts
of engaging in sexual misconduct with Applicant's stepdaughter, the Judge should have applied
the principle of comity and not analyzed the Applicant's conduct underlying the two felony
counts.  While he couched his discussion in terms of the Directive's factors under Section F.3 of
and the Mitigating Factors under Criminal Conduct (extenuation, or circumstances indicating
that the actual offense was less serious than the offense charged), the Judge's decision suggests
that he did not accept as fact the conduct of the Applicant which  supported an essential element
of the crime in each count.  Granting the Judge the benefit of any doubt that his consideration of
the Applicant's count III conduct was mitigation, his comments on count II cannot be interpreted
as mitigation.  In count II the Judge found that the conduct there involved the "innocent"
application of suntan lotion and that the Applicant had "not performed in a lewd, lascivious, or
indecent manner." Thus, the Judge collaterally attacked the State Court's finding that the
Applicant violated an essential element of the offense of fondling a child under 16 in a lewd,
lascivious, or indecent manner, i.e., <U>knowing</U> commission of a lewd or lascivious act that the
child saw or sensed.  While the Administrative Judge has discretion in applying the mitigating
and F.3 factors under the Directive, he erred, as a matter of law, in allowing the Applicant to
recant his admission of criminal intent with respect to count II.</P>

<P>	The Board has held that the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies in these proceedings
and precludes applicants from contending they did not engage in the criminal acts for which they
were convicted.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 94-1213 (June 7, 1996) at p. 4 ("Although Applicant had
the right to offer evidence in extenuation or mitigation of his felony criminal conduct, he was not
at liberty to seek to relitigate the issue of his guilt of the crime for which he was convicted.");
DISCR Case No. 88-2271 (October 16, 1991) at p. 5 ("Applicant's conviction collaterally estops
him from challenging, in these proceedings, the validity of his conviction or his guilt of the
offenses for which he was convicted); DISCR Case No. 88-2903 (February 13, 1990) at p. 4
(applicant convicted of felony in state court does not have right to relitigate issue of his guilt of
that offense in industrial security clearance proceeding).  The Board has recognized that there are
some exceptions to this general rule.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 94-1213 (June 7, 1996) at pp. 3-4.  One
notable exception involves convictions where an Applicant plead <EM>nolo</EM> <EM>contendere</EM> instead of
guilty, but none of those exceptions are present in this case.<A HREF="95-0817.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  Moreover, the circumstances which
resulted in the finding of reversible error by the Administrative Judge in ISCR Case No. 94-1213
are very similar to the ones involved here.  Accordingly, it was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary
to law for the Judge to conclude the Applicant's conduct related to count II was innocent or that
he had not committed or performed in a lewd, lascivious, or indecent manner.</P>

<P> </P>

<P>	Applicant's guilty plea to the two felony counts constituted an admission that he engaged
in the acts covered by the charges to which he pleaded guilty.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 93-0369
(October 26, 1994) at p. 3.  The fact that the Administrative Judge felt "the record contains no
meaningful direct evidence of what had occurred to lead to his charges and eventual plea" is
legally irrelevant.  By ignoring the plain legal significance of Applicant's conviction, especially
with regard to count II, and expressing dissatisfaction with the probative value of other
information in the record, the Judge was impermissibly holding Department Counsel to a higher
standard of proof than required under the Directive.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 94-1055 (May 8, 1996)
at p. 3 ("Nothing in the Directive requires Department Counsel to prove its case against an
applicant through any specific form of evidence."); DISCR Case No. 87-0390 (June 6, 1991) at
pp. 3-4 (Administrative Judge erred by requiring Department Counsel to offer specific forms of
proof in SOR allegations).</P>

<P>	The Board cannot uphold the Administrative Judge's favorable findings and conclusions
to the extent they are predicated on his analysis that goes behind Applicant's conviction on
sexual misconduct with Applicant's eldest stepdaughter and seek to conclude Applicant did not
engage in the conduct covered by those convictions.</P>

<P>	2.  <U>Whether the Administrative Judge's ruling that Applicant's sexual misconduct was
isolated is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</U>.  The Administrative Judge characterized
Applicant's sexual misconduct with his biological daughter and several years later with his eldest
stepdaughter as being "isolated in nature."  Department Counsel contends that conclusion is
arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Department Counsel's contention has merit.</P>

<P>	The record evidence shows Applicant engaged in sexual misconduct with his then-minor
biological daughter on several occasions over a period of two to three months in 1985, and in
sexual misconduct with his minor eldest stepdaughter in 1993-1994.  Given that record evidence,
it was arbitrary and capricious for the Administrative Judge to characterize Applicant's sexual
misconduct as being "isolated in nature."  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 94-1213 (June 7, 1996) at p.
4 (arbitrary and capricious for Administrative Judge to view an applicant's conduct in a
piecemeal fashion and conclude some of it was "isolated" conduct).  The Judge's conclusion
does not reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence and cannot be
affirmed on appeal.</P>

<P>	3.  <U>Whether the Administrative Judge erred by failing to explain his deviation from
pertinent Adjudication Policy factors</U>.  Department Counsel contends the Administrative Judge
erred by applying Sexual Misconduct Mitigating Factor 2<A HREF="95-0817.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> and Sexual Misconduct Mitigating
Factor 4.<A HREF="95-0817.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>  Department Counsel argues the Judge's application of those factors was error because
it involved an impermissible deviation from the plain meaning of those factors.  Those arguments
are persuasive.</P>

<P>	An Administrative Judge must apply pertinent Adjudication Policy factors for and against
clearance.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 95-0731 (September 13, 1996) at p. 4.  The Adjudication
Policy permits an adjudicator to deviate from the plain terms of the Adjudication Policy factors,
but only under limited circumstances: "Common sense may occasionally necessitate deviations
from this policy guidance, but such deviations should not be frequently made and must be
carefully explained and documented."  Accordingly, a Judge does not have unfettered discretion
in applying Adjudication Policy factors.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 95-0578 (October 2, 1996) at
p. 6 ("A Judge does not have unfettered discretion in deviating from the terms of pertinent
Adjudication Policy factors.").</P>

<P>	As discussed earlier in this decision, it was arbitrary and capricious for the Administrative
Judge to characterize Applicant's sexual misconduct as being "isolated in nature."  Moreover,
Applicant's sexual misconduct with his eldest stepdaughter occurred during the period
November 1993-June 1994, which was within three years of the close of the record below. 
Accordingly, the Judge had no reasonable basis for his application of Sexual Misconduct
itigating Factor 2 without an explanation for deviating from its plain meaning.</P>

<P>	The Administrative Judge recognized that Applicant was still on probation for his 1994
sexual misconduct convictions and was still undergoing required psychiatric treatment/mental
health counseling for sex offender treatment. Yet despite this, the Judge applied Sexual
isconduct Mitigating Factor 4.  Considering the record as a whole, the Judge could not
reasonably apply Mitigating Factor 4 without a detailed explanation for doing so.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR
Case No. 94-0164 (January 19, 1995) at p. 4 ("Where the deviations are minor or trivial, a simple
explanation may be sufficient.  Where the deviations are major or substantial, a more detailed
explanation should be provided.").  The Judge's single reference to Sexual Misconduct
itigating Factor 4 fails to satisfy the requirement that he explain deviations from it.</P>

<P>	4.  <U>Whether the Administrative Judge erred by refusing to consider a Certified Results of
Interview</U>.  Included in the FORM was a document prepared by a special agent of the Defense
Investigative Service (DIS) on July 5, 1995 to summarize the agent's interview of Applicant on
June 6, 1995 (FORM Item 5).  The Administrative Judge ruled that the document was "nothing
more than a written, un-notarized, statement adverse to the Applicant on a controverted issue
which may only be received and considered by me without affording an opportunity to cross-examine when justified by the circumstances only as specified in the Directive at Enclosure 3,
Item 22.  I am unaware of any such compliance with the provisions of the Directive. 
Accordingly, to maintain a fundamental fairness, I have chosen not to consider the document."</P>

<P>	On appeal, Department Counsel contends the Administrative Judge erred by refusing to
consider FORM Item 5.  In support of this contention, Department Counsel argues: (a) Applicant
did not object to FORM Item 5 and he commented favorably on its accuracy;<A HREF="95-0817.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> (b) the Judge's
refusal to consider FORM Item 5 violated his obligation under Directive, Section F.3. to consider
all available information, both favorable and unfavorable; (c) FORM Item 5 is admissible under
Rule 803(6) of the Federal Rules of Evidence; and (d) the Judge's reliance on Item 22 of the
Additional Procedural Guidance was misplaced because FORM Item 5 does not consist of
statements made against Applicant by third-parties.  For the reasons that follow, the Board
concludes the Judge erred by refusing to consider FORM Item 5.</P>

<P>	When Applicant responded to the FORM he asserted "many critical pieces of information
contained in the [FORM] runs (sic) the gamut from being patently untrue to extremely
exaggerated."  Furthermore, Applicant's response set forth his specific disagreements with and
characterizations of various portions of the FORM as being "untruth's" or "extremely
exaggerated."  Nowhere in Applicant's energetic criticisms of various portions of the FORM
does he challenge the completeness, accuracy, or truthfulness of FORM Item 5 or any portion of
it.<A HREF="95-0817.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	The Administrative Judge's analysis of FORM Item 5 was flawed because Item 22 of the
Additional Procedural Guidance of the Directive is inapplicable here.  Item 22 states that the
Administrative Judge cannot consider a written or oral statement adverse to Applicant on a
controverted issue unless the Applicant has an <U>opportunity</U> to cross-examine the person making
the statement, except when certain national security considerations (not applicable here) apply. 
As Department Counsel points out, Item 22 is directed at statements made against an applicant
by third parties.  FORM Item 5, on the other hand, involved the Applicant's own admissions
against interest made to an agent of the Defense Investigative Service.  Item 22 assures an
applicant that he will not suffer from an adverse statement made by someone who can make
himself unavailable for cross-examination (with certain narrow exceptions).  If there had been a
hearing, we have no reason to assume the agent would have been unable to testify.  FORM Item
5 is otherwise admissible under Rule 803(6) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.  The Judge's
action was a violation of his responsibility under Section F.3. of the Directive to consider all
available information, both favorable and unfavorable.<A HREF="95-0817.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	5. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge erred by considering only a portion of a Report of
Investigation offered by Applicant</U>.  In response to the FORM, Applicant submitted several
documents, including a ROI dated July 6, 1995.  After receiving Applicant's response to the
FORM, Department Counsel objected to the admissibility of the ROI and argued, in the
alternative, that the Administrative Judge should receive an entire copy of the ROI instead of the
partial copy submitted by Applicant.<A HREF="95-0817.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A>  The Judge ruled that Applicant's <EM>pro se</EM> status raised a
question whether his submission of a partial copy of the ROI constituted a knowing and
intelligent waiver of his rights against the admissibility of ROIs under Executive Order 10865
and the Directive.</P>

<P>	On appeal, Department Counsel contends the Administrative Judge erred because: (a) the
Applicant's submission of a partial copy of the ROI presented a misleading impression of the
entire document that required admission of a complete copy to ensure fairness under the
principles of Rule 106 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE 106); and (b) the Judge's ruling
constituted an abuse of discretion because it was inconsistent with his obligation under the
Directive to develop a full and complete record.</P>

<P>	Here, Applicant submitted a partial copy of an ROI for consideration by the
Administrative Judge.  However, no party has the right to insist that only portions of a document
the party submits be considered by a Judge.  When a party submits a partial copy of a document,
that party assumes the risk that the other party will ask that a complete copy of the document be
submitted for consideration by the Judge.  The principle of fairness underlying FRE 106 is a very
important one that benefits all parties in these proceedings, including the Government. 
oreover, the Judge noted that the FRE only serves as a guide in these proceedings, but the last
sentence of Item 20 is more specific - it directs that an ROI may be received into evidence
"provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence . . ." and it is
authenticated.  The Judge should have excluded the ROI in its entirety, not admitting only that
portion that favored Applicant.  <EM>Cf</EM>. DISCR Case No. 89-1327 (January 23, 1991) at pp. 6-8
(Administrative Judge erred by not striking and disregarding testimony of an applicant's witness
when claim of privilege precluded Department Counsel from cross-examining witness). </P>

<P>	6.  <U>Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding for Applicant under Criterion H
with respect to one of the allegations of sexual misconduct</U>.  SOR &para;1.b. alleged that Applicant's
sexual misconduct with his biological daughter in 1985 constituted criminal conduct under
Criterion H.  The Administrative Judge entered a formal finding for Applicant on that allegation
because it did not cite any criminal statute and Applicant was not arrested or charged in
connection with that conduct.  Department Counsel contends the Judge's favorable finding on
that SOR allegation is in error because: (a) it is contrary to common sense for the Judge to
determine that Applicant's conduct was not criminal in the state where it occurred; and (b) the
Judge should have taken administrative or official notice of the pertinent state criminal statute. 
In its brief, Department Counsel properly acknowledges that its position on this issue runs
contrary to a prior Board ruling and asks that the Board reconsider its ruling in that case and
reverse it.  For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes Department Counsel has failed to
demonstrate harmful error.</P>

<P>	In ruling on SOR &para;1.b., the Administrative Judge erred by relying on the fact that
Applicant had not been arrested or charged in connection with his 1985 sexual misconduct with
his biological daughter.  The Board has repeatedly held that an applicant can be shown to have
engaged in criminal conduct even if the applicant was never charged or convicted.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,
ISCR Case No. 94-1213 (June 7, 1996) at pp. 4-5; DISCR Case No. 93-1186 (January 6, 1995) at
p. 7.  Accordingly, the fact that Applicant had not been arrested or charged in connection with his
1985 sexual misconduct is not dispositive of the issue.</P>

<P>	Moreover, the Administrative Judge erred, in part, by relying on the fact that SOR &para;1.b.
did not cite a specific criminal statute.  An SOR is an administrative pleading that should not be
held to the strict standards of a criminal indictment.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 94-1213 (January
16, 1996) at p. 6.  Even a technically deficient SOR allegation is not fatal to the Government's
case if an applicant is placed on reasonable notice of the nature of the conduct the Government
meant to be covered by an SOR allegation and has a reasonable opportunity to respond to the
allegation and present evidence to address it.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 94-0841 (February 8,
1996) at p. 3.  However, when submitting the FORM, Department Counsel did not present any
evidence (<EM>e.g</EM>., copy of state criminal statute or state court decision holding that conduct in
question was a common law crime in the jurisdiction where it occurred) to support SOR &para;1.b.,
nor did Department Counsel ask the Judge to take administrative or official notice of any such
statute or state court decision.</P>

<P>	Although the Administrative Judge gave erroneous legal reasons for entering a formal
finding  for Applicant with respect to SOR &para;1.b., Department Counsel has failed to demonstrate
the Judge's error was harmful in nature.  As Department Counsel concedes, the Board has ruled
contrary to its position on this issue in the past.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, DISCR Case No. 92-0711 (July 14,
1993) at p. 4.  Nothing in Department Counsel's brief persuades the Board to overrule its
previously ruling.  Indeed, if the Board were to accept Department Counsel's arguments, it
would require the Board to conclude that Administrative Judges must act as surrogate advocates
for Department Counsel and fill in gaps in the Government's case.  The Board declines to reach
such a result.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Department Counsel has met its burden on appeal of demonstrating reversible error. 
Pursuant to its authority under Item 33 of the Additional Procedural Guidance, the Board
reverses the Administrative Judge's August 22, 1996 decision.</P>

<P>	I don't believe that reversal is justified here.  This case should be remanded to the
Administrative Judge to re-apply Mitigating Factor 4.  There is documentation in the record from
a Ph. D. asserting that he believes that Applicant has progressed quickly, is not a threat to the
national security and will complete therapy this year.  The Administrative Judge needs to apply
the terms of Mitigating Factor 4 to all the pertinent information in this case and if he concludes
that deviation is appropriate he needs to explain it properly.  Even the Applicant's version of his
conduct would make it difficult to deviate in his favor.  Applicant acknowledges his "role-reversal" with his biological child (that is, treating her like his wife) and he "let" his step-child
touch him twice, once for 10-15 seconds and once he "pressed her hand on it."</P>
