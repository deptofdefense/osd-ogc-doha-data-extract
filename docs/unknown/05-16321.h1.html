<P>Applicant has approximately $18,774 in delinquent debt. Most of his financial problems were caused by circumstances beyond his control. They include a 12 month period of under employment, 
and becoming the sole provider of a new wife and three stepdaughters at the same time. Applicant's past history of holding a security clearance during a 14 year military career and his demonstrated 
efforts to resolve his debts mitigated the security concern raised under financial considerations.  Clearance is granted.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On June 6, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">July 23, 2006</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on August 16, 2006.  A notice of hearing was issued on 
September 11, 2006, scheduling the hearing for October 3, 2006. The hearing was conducted on that date. The government submitted five exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (Gov 
Ex) 1-5, and admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his behalf, and submitted nine exhibits which were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-I and admitted without objection. The 
record was held open and Applicant timely submitted a 12 page post-hearing submission which was marked as AE J, and admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 
October 11, 2006.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his SOR response, Applicant admits to the allegations under Guideline F, &para;&para; 1.b -1.e, 1.g, 1.k, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.r.  He denies the allegations in &para;&para; 1.a, 1.f, 1.h - 1.j, 1.l, 1.n, 1.p, 1,q, and 1.s.  
Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN>Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance. He is a ground systems engineer and has been employed with his current company since July 
2006. He was an employee of a subcontractor working for the company the previous three years.  He takes college courses on-line.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He is married.  He and his wife are raising her three daughters 
from a prior marriage, ages 17, 15, and 13.  They also have a four year old son.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant has two adult sons from a previous marriage, ages 20 and 22.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>From September 28, 1988, to January 14, 2002, Applicant served on active duty in the United States Army.  He separated from active duty at the rank of Staff Sergeant, E-6. He was an intelligence 
specialist.  He decided to separate from the military when he and his current wife decided to marry.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>When he separated from the military, Applicant went to work for a defense contractor. Soon after, he learned his mother had cancer.  He went to visit her.  Unfortunately, she passed away before he 
got there.  He paid expenses towards her funeral and clearing up her estate.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Upon his return to work, he had difficulty concentrating since he was still mourning the loss of his mother.  He was 
terminated within a month of his return in August 2002.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Around this same time period, Applicant married his wife on August 17, 2002. His wife's ex-husband provides little to no child support so Applicant is the principal provider for the family.  His 
wife works part-time as a dance instructor.  Applicant was unemployed from August 2002 to September 2003. He worked some temporary jobs, such as temporary holiday work, but it was not 
enough to pay all of the bills. <A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Many of the accounts went delinquent.</P> 
 
<P>In July 2003, Applicant found full-time employment.  On February 2, 2005, he submitted a security clearance application.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  He disclosed his financial problems on the security clearance 
application.  A subsequent background investigation disclosed the following delinquent debts: a $555 credit card account charged off in September 1998 (SOR &para; 1.a); a $1,386 account placed for 
collection in October 2001 (SOR &para; 1.b); a $3,124 account placed for collection in November 2001 (SOR &para; 1.c); a $11,883 account placed for collection in April 2002 (SOR &para; 1.d); a $68 cell phone 
account placed for collection in June 2002 (SOR &para; 1.e); a $218 cable account placed for collection in August 2002 (SOR &para; 1.f); a $248 dental bill delinquent since 2002 (SOR &para; 1.g); a $109 account 
charged off in November 2002 (SOR &para; 1.h); a $509 account placed for collection in September 2003 (SOR &para; 1.i); a $43.45 account placed for collection in September 2003 (SOR &para; 1.j); a $331 
phone or cell phone account placed for collection in November 2004 (SOR &para; 1.k); a $183.04 account placed for collection in November 2004 (SOR &para; 1.l); a $105 medical account placed for 
collection in November 2004 (SOR &para; 1.m); a $105 medical account placed for collection in December 2004 (SOR &para; 1.n); a $218 cable bill placed for collection in April 2005 (SOR &para; 1.o); a $12.86 
medical account delinquent since May 2005 (SOR &para; 1.p); a $100 delinquent loan (SOR &para; 1.p); a $106.63 delinquent medical account (SOR &para; 1.r); and a $8,342 collection account (SOR &para; 1.s).<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></P>

</P> 
<P>In October 2006, Applicant consolidated his three largest bills. His monthly payments towards the consolidation plan will be $395.08.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> He would have consolidated the three bills earlier but when 
he started his new job, they underpaid him $200 each paycheck. The pay issue is now resolved.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> He did not include the bills with lower balances in the consolidation because he is confident that he 
will be able to pay off these bills within 90 days.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's financial situation is improving. He and his wife have a budget. His budget indicates that there is $113 left over each week after expenses.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> In addition, his wife works on a steady basis 
in the fall and winter. She brings in approximately $400 a month. He also expects that his wife's ex-husband will soon start making child support payments of $800 a month.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> He has paid off five 
of the lesser accounts. He intends to pay three additional accounts by the end of November and one by the end of December. Five of the accounts are duplicates of other accounts as described in the 
table above. I find for Applicant with regards to SOR &para; 1.s.  I find credible Applicant's explanation that this was a duplicate account of SOR &para; 1.d. There is nothing in the record evidence that 
suggests otherwise. In fact, there is nothing in the record evidence verifying the alleged debt. He is actively working on the remaining two accounts by either disputing the account or attempting to 
arrange a payment plan.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  He also provided evidence of other debts that were resolved which were not alleged in the SOR.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has worked for the government for the past 20 years either in the military or as a  contractor. He has always believed his job is important and would not do anything to jeopardize his 
country, family, or job.  He and his wife are striving to resolve their debts.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>   </P> 
 
<P>The Assistant Area Director of Applicant's former employer wrote a letter on his behalf. She has known him since 2002.  She was impressed with his professionalism.  He has always been 
responsive and helpful and has always exceeded expectations of his managers. She trusts his judgment and would not hesitate to rely on him with important matters.  She would hire him back if 
given the opportunity.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> A close friend, who he served with in the Army, states he has known Applicant for nine years.  He notes that he always found ways to "get the job done, get it done right, 
and ensure all actions were legal and ethical." He has the utmost faith in his personal ethics and professionalism.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> His current supervisor states Applicant has "always displayed the utmost integrity 
and has proven to be an extremely trustworthy employee." He personally requested that his company hire him from the subcontractor he worked for based on these characteristics.<A HREF="05-16321.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Guideline F- Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guideline F, the government established its case. Applicant has a history of financial problems. Since 2002, he has incurred over $18,774 in delinquent debts. His financial problems 
support the application of  Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (A<EM> history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>); and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>Inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>).<EM></EM></P> 
 
<P>Several conditions could mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant's financial delinquencies.  Neither Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC  MC) E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The behavior 
was not recent</EM>)<EM>; </EM>or FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>It was an isolated incident</EM>)<EM> </EM>applies.  Applicant just recently began to resolve his debts.  His financial troubles cannot be described as an isolated incident 
since he has incurred approximately 14 delinquent debts.    </P> 
 
<P>  Much of Applicant's financial problems were caused by incidents that were beyond his control.  As such, FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the 
person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)</EM>),<EM> </EM>applies.  Applicant had to deal with the death of his mother, the 
loss of his full-time job, a new marriage, and the added responsibilities of being a stepfather to three children within a short period of time.  Aside from some temporary jobs which did not pay well, 
he was unemployed from August 2002 to July 2003. The family finances were further complicated by his wife's ex-husband's failure to provide child support for his three daughters.  Applicant's 
financial problems were primarily caused by several factors beyond his control that unfortunately occurred during the same time period.  I find FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 applies.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 <EM>(The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) </EM>applies as well.  Applicant initiated a good faith effort to repay his overdue 
debts as soon as he was able. He consolidated three of his largest debts. He has resolved four of the debts.  He intends to pay off three additional debts by the end of November and another debt by 
the end of December. Five of the accounts are duplicates of other accounts. He is actively working towards resolving the other two accounts. He demonstrated a good faith effort to resolve his debts.  
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised under Guideline F. Guideline F is decided for Applicant.    <STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Whole Person Factors</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I considered all the evidence provided and also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant's financial 
problems  were caused, in part, by factors beyond his control.  Now that his financial situation has improved, he is actively attempting to resolve his debts. He and his wife have established a 
budget. Although not all of Applicant's delinquent debts are resolved, I found his character references particularly compelling.  They each noted he is a reliable and trustworthy person.  I also 
considered Applicant's hearing testimony, and his 14 year history of holding a security clearance while serving in the military. The security concerns under financial considerations have been 
mitigated. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. </P>
