<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated July 8, 2003 which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  Administrative 
Judge James A. Young issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated November 17, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by not concluding Applicant's criminal conduct was mitigated 
under Guideline J; and (2) whether the Board should recommend this case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).  For the reasons that 
follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision and does not recommend that this case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. 
&sect;986(d).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by not concluding Applicant's criminal conduct was mitigated under Guideline J</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge found 
that: (a) in March 2000 Applicant was convicted of two counts of forgery and a count of obtaining money by false pretenses; (b) Applicant was sentenced to 
incarceration for two years on each of the three counts; (c) the entire sentence of incarceration was suspended; and (d) Applicant completed his probation and 
made court-ordered restitution.</P> 
 
<P>Although Applicant does not challenge the Administrative Judge's findings about his conviction, Applicant contends he presented sufficient evidence of 
mitigation to warrant favorable formal findings under Guideline J.  Applicant's specific arguments in support of his contention set forth an alternate 
interpretation of the record.  However, Applicant's ability to argue for an alternate interpretation of the record evidence is not sufficient to show that the Judge's 
conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Given the record evidence in this case, the Judge's adverse conclusions under Guideline J are not 
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge had a rational basis for concluding Applicant's criminal conduct was serious, reflected adversely on his 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, and had not been mitigated under Guideline J.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Board should recommend this case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d)</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge concluded that 
Applicant's conviction in March 2000 falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986<A HREF="02-11547.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and declined to recommend a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).<A HREF="02-11547.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Applicant does not 
challenge the Judge's conclusion that his conviction falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, but does contend that there is record evidence of sufficient mitigation to 
support a recommendation that he be granted a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).</P> 
 
<P>In a June 7, 2001 memorandum implementing the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, the Deputy Secretary of Defense indicated: "The decision as to whether a 
particular case involves a meritorious case that would justify pursuing a request for waiver shall be the province of the DoD Component concerned (i.e. all 
Components authorized to grant, deny or revoke access to classified information) beginning with the Director of the Component Central Adjudication Facility 
(CAF), the Component appellate authority or other appropriate senior Component official."  For purposes of the June 7, 2001 memorandum, the Director, 
DOHA is the Director of the Component Central Adjudication Facility for industrial security clearance cases.</P> 
 
<P>To implement the June 7, 2001 memorandum, the Director, DOHA issued an operating instruction (dated July 10, 2001) which indicates the following:</P> 
 
<P>"Administrative Judges are responsible for initial resolution as to whether or not 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of the case."  (Operating Instruction, 
paragraph 2.e.)</P> 
 
<P>"In the event of an appeal raising an issue as to the applicability of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board is responsible for final resolution of the issue."  (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 2.f.)</P> 
 
<P>"In the event of a final determination that 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of a case, the Director is solely responsible for the discretionary decision as to 
whether to recommend to the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) that 10 U.S.C. 986 should be waived by the Secretary of Defense."  (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 2.g.)</P> 
 
<P>"If an Administrative Judge issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Administrative Judge shall include 
without explanation either the statement 'I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'I do not recommend further 
consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'"  (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.e.)</P> 
 
<P>"If the Appeal Board issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board shall include without explanation 
either the statement 'The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'The Appeal Board does not recommend 
consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'" (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.f.)</P> 
 
<P>"In any case in which [the] Administrative Judge, or [the] Appeal Board in the event of an appeal, recommends consideration of a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986, the 
Director shall within his sole discretion determine whether or not to forward the case to the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) for further consideration 
of a possible waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986 by the Secretary of Defense together with such rationale as may be requested by the Deputy General Counsel (Legal 
Counsel)."  (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.g.)</P> 
 
<P>The Operating Instruction does not authorize the Board to review an Administrative Judge's recommendation whether or not a waiver should be considered.  
Furthermore, under the Operating Instruction, the Board is not authorized to give reasons or an explanation for its decision to recommend or not recommend 
that a waiver be considered, but only state without explanation either: (1) "The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 
986" or (2) "The Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986."  Since the Board is asked to make a 
recommendation in its own capacity, the Board is not bound by the recommendation made by the Judge below and must review the record evidence as a whole 
in order to fulfill its obligation to make a meaningful decision whether to recommend that a waiver should or should not be considered.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusions</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to meet his burden on appeal of demonstrating error by the Administrative Judge.  The Administrative Judge's November 17, 2003 
decision is affirmed.  Furthermore, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's conclusion that 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 precluded him from making a favorable 
security clearance decision in Applicant's case.</P> 
 
<P>Under the Operating Instruction the Board cannot address the specific arguments asserted in Applicant's request that the Board recommend his case be 
considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).  The Board reaches this conclusion for the following reasons: (1) the Board does not have the authority to 
review an Administrative Judge's recommendation whether an Applicant's case should be considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d); and (2) the Board 
is precluded from giving an explanation for its own recommendation concerning waiver.  Recognizing the limits of its authority under the Operating Instruction, 
the Board has reviewed the record evidence as a whole and states the following: The Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver 
of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P>
