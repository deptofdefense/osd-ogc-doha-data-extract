<P>Applicant is an aircraft structural mechanic for a defense contractor.  In the same year he retired after 20 years of active military duty, he was divorced from his 
wife, required to pay some of their bills, and give her half of his retired pay.  He has delinquent debts from credit cards used to pay for tools, appliances, and 
necessities both before and after the retirement and divorce.  He made no effort to pay the delinquent debts and has not mitigated security concerns under 
Guideline F.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On August 17, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a 
security clearance for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(February 20, 1990), 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (January 2, 1992), 
as amended and modified (Directive).  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 9, 2004.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline 
F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on September 20, 2004.  He admitted the allegations under Guideline F, but denied the alleged financial issues raised a 
security concern.  He elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.</P> 
<P>Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on February 22, 2005.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on 
arch 7, 2005, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  
Applicant's response to the FORM was received on March 18, 2005.  On April 28, 2005, Department Counsel noted no objection to the consideration of 
Applicant's response to the FORM.  The case was assigned to me on May 10, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 48-year-old aircraft structural mechanic for a defense contractor.  He retired from active military duty in 1998 after 20 years of service.  That 
same year,  he was divorced and required to pay credit card debts he and his wife incurred, pay the loans on both their cars, and to provide half of his retirement 
to his wife.  He has two grown children.</P> 
<P>Applicant's adult son, who lives with him, has a significant medical problem.  After his retirement and divorce, Applicant helped his son with his living 
expenses and medical bills.  Applicant no longer provides such support for the son since the son is now employed, has health insurance, and an agreement with 
drug companies to pay for some of his medications.  Applicant's daughter married after the divorce, and he helped her with wedding expenses.  Applicant was 
working for a defense contractor in September 2001, but worked less and his pay was reduced after the events of September 11, 2001.  Applicant only listed on 
his security clearance application two months of unemployment after retiring from active military service.<A HREF="03-19063.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">There are nine allegations of delinquent debts in the SOR totaling over $62,000.  Debt 1.a. in the SOR is a personal loan for $4,000 from a finance company.  
Applicant received this loan after his divorce to purchase necessities to live.  There have been no payments on this loan and the loan amount from penalties and 
interest is now over $8,000.  Debt 1.b. in the SOR is a delinquent credit card debt for $23,869 that Applicant and his former wife used before their divorce.  
Debt 1.c. in the SOR is a credit card debt for $641 that Applicant used after his divorce to buy tools and food.  Debt 1.d. in the SOR is a credit card debt for 
$7,500 that Applicant used for living expense after separating from his wife but before their divorce.  Debt 1.e. in the SOR is a department store credit card debt 
for $7,975 that Applicant used to buy tools for his job and appliances after his divorce.  Debt 1.f. in the SOR is a credit card debt for $8,602 placed in 
collection.  Applicant provided no information on the use of the card.  Debt 1.g. in the SOR alleges debt to a discount store for $2,571 used to purchase food for 
himself and gifts for his daughter.  Debt 1.h. in the SOR is a credit card debt for $2,794 that Applicant used to purchase tools and furniture after his divorce.  
Debt 1.i. in the SOR is a credit card debt for $359 that Applicant used to buy tires for his car.<A HREF="03-19063.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant intended to file a petition for discharge in bankruptcy but was unable to accumulate enough funds to pay the attorney and processing fees.  Applicant 
tried to have his debts managed by a credit counseling agency but their arrangements would not help Applicant to rapidly satisfy his debts.  There was no 
information presented by Applicant about any payments made for any of the above delinquent debts.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently 
trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."<A HREF="03-19063.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant 
meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.<A HREF="03-19063.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each guideline.  Each 
clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, 
and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable information about 
the person.<A HREF="03-19063.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to 
include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the  
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.<A HREF="03-19063.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="03-19063.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN>  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the 
Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible 
for access to classified information.<A HREF="03-19063.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Thereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-19063.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN>  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="03-19063.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN>  "[T]he Directive 
presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."<A HREF="03-19063.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN>  "Any 
doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." <A HREF="03-19063.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
<P>Guideline F - Financial Considerations: A security concern exists for an individual who is financially irresponsible.  An individual who is financially 
irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in 
one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the 
SOR.</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline F.  Applicant's delinquent debts brings the matter within Financial Considerations Disqualifying 
Conditions E2.A6.1.2.2 (<EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>); and E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>).  Applicant's delinquent 
debts arose before and after his divorce and retirement from active military duty.  Applicant and his wife incurred debts before their divorce and Applicant was 
assigned responsibility for the debts by the divorce decree.  The rest of the debts arose after the divorce from credit cards used by Applicant to buy items he 
needed for work and to live.  There is no information to suggest there have been any payments on these debts.  I conclude the above disqualifying conditions 
have been established.</P> 
<P>The Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions to consider for Applicant are  E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation</EM>); and E2.A6.1.3.6 
(<EM>the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>).  Applicant claims the debts rose because of conditions 
beyond his control, namely, his divorce, retirement from active military duty, expenses from his son's illness, and reduction of salary from the after effects of 
the events of September 11, 2001.  Applicant's debts did not arise because of any of these conditions but because he chose to incur debts when he did not have 
the financial resources to cover the debts.  He used credit cards and personal loans to purchase things he thought he needed or wanted.  There is no information 
Applicant changed his spending habits because of less income from his job, his divorce, and his retirement.  The use of credit cards and personal loans was 
within Applicant's control.  Applicant presented no information about paying any overdue creditors or otherwise resolving debts.  He tried a credit counseling 
agency to help resolve his indebtedness problems but did not follow through with them.  He mentioned that he would file bankruptcy, but presented no 
documentary information he has filed a petition in bankruptcy.  Applicant has not initiated a good-faith effort to pay his delinquent debts.  I conclude Applicant 
has not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations.</P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the "whole person' concept.  I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Formal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</P>
