<P>Thirty-eight year old Applicant's pattern of employer rule violations pertaining to the confidentiality and privacy of sensitive 
hospital patient information by wrongfully accessing computer files; his subsequent discharge for those actions; and the current

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 17, 2000, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>"Safeguarding 
Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6, <EM>"Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and 
modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn written statement, undated, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing.  The 
case was initially assigned to Administrative Judge John G. Metz, Jr., on December 7, 2000 but, due to caseload considerations, 
was subsequently reassigned to, and received by, this Administrative Judge on December 26, 2000.  A notice of hearing was 
issued on December 29, 2000, and the hearing was held before me on January 25, 2001.  During the course of the hearing, four 
Government exhibits and six Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of three Applicant witnesses (including Applicant), were 
received.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 13, 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted the sole factual allegation pertaining to personal conduct under Guideline E.  That admission is 
incorporated herein as a finding of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 38 year old male employed by a defense contractor, and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance, the level of 
which has not been described.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had previously been employed as a safety and security officer of a particular hospital from June 1989 until October 
1997.<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  He was 26 years of age at the time he commenced his employment.  At some point during that period, thought by 
Applicant to be during 1996-97,<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> a new computer system was installed in the hospital and Applicant was furnished with a key and 
password to access the system.<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  He was furnished with little, if any, instruction regarding computer use.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On at least three<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> different occasions during his period of employment, Applicant was furnished varying degrees of training 
regarding the confidentiality of medical information.  In June 1989, he signed an Employee Confidentiality Statement<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> in which 
he stated he understood and agreed that in the performance of his duties as an employee of the hospital he "must hold medical 
information in confidence."  In August 1995, Applicant signed a Certification in which he stated he had received and "thoroughly 
reviewed" the Corporate Compliance Plan.<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  The Corporate Compliance Manual contained the following language:<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Except as specifically authorized by the patient or by [employer hospital's] policies, no [employer hospital] employee shall:</SPAN></P> 
 
<UL> 
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Obtain medical information from a patient's record or from another employee if the employee obtaining the information does 
not need to know the information for purposes of providing care, performing medical quality review, submitting claims for 
reimbursement, or other authorized and appropriate purposes.</SPAN></LI> 
 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 1997, he signed another such statement<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> in which he stated he understood and agreed that in the performance of his duties 
as an employee of the hospital he "must hold medical, financial and personnel information in confidence."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Despite having read the hospital policy on confidentiality, in late 1996 or early 1997,<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> over the course of at least two or three 
months,<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Applicant accessed patient records in the system on an estimated 10 to 20 occasions.<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  In so doing, he pulled up the 
names of people whom he knew had their records on the system and viewed their files.<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  During this period, Applicant 
mentioned his computer system activities to a couple of people but never gave the matter much thought.  Finally, in about October 
1997, Applicant's supervisor became aware of Applicant's activities after a female employee reported that Applicant had viewed 
her medical file.<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  The supervisor approached Applicant regarding the alleged violation of hospital policy.  The matter was 
reported to Human Resources.  Applicant acknowledged "there was no professional or work related reason" for him to have access 
to the computer system.<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 29, 1997, Applicant was discharged from further employment for violation of the established hospital policy 
pertaining to confidentiality of patient information.<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  Applicant's subsequent request for reinstatement was denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's explanations for accessing the sensitive </SPAN>hospital patient information<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> were as follows: (1) since he worked mostly 
nights and did not have tasks to perform, he started to "mess" with the computers to improve his "computer knowledge;"<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> (2) he 
simply wanted to experiment with the computer and find out what he could do with it;<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> and (3) he wanted to improve his 
computer skills.<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  At the time of his computer activities, Applicant did not consider such actions to be a violation of hospital 
policy.<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  Applicant expressed regret over the policy violations and attributed his actions to ignorance and a lack of understanding, 
as well as, in retrospect, stupidity.<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> He also defended his actions by claiming that none of the accessed computer information was 
ever written down, printed, or otherwise disseminated to third parties.<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After his termination in October 1997, Applicant underwent a brief period of unemployment before securing his present security 
position with a government contractor.  Present and former co-workers and supervisors have favorably characterized his character 
and performance, using the following descriptions: personable, courteous, professional, dedicated, honest, trustworthy, and 
dependable.  He has generally met or exceeded the performance standards of his current and past positions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  
In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be 
considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying 
Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual's eligibility for access to classified 
information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative 
Process provision set forth in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the Directive, are intended to assist the Administrative Judge in 
reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful 
decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an Administrative Judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and 
seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of 
participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation 
of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>[Personal Conduct - Guideline E]: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly 
safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(5) A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the 
individual and the agency.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by 
applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="00-0291.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> or "clearly 
consistent with the national interest." For the purposes herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded that both 
standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have endeavored to draw only those conclusions that are reasonable, 
logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have attempted to avoid drawing inferences that are 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the Government to establish a case which 
demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an 
applicant's access to classified information.  If the Government meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon 
the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by 
the Government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust 
and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because 
of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible 
risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a 
certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance 
decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should 
be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness credibility, and after application of all appropriate 
legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each 
allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">With respect to Guideline E, the Government has established its case.  Examination of Applicant's actions reveals a pattern of 
conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, and unreliability.  There is little dispute surrounding Applicant's 
actions for he has admitted the essential elements of the repeated violations and been disciplined--and discharged--for them. 
Applicant accepted fiduciary responsibilities as a hospital safety and security officer, and was intrusted with keys and passwords to 
gain access to areas and computers, as necessary in the proper undertaking of his professional responsibilities.  Furthermore, on 
four separate occasions, he acknowledged he understood and agreed that in the performance of his duties as an employee of the 
hospital he would hold medical, financial and personnel information in confidence, consistent with</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> the hospital policy on 
confidentiality</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.  Nevertheless, Applicant repeatedly disregarded those known policy and procedures by wrongfully accessing 
sensitive medical information on the hospital computer system. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> overall questionable personal conduct in this regard 
clearly falls within Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A5.1.2.1. and DC E2.A5.1.2.5., cited above.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">While this matter is not alleged under Guideline M, Misuse of Information Technology Systems, I believe a brief discussion of 
that guideline under the facts herein could be constructive. The stated concern under that guideline is, in part: "Noncompliance 
with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns about 
an individual's trustworthiness, willingness and ability to properly protect classified systems, networks, and information."  One 
such condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying is: (1)  Illegal or unauthorized entry into any 
information technology system. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: (1) The misuse was not recent or 
significant; (2) The conduct was unintentional or inadvertent; and (4) The misuse was an isolated event.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">While the subject computer system involved only sensitive information and not classified information, the concern is identical.  
Applicant's repeated access to the system information may not have been "illegal," but it certainly was both unauthorized and in 
violation of established policy.  The potential mitigating conditions under this guideline do not apply.  It might conceivably be 
argued that Applicant's conduct was not "recent."  However, the term is not defined in the Executive Order, Regulation, or the 
Directive, and could, depending on differing circumstances, have various interpretations.  In this instance, I conclude that 
Applicant's 1996-97 conduct was, in relative terms, "recent"--</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">too recent to overlook.  The policy violations were significant 
enough to warrant Applicant's immediate termination by his employer.  The conduct was routine over a period of months and 
cannot be considered an isolated event.  And finally, the conduct by Applicant's admissions was intentional:  he started to "mess" 
with the computers to improve his computer knowledge</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and accessed sensitive computer information in an attempt to improve his 
computer skills</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.  Had Guideline M been alleged, Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> overall misuse of information technology systems in this regard 
would clearly fall within DC E2.A13.1.2.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past.  However, without a clear indication of subsequent 
reform, remorse, or rehabilitation, I am unable to determine with reasonable certainty the probability that such conduct will not 
recur in the future.  In this instance, Applicant has offered a variety of explanations for using knowledge, keys, and passwords 
intrusted to him for safekeeping and utilization under the appropriate circumstances.  He eventually expressed regret over the 
policy violations and attributed his actions to ignorance and a lack of understanding, as well as, in retrospect, stupidity. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> But he 
still seeks to exonerate his actions by claiming they did not result in the disclosure of sensitive information to others.  Aside from 
his brief acknowledgment that he had acted stupidly in 1996-97, the record is silent as to any indicia of rehabilitation and other 
positive behavioral changes.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I do not take this position lightly, but based on the law, as set forth in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of Navy v. Egan,</EM> 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my 
evaluation of the evidence, and my application of the pertinent factors and conditions under the Adjudicative Process, I believe 
Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the Government's case.  The evidence leaves me with grave questions and doubts as 
to Applicant's continued security eligibility and suitability.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Accordingly, allegation 1.a. of the SOR is concluded against 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of 
the Directive, are:</SPAN></P>
