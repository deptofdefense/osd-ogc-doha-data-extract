<P>Forty-five year old Applicant with a lengthy history of ignoring his financial obligations, and a tepid recent effort to address some of those obligations only after 
the security clearance review process commenced, raises grave questions and doubts as to his security eligibility and suitability.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On October 21, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated January 7, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing.  The case was initially 
assigned to Administrative Judge Matthew E. Malone on February 13, 2003, but due to caseload considerations, was reassigned to, and received by, this 
Administrative Judge on February 21, 2003.  A notice of hearing was issued on February 21, 2003, and the hearing was held before me on March 11, 2003.  
During the course of the hearing, six government exhibits, and seven Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of one Applicant witness (the Applicant), were 
received.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 18, 2003.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant has admitted all of the factual allegations pertaining to financial matters under Guideline F (subparagraphs 1.a.(1) through 1.a.(7)., and 1.b.).  Those 
admissions are incorporated herein as  findings of fact.</P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 45-year old employee of a defense contractor, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance.  He presently holds an interim security clearance.</P> 
<P>Applicant has seemingly been financially overextended since about 1996.  He had obtained several student loans from the U.S. Department of Education, 
initially totaling approximately $9,500.00, while attending a computer electronics school in 1995-96,<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> but when he commenced receiving correspondence 
related to repayment of the loans during 1996-97, he ignored those notices because he was "not in a position to repay it at the time."<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  As a result, each of the 
past due loans went into default and was placed for collection.  Eventually, a garnishment action was commenced.  Applicant subsequently agreed to have 
$50.00 per month garnished from his wages.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>The process continued undisturbed until about December 1998, when, without informing the creditor, Applicant left his position with his employer and took a 
job elsewhere.  The garnishment ceased at that point and no further effort was made by Applicant to either inform the creditor of his new status or make 
payments directly.  Finally, intending to purchase a new residence sometime in the future, in June 2001, Applicant decided it was time to repair his credit 
standing and approached the creditor to do so.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  In July 2001, the loans were consolidated and an extended repayment plan was set up with the creditor.  The 
plan called for monthly payments of approximately $97.00 commencing in August 2001.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The total principal balance outstanding was $9,488.42,<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> and when 
the final expected payment was to be made in July 2013, the total payments would be approximately $14,000.00.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  In October 2001, Applicant indicated an 
intent to remain current and satisfy the obligation in its entirety.</P> 
<P>The repayment plan requiring monthly payments of approximately $97.00 remained in place until about December 2001, when a Reduced Payment Forbearance 
lowering the monthly payment to $65.00 was activated.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In May 1997, Applicant purchased a 1994 pre-owned motor vehicle for over $26,000.00 and financed the transaction with a loan requiring monthly payments of 
$444.00.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Following a haphazard payment history, and with the account becoming increasingly delinquent, in about August 2001, the vehicle was 
involuntarily repossessed.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  At the time the vehicle was repossessed, but before it was auctioned, Applicant anticipated owing an unpaid balance of 
approximately $5,500.00, which he declared he intended to satisfy.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Despite his best intentions, Applicant ignored the notices from the creditor,<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> and, until 
August 2002, when prompted by interrogatories from DOHA, made no effort to enter into a payment plan.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  That superficial effort was followed by 
Applicant's continued inaction, inaction which continues until the closing of the record,<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> despite entreaties from the creditor to respond to an offer to make 
suitable payment arrangements.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  The outstanding balance as of November 6, 2002 was $9,574.35.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  That amount has now increased to approximately 
$9,800.00.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In February 2001, a nationwide telecommunications company referred Applicant's past-due unpaid account, in the amount of $146.00, for long distance service, 
to a collection agency.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  Applicant admits the debt,<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> but disputes the basis for it by contending he never had long distance service furnished by the 
creditor.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  As he did with the auto loan, Applicant made no effort to resolve  or even openly dispute the obligation until prompted to do so in August 2002 
when he received interrogatories from DOHA.  He sent one letter to the creditor at that time and, without identifying any account number, asked the creditor to 
search its records for any outstanding account that Applicant might owe the creditor and establish a repayment schedule.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  To this day, the <EM>status quo </EM>remains 
unchanged.</P> 
<P>In February 1999, an emergency care provider referred Applicant's past-due unpaid account, in the amount of $134.00, for professional services previously 
rendered, to a collection agency.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  Applicant admitted this was one of the debts he had "ignored over the years."<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  Finally, in August 2002, upon receipt of 
the DOHA interrogatories, Applicant wrote the creditor and indicated a desire to establish a repayment schedule.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  Such a schedule was eventually agreed 
upon and, according to Applicant, he has been making monthly payments of $25.00 since October 2002.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  With an acknowledged balance of $84.00 as of 
December 16, 2002,<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> Applicant now claims he is "current."<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  He has no documentation to support his contention that his monthly payments have been made 
on schedule.</P> 
<P>In December 1997, a hospital referred Applicant's past-due unpaid account, in the amount of $111.00, for professional services previously rendered, to a 
collection agency.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  Applicant included this debt with those other obligations which he said he had "ignored over the years."<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  In August 2002, upon receipt 
of the DOHA interrogatories, Applicant wrote the creditor and indicated a desire to establish a repayment schedule.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  No such agreement took place until five 
months later when Applicant agreed to make his initial installment payment of $27.82 on January 16, 2003.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  Applicant acknowledged he did not make his 
first installment payment as he had hoped,<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> and offered no explanation for his failure to follow through with his promise.</P> 
<P>In May 2000, Applicant opened a credit card account with a bank and the balance owed on the account rapidly climbed.  His payments were chronically late, 
and he was 90 or more days past due on four occasions before the account was eventually charged off as a bad debt and referred to collection.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A>  Applicant 
made no effort to resolve this indebtedness until prompted to do so in August 2002 when he received the interrogatories from DOHA.  He sent a letter to the 
creditor and indicated a desire to establish a repayment schedule.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>  Such a schedule was eventually agreed upon and, according to Applicant, he has been 
making monthly payments of $25.00 since October 2002.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A>  The past due balance, as of December 12, 2002, was $575.00,<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A> and as of December 16, 2002, 
was $559.49.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In June 1999, a national retailer referred Applicant's past-due unpaid account, in the amount of $213.00, for unspecified materials previously received, to a 
collection agency.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A>  Applicant included this debt with those other obligations which he said he had "ignored over the years."<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A>  In August 2002, upon receipt 
of the DOHA interrogatories, Applicant wrote the creditor and indicated a desire to establish a repayment schedule.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A>  No such agreement took place and to 
this day, Applicant took no further actions to resolve the debt and the <EM>status quo </EM>remains unchanged.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>On August 31, 1998, Applicant issued a check to a county government, in the amount of $75.00, presumably for parking.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A>  The check was returned unpaid 
with the notation the payment was refused because of insufficient funds.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A>  The creditor informed Applicant he had 30 days from the mailing of the notice to 
pay the County Attorney's Office sufficient money to pay such check in full and a collection fee of $25.00 for a total amount of $100.00.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A>  He failed to comply 
with the notice, and was subsequently informed the new liability was recalculated to $250.00.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A>  On June 7, 2002, a Writ of Summons was filed in court 
establishing a court date of August 28, 2002.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A>  On that date, Applicant failed to appear, but instead sent a letter to the County Attorney acknowledging the 
debt and seeking a repayment plan.  As a good faith gesture, he enclosed a check for $25.00.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A>  An "Affidavit Judgment" was subsequently entered in favor of 
the county.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A>  He has since made payment arrangements to resolve the matter.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_49_"><SUP> (49)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Aside from the debts appearing in the SOR, Applicant's current finances are in disarray and he still has a number of unpaid financial obligations.  He is behind 
in his federal income tax payments for the years 1997-2001, and owes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) approximately $10,000.00 due to insufficient 
withholding caused by his claiming too many dependents.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_50_"><SUP> (50)</SUP></A>  While he claims to have approached the IRS to establish a payment plan, no arrangements have 
yet been discussed.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_51_"><SUP> (51)</SUP></A>  Likewise, Applicant owes state income taxes for an unspecified period, but he has made no effort to contact the state authorities.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_52_"><SUP> (52)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In addition, Applicant's one remaining bank credit card, although previously past due, is once again current, but admittedly near its maximum limit.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_53_"><SUP> (53)</SUP></A>  His 
gasoline credit card was also past due, but is now merely "maxed out," and he is making minimum monthly payments.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_54_"><SUP> (54)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant has acknowledged searching for consumer counseling services, and has conceded being told to bring in his bills for assistance in consolidating 
them.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_55_"><SUP> (55)</SUP></A>  He has not yet done so.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_56_"><SUP> (56)</SUP></A>  Instead, he is waiting until April 2003 to enroll in a five-week general counseling course, and has not requested direct 
consumer counseling.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_57_"><SUP> (57)</SUP></A>  Also, he has requested this security clearance review process be delayed for six months to enable him to clean up his outstanding 
debts.<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_58_"><SUP> (58)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant married and divorced the same woman on two different occasions, and he currently has a 14-year old son residing with him.</P> 
<P>A network tech analyst with his company since October 1999, Applicant's 2002 technical annual performance review rated him as "outstanding" - the highest 
level of five different categories, and he has been characterized as a "lynch-pin" of his company's performance in a particular area.</P> 
<P>Applicant served on active duty with the United States Marine Corps from February 1975 until September 1979, and received an honorable discharge.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
<P>An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the 
Directive, are intended to assist the Administrative Judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
Administrative Judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
<P><STRONG>[Guideline F - Financial Considerations]: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P> 
<P>(1) a history of not meeting financial obligations;</P> 
<P>(3) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</P> 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P> 
<P>(3) the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business turndown, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation);</P> 
<P>(6) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</P> 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="01-25853.h1.html#N_59_"><SUP> (59)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest." For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have endeavored to draw only 
those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have attempted to avoid drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the Government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the Government meets 
its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to 
overcome the doubts raised by the Government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the Government must be 
able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and 
conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">With respect to Guideline F, the Government has established its case.  Applicant's financial difficulties, attributed to his marital discord and responsibilities as a 
single parent, were exacerbated by his lengthy periods of ignoring correspondence from creditors and a refusal to attend to his finances.  As a result, he incurred 
too many consumer debts and fell behind in his monthly payments.  Eventually he stopped making payments altogether.  As a result, various creditors either 
charged off their losses, transferred or sold the accounts, repossessed a motor vehicle, or referred the overdue accounts to collection.  And, he issued a bad 
check to a county government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">It is significant that Applicant's motivation to periodically address his debts was rather parochial.  When, in July 2001, he decided to clean up his defaulted 
education loans, it was because he felt he needed a scrubbed credit record to purchase a new residence.  Fiscal responsibility or moral obligation were not even 
remote considerations.  In October 2001, he declared his intention to resolve all his outstanding financial obligations, yet as of July 2002, his inaction remained 
undisturbed.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Despite being aware of his debts, as well as there being official interest in them, he took no action to resolve any of them until he received the DOHA 
interrogatories.  Applicant's efforts have been superficial at best, and, in reality, seem to be nothing more than promises made and broken, accompanied by 
requests for more time.  It was only after the security clearance review process commenced that he was finally motivated to take </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>some</EM> action with regard to 
some of his debts.  Thus, his conduct pertaining to his financial obligations falls within Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A6.1.2.1., 
and DC E2.A6.1.2.3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's marital discord and divorce - some of the conditions attributed by him to be the causes of his financial problems - fall within Financial 
Considerations Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A6.1.3.3.  Additionally, although he was largely unmotivated by the security clearance review process to take 
meaningful corrective action, and preferred to ignore his outstanding debts as long as he could, at least for three outstanding debts, he purportedly did enter into 
repayment agreements and commence making periodic payments to reduce the outstanding balances.  Nevertheless, Applicant is sending mixed signals.  On a 
sliding scale of good faith efforts, Applicant's efforts to repay the three overdue creditors would appear to fall within MC E2.A6.1.3.6.  His overall failure, 
however, to address the remaining outstanding debts over such a lengthy period, despite the appearance of motivating benchmarks, minimizes the significance 
of the brief evidence of positive action.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's finances are presently still not in good shape--although it is a marked improvement over their status during his lengthy period of financial 
mismanagement.  His actions with regard to those outstanding debts, his refusal to honor those financial commitments despite voluntarily entering into them, all 
support the conclusion a financial problem continues to exist.  Moreover, his continuing problem is not primarily the result of a condition beyond his control.  
And, it does not appear he is able to keep his head above water with his new debts.  Under these circumstances, I believe Applicant has failed to mitigate or 
overcome the Government's case, for the evidence leaves me with grave questions and doubts as to Applicant's continued security eligibility and suitability 
with respect to his financial considerations.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a.(2), 1.a.(3), 1.a.(5), 1.a.(7), and 1.b., of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On the other hand, with respect to the other three delinquencies--those on which he has entered into payment arrangements and already made substantial efforts 
at reducing those balances, I conclude that Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the 
Government's case.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a.(1), 1.a.(4), and 1.a.(6), of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
