</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On December 27, 2004, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="03-24531.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="03-24531.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 
January 28, 2005,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and February 8, 2005, and requested her case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on March 7, 2005.  The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 13.  By letter dated March 9, 2005, a copy of the FORM 
was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM 
and filed her response by letter dated April 7, 2005.  Department Counsel did not object to Applicant's submission.  On May 11, 2005, the case was assigned to 
me for a decision. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains nine allegations of disqualifying conduct charged under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and six allegations charged under Guideline 
E, Personal Conduct.  In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all fifteen allegations.  Her admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 66-year-old data technician employed by a defense contractor.  Applicant and her husband have been married since November 1959.  They are 
the parents of two adult children.  (Item 5.)  Applicant has held a security clearance for 20 years and needs a clearance to do her job.  (Response to Form, at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed and certified an application for a security clearance (SF-86) on January 23, 2002.  Question 36 on the SF-86 reads: "In the last 7 years, 
have you had a lien placed against your property for failing to pay taxes and other debts?"  Applicant answered "no" to Question 36.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of financial problems.  She owed federal taxes, interest and penalties for tax years 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000, and 2001.  
(Items 11.)  These debts had not been paid as of July 21, 2003 and totaled approximately $27,812.37.  Notices of federal tax liens were filed against Applicant 
on December 29, 1995 for the federal tax delinquencies of 1992 and 1993.  Notices of federal tax liens were filed against Applicant on March 30, 2001 for her 
federal tax delinquencies of 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998.  Applicant owed state taxes, interest, and penalties for tax years 1988, 1989, and 1990, which, as of 
July 21, 2003, had not been satisfied and which totaled approximately $1,657.54.  Applicant had three county tax liens placed against her in1997, one country 
tax lien placed against her in 1998, and one county tax lien placed against her in 1999.  These liens totaled approximately $2,448.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In June 2004, Applicant negotiated an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to pay</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">$550 per month on her federal tax liabilities.  Her first monthly installment was due August 28, 2004.  (Item 3, at 7-8.)  Applicant's five county tax liens were 
released January 10, 2000.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's concern under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, is that individuals who are financially overextended and unable or unwilling to pay 
their just debts may try to generate funds by engaging in illegal acts.  Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations, and this financial history 
suggests an inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts, conditions which raise security concerns under subparagraphs E2.A6.1.2.1. and E2.A6.1.2.3. of 
Guideline F.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  By evading her responsibility to pay federal income taxes and state and county taxes, she has raised a security concern under subparagraph 
E2.A6.1.2.2. of Guideline F.  DOHA's Appeal Board has concluded that "[a] person who is unwilling to fulfill his legal obligations does not demonstrate the 
high degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons granted access to classified information."  ISCR Case No. 98-0810 at 4 (App. Bd. June 8, 
2000).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged that Applicant owed the Internal Revenue Service approximately $3,811.24 in taxes, penalties, and interest for tax year 1992, that a 
notice of federal tax lien was filed against her December 29, 1995, for non-payment of the federal tax debt, and, that, as of July 21, 2003, the debt had not been 
satisfied (&para; 1.a.); that she owed the Internal Revenue Service approximately $5,088.72 in taxes, penalties, and interest for tax year 1993, that a notice of federal 
tax lien was filed against her on December 29, 1995, for non-payment of the federal tax debt, and that, as of July 21, 2003, the debt had not been satisfied (&para; 
1.b.); that she owed the Internal Revenue Service approximately $6,662.79 in taxes, penalties, and interest for tax year 1995, that a notice of federal tax lien had 
been filed against her on March 30, 2001, for non-payment of the federal tax debt, and that  as of July 21, 2003, the debt had not been satisfied (&para; 1.c.); that she 
owed the Internal Revenue Service approximately $1,022.01 in taxes, penalties and interest for tax year 1996, that a notice of federal tax lien had been filed 
against her March 30, 2001, and that, as of July 21, 2003, the debt had not been satisfied (&para; 1.d.); that she owed the Internal Revenue Service approximately 
$238.38 in taxes, penalties, and interest for tax year 1997, that a notice of federal tax lien had been filed against her on March 30, 2001, and that, as of July 21, 
2003, the debt had not been satisfied (&para; 1.e.); that she owed the Internal Revenue Service approximately $859.82 in taxes, penalties, and interest for tax year 
1998, that a notice of federal tax lien had been filed against her on March 30, 2001, and that, as of July 21, 2003, the debt had not been satisfied (&para; 1.f); that she 
owed the Internal Revenue Service approximately $3,201.12 in taxes, penalties, and interest for tax year 2000, and, as of July 21, 2003, the debt had not been 
satisfied (&para; 1.g.); that she owed the Internal Revenue Service approximately $6,928.29 in taxes, penalties, and interest for tax year 2001, and, as of July 21, 
2003, the debt had not been satisfied (&para; 1.h.); and that she owed her state tax board approximately $1,657.54 in taxes, penalties, and interest for tax years 1988, 
1989, and 1990, and, as of July 21, 2003, the debt had not been satisfied.(&para; 1.i.).  An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in 
illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the financial obligations identified in allegations at &para;&para; 1.a. through 1.i. of the SOR.  The Government has established, through the FORM 
and Applicant's admissions, a <EM>prima facie</EM> case that Applicant is financially overextended.  Applicant provided no persuasive evidence to rebut the financial 
concerns specified in the SOR and identified as disqualifying conditions under &para;&para; E2.A6.1.2.1., E.2.A6.1.2.2, and E2.A6.1.2.3. of Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We turn to a review of the several conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant's financial delinquencies.  Applicant's acknowledged 
delinquencies involve long-standing debts which continue to be unsatisfied to this day.  Thus, neither mitigating condition E2.A.6.1.3.1. nor mitigating 
condition E2.A6.1.3.2. applies.  If a person's financial delinquencies were largely caused by conditions beyond his or her control, then mitigating condition 
E2.A6.1.3.3 might apply.  Applicant provide no evidence that her financial delinquencies resulted from circumstances beyond her control.  Thus, mitigating 
condition E2.A6.1.3.3. does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed, sworn statement witnessed by a special agent of the Defense Security Service on February 13, 2002, Applicant stated she was, at that time, making 
an offer of compromise to the Internal Revenue Service to pay a portion of the taxes, penalties, and interest she owed.  (Item 6.)  In a signed, sworn statement 
witnessed by a special agent of the Defense Security Service on July 16, 2003, Applicant stated she had not had further contact with the Internal Revenue 
Service after February 2002.  (Item 8.)  The record establishes that Applicant sought legal assistance and counsel regarding her federal tax liabilities in 2004 and 
she is now committed to a monthly payment plan of $550.   Applicant has sought counseling, albeit belated, for her delinquent tax problem, and thus mitigating 
condition E2.A6.1.3.4 applies.  While she has recently established a payment plan to satisfy her federal tax obligations, it is too soon to tell if Applicant will 
follow through on her payment plan and whether it represents a good faith effort to pay her debts and to resolve her financial delinquencies and bring them 
under control.  Thus, mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.6. does not apply to the facts of Applicant's case.  Accordingly, the allegations in &para;&para; 1.a. through 1.i. of the 
SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant deliberately failed to disclose in response to Question 36 on her SF-86 that she had a tax lien placed against her by her 
county treasurer and tax collector on March 18, 1997 for $285.31 (&para; 2.a.(1)); that she had a tax lien placed against her by her county treasurer and tax collector 
on March 19, 1997 for $615.20 (&para; 2.a.(2)); that she had a tax lien placed against her by her county treasurer and tax collector on December 2, 1997 for $515.83 
(&para; 2.a.(3)); that she had a tax lien placed against her by her county treasurer and tax collector on December 7, 1998 for $522.03 (&para; 2.a.(4)); and that she had a tax 
lien placed against her by her county treasurer and tax collector on October 20, 1999 for $509 (&para;2.a.(5)).  DOHA also alleged Applicant deliberately failed to 
disclose in response to Question 36 the federal tax liens alleged in subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f. of the SOR. (&para; 2.a.(6)). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted all the falsification allegations in the SOR.  Her deliberate misrepresentations cause serious security concerns.  Conduct involving 
questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that an 
applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant's responsibility to provide truthful and complete responses to questions on his or her SF-86 cannot be set aside or ignored.  An applicant's 
financial history is material to a determination of his or her security worthiness.  With respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in SOR subparagraphs 2.a.(1) 
through 2.a.(6), Applicant falsified her SF-86 by omitting and concealing relevant and material information about tax liens placed against her property for 
failure to pay taxes.  Applicant's failure to answer Question 36 on her SF-86 truthfully and completely brings her conduct under disqualifying condition 
E2.A5.1.2.2.  The information Applicant withheld from her answer to Question 36 was pertinent to a determination of her judgment, trustworthiness, and 
reliability.  Thus, mitigating condition E2.A5.1.3.1 does not apply. She did not make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the falsification before being 
confronted with the facts, and thus mitigating condition  E2.A5.1.3.3. does not apply.  Applicant's falsifications were recent and not isolated incidents, and she 
did not supply the correct information voluntarily.  Thus mitigating condition E2.A5.1.3.2. does not apply.  Her refusal to supply correct information on her 
indebtedness on her SF-86 was not based on advice from legal counsel, and thus mitigating condition E2.A5.1.3.6. is inapplicable.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's deliberate concealment of her financial delinquencies increased her  vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress, and thus disqualifying 
condition E2.A5.1.2.4. applies.   Applicant's recently adopted plan to pay her federal tax liens is a positive step, and, as she carries out her plan, it will, over 
time, reduce or eliminate her vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.  Thus, mitigating condition E2.A5.1.3.5. applies in part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person's refusal to provide relevant and material information to the Government provides a rational basis for denial or revocation of access to classified 
information for that person.  ISCR Case No. 98-0445 at 3 (App. Bd. April 2, 1999), (quoting <EM>Gayer v. Schlesinger, </EM>490 F. 2d<EM> </EM>740, 754 (D.C. Cir. 1973); 
<EM>Clifford v. Shoultz</EM>, 413 F. 2d 868 (9<SUP>th</SUP> Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 396 U.S. 962 (1969)).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in the SOR, the Government has established its case.  Accordingly, the allegations in subparagraphs 2.a.(1) 
through 2.a.(6) of the SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  Security clearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose 
further punishment for past transgressions.  Rather, the objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his or 
her acts and omissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct.  Having done so, I conclude Applicant should not be entrusted with a security 
clearance.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors and guidelines in Department of Defense 
Directive, 5220.6, as amended. </SPAN></P>
