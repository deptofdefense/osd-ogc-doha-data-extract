<P>Applicant was convicted of burglary in 1984 and sentence to two years in prison, which he served.  Applicant has had no further criminal activity since his 
release from prison in 1986.  The Applicant did not falsify a questionnaire and has resolved his financial problems.  10 U.S.C. &sect;986 applies.  Adverse inference

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 16, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on August 11, 2003, and requested that the case be decided without a hearing.  </SPAN>The Government submitted its 
File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on or about November 21, 2003.  The Applicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit any 
documents in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation.  The Applicant received the FORM on December 4, 2003, and did not submit any additional information<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  The 
case was received by the undersigned on January 29, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 41 and married.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a security officer, and he seeks to obtain a DoD security clearance in connection 
with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and 
the live testimony.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged 
in criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Twenty years ago, in May 1984, the Applicant was arrested for Theft of Property.  According to the Applicant his brother stole several VCRs and gave the 
Applicant one of them.  The Applicant plead guilty to the charge and was sentenced to two years imprisonment, which he served.  (Government Exhibit 7.)  
Due to the Applicant's conviction and sentence to more than one year in prison, the provisions of 10 United States Code, Section 986 apply.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the Applicant was in prison in 1986, he was forced by other inmates to engage in a burglary while a trustee.  He was arrested for the offense, told the 
police what happened, and the charge was dismissed.  (Government Exhibits 3 and 11.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has not been involved in any other criminal conduct since his release from prison in 1986.  He states, "I ADMIT that I have criminal history.  I 
know my felony record will always surface for the rest of my life.  But what happened back then, stayed in the past.  I have been working hard for the society to 
accept me, to rely on me, and to trust me.  I succeeded doing just that.  God knows I'm a reliable, and trustworthy person.  I'm asking you to open your heart 
and have trust in me."  (Government Exhibit 3 at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline F - Financial considerations)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is 
financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 2.a. of the SOR alleges that the Applicant owes over $2,000 for a set of Encyclopedia Britannica.  Government Exhibits 9 and 10 show that the 
debt is actually in the name of the Applicant's wife.  She submitted a signed, sworn statement in which she accepts responsibility for lying to the Applicant 
about paying the bills.  In addition, she states that the Encyclopedia debt is her responsibility.  (Government Exhibit 3 at 5, 6 and 8.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant owed a deficiency balance on an automobile that was repossessed  (subparagraph 2.b.).  The Applicant submitted a receipt from the dealer 
indicating that the balance had been successfully paid off in July 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally 
falsified material aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 5, 2000, the Applicant completed an official DoD questionnaire in which he stated that he had not had any property repossessed in the last seven years.  
(Government Exhibit 4, question 27.b.)  This statement was incorrect, as the Applicant had an automobile repossessed in 1997.  The Applicant submits that he 
misunderstood this question stating, "I thought, at the time, that the questions, are asking about property (land).  I honestly [didn't] do anything deliberate.  It 
was a [misunderstanding] of the questions, [that's] all."  (Government Exhibit 3 at 3.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J (Criminal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) Conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial, of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.<A HREF="02-23630.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) the criminal behavior was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) the crime was an isolated incident;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in that person's life;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) the person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(6) there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F (Financial considerations)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) a history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(6) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in criminal conduct, falsification and have financial difficulties that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability 
on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has a felony criminal history, including a sentence to 
more than a year in prison (Guideline J); that he had a history of financial irresponsibility (Guideline F); and that he made an incorrect response on a 
Government questionnaire.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case against him, except in part.  Turning first to the financial conduct (Guideline F).  The Applicant had two past due debts.  The record shows 
that the debt for the encyclopedia actually belongs to his wife, who is the only debtor on the account.  The wife has accepted responsibility for that debt in 
writing.  The other debt, for a repossessed car, the Applicant paid off before he received the SOR.  Disqualifying condition 1 applies to the facts in this case (<EM>a 
history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>).  However, mitigating condition 6 (<EM>the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts</EM>) is sufficient to overcome that brief history.  Paragraph 2 is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding Paragraph 3 (Guideline E): The Applicant states that he misunderstood question 27.b. to only concern real property.  To many lay people, the fact 
that the term "property" can mean real property (land) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">and</SPAN> personal property (such as automobiles), is not well understood.  His explanation is reasonable and 
plausible and is accepted.  I find that the Applicant made a mistake in answering this question and did not intend to falsify his questionnaire.  Paragraph 3 is 
found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's criminal conviction and sentence to more than one year in prison occurred 20 years ago, when he was a young man of 21.  He served his time 
in prison and has no criminal record since he was released.  Under normal circumstances many of Guideline J's mitigating factors would apply to this case: <EM>(1) 
the criminal behavior was not recent; (2) the crime was an isolated incident; (3) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those 
pressures are no longer present in that person's life; (4) the person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely 
to recur; (6) there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>.  However, the Applicant's sentence brings the requirements of disqualifying condition 3 into 
play (<EM>conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial, of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year</EM>).  Pursuant to 
Federal law, 10 United States Code, Section 986, I have no discretion and must find against the Applicant under Paragraph 1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's efforts at reform are noted.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, this evidence does not overcome the adverse information that has 
been presented by the Government.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, 
the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.  
As set forth above, Paragraphs 2 and 3 are found for the Applicant. </SPAN></P>
