  The resolution of a case does not turn solely on the application or nonapplication of a particular Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying or mitigating condition.  Department Counsel has failed to demonstrate the Administrative Judge erred in his application of  Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 2.  The record evidence does not support the Judge's application of Foreign Influence Mitigating  Condition 1.  The Judge's application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 4 is not sufficient to support his favorable security clearance  decision.  Favorable decision reversed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated December 17, 2003 which 
stated the reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline B 
(Foreign Influence).  Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley issued a favorable security clearance decision dated July 30, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel appealed the Administrative Judge's favorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge misapplied Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 
2; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 applied to the case was arbitrary, 
capricious and contrary to law.  For the reasons that follow, the Board reverses the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine 
whether there is factual or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with 
specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with 
specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or 
capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or 
conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant 
evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the 
choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it 
offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere 
difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the 
Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, 
the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are 
conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of 
fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary 
evidence in the same record.  In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the 
Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is 
record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence 
supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a 
Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on 
appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at 
pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  
<EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P>

</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge misapplied Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 2</SPAN>.  Department Counsel maintains that Foreign 
Influence Disqualifying Condition 2<A HREF="01-10128.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> applies in this case because Applicant is married (since 1995) to a woman from the People's Republic 
of China (PRC).  Applicant's wife came to the United States in 1995 and obtained United States citizenship in 2000.  Her son (Applicant's 
stepson), a citizen of the PRC, once resided with Applicant and his wife for two periods in 2001 and 2002.  Department Counsel asserts that 
the record evidence establishes that Applicant's stepson is planning to return to the United States.  The Administrative Judge concluded that 
Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 2 had possible application to the case only because of Applicant's stepson's prior residence with 
Applicant and his wife.  The Judge then stated that the disqualifying condition appeared to have very limited applicability since the stepson's 
stay was short, and he returned to the PRC amidst very speculative prospects for returning.  </P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel argues that it was error for the Administrative Judge not to apply Disqualifying Condition 2 to Applicant's wife.  
Department Counsel cites the wife's history of negative interactions with the Chinese government and the fact that her family was once 
targeted by the Chinese government because of their social status as a basis for the existence of the potential for foreign duress because of 
Applicant's sharing living quarters with his wife.<A HREF="01-10128.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Department Counsel also argues that the Administrative Judge erred in holding that 
Disqualifying Condition 2 has only limited applicability in relation to Applicant's stepson.  In support of its argument, Department Counsel 
points to evidence that Applicant holds a facility clearance for his private residence and has been allowed to handle classified materials in the 
home.  Department Counsel also pointed to evidence that Applicant worked on classified documents in his home office during the period that 
his stepson was living there.  Department Counsel asserts that the evidence indicates that Applicant's stepson's return to the United States is 
likely and cannot be characterized as "very speculative."  Department Counsel has failed to demonstrate harmful error on the part of the 
Administrative Judge.</P> 
 
<P>The resolution of a security clearance case is not dependent upon the application or non-application of a particular disqualifying or mitigating 
condition.  Rather, the applicability of a particular disqualifying condition must be evaluated in light of all the record evidence in the case and 
in light of the potential applicability of other disqualifying factors.  Regarding Applicant's wife, Department Counsel fails to articulate a basis 
for the potential for foreign duress that is based exclusively on Applicant's wife's presence in Applicant's home.  There is no record evidence 
to the effect that Applicant's wife, a United States citizen, is a direct threat to the national security by virtue of her cohabiting with her 
husband.  There is considerable record evidence indicating that Applicant's wife is strongly loyal to and supportive of her adopted country and 
that her past thoughts and actions have been strongly antithetical to the PRC government.  Department Counsel concedes that the 
Administrative Judge correctly applied Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 1<A HREF="01-10128.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
<P> to the case.  In its appeal brief, with reference to 
Applicant's wife, Department Counsel makes arguments in support of the application of Disqualifying Condition 2 that are more supportive 
of the application of Disqualifying Condition 1.  Department Counsel discusses the fact that Applicant's wife still has immediate family 
members in the PRC and that she and her family have gained considerable notoriety in China.  To the extent that Disqualifying Condition 2 
addresses concerns about a person in Applicant's wife's position, those concerns overlap and are subsumed by the concerns articulated in 
Disqualifying Condition 1.  Thus, any error committed by the Administrative Judge in not applying Foreign Influence Disqualifying 
Condition 2 is harmless under the facts of this case.</P> 
 
<P>Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 2 is more directly applicable to Applicant's stepson, a citizen of the PRC whose loyalties to the 
United States vis-a-vis the PRC are not established by the record evidence and who has spent time at Applicant's residence during periods 
where Applicant was handling classified information there.  Department Counsel concedes that the Administrative Judge considered 
Disqualifying Condition 2 with regard to Applicant's stepson but argues the Judge gave it too little weight and by failing to do so, failed to 
consider an important aspect of the case.</P> 
 
<P>A reading of the totality of the Judge's decision reveals that he accorded very limited applicability to Disqualifying Condition 2 in relation to 
the stepson because the stepson stayed in the United States only for a short time and the stepson has only very speculative prospects for 
returning.  The record evidence indicates that the stepson returned to the PRC in December 2002 to marry his fianc&eacute;.  He remained there at 
the time of the hearing and there is conflicting evidence concerning the likelihood of his return.  Applicant indicated in December 2002 that 
his stepson had not adjusted well to living in the United States<A HREF="01-10128.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
<P> and would be returning to the PRC to marry and live permanently there.  At 
the hearing, Applicant's wife testified that her son was planning to return to the United States, work in a restaurant, and live with her and 
Applicant.  Applicant's wife testified that her son would come to the United States without his new wife even if the wife might have to wait 5 
years to join him here.</P> 
 
<P>There is no presumption of error below.  Given the state of the record evidence, the Judge had a rational basis for concluding that Applicant's 
stepson's return was speculative in nature.  He also had a rational basis for concluding that the applicability of Disqualifying Condition 2 was 
limited,  based on the evidence concerning the stepson's return and considering the fact that Applicant's stepson does not currently live with 
him.  Department Counsel bears the burden of establishing that the Judge assigned improper weight to Disqualifying Condition 2.   For the 
preceding reasons and because it does not argue with precision just how much additional weight the Judge should have given Disqualifying 
Condition 2 as it relates to Applicant's stepson, Department Counsel has failed to demonstrate error on this point.             </P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 applied to the case was arbitrary, capricious 
or contrary to law</SPAN>.  Department Counsel argues that Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="01-10128.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> 
<P> cannot rationally be applied to this case.  
Department Counsel's contention has merit.</P> 
 
<P>In applying Mitigating Condition 1, the Administrative Judge concluded that neither Applicant's wife nor any of her immediate family 
members (son, sister and two brothers) residing in the PRC have any financial or political affiliations with the PRC government, have any 
history to date of being subjected to any coercion or influence, or appear to be vulnerable to coercion or influence.  </P> 
 
<P>The Judge concluded that any realistic risk of a hostage situation or undue influence brought against Applicant's wife's family in the hopes of 
eliciting classified information or economic or proprietary data out of Applicant is lacking.  The Judge articulated his assessment that 
itigating Condition 1 must be construed to encompass realistic possibilities, not merely theoretical ones.  On appeal, Department Counsel 
points to Applicant's wife's close ties to her son, Applicant's ties of obligation to his stepson, the history of Applicant's wife with the PRC 
government, her immediate family members' history of mistreatment by the PRC government, Applicant's wife's regular visits to her siblings 
in the PRC and the fact that Applicant's son has lived in a home where classified documents are stored and he may live there in the future.  
Department Counsel then argues that the Judge erred by failing to accord appropriate weight to Applicant's wife's history in relation to the 
PRC government.  It also argued that the Judge's conclusion that there is no potential for exploitation or coercion by the PRC government is 
not rationally supported by the evidence.</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) Department Counsel is not required to prove that a foreign country has specifically targeted a 
particular applicant or applicant's spouse with immediate family members in that foreign country.<A HREF="01-10128.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 
<P>  Facts and circumstances that raise 
security concerns about an applicant's security eligibility can warrant an adverse security clearance decision without any proof that a foreign 
intelligence service has specifically targeted the applicant or sought to exploit those facts or circumstances.  The Administrative Judge's 
conclusion in this case that the risks of undue foreign influence created by Applicant's family ties to PRC citizens are too theoretically remote 
to warrant an adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary and capricious in light of the substantial body of record evidence establishing a 
history of negative interactions between the PRC government and members of Applicant's wife's family and the fact that Applicant's wife 
and her family have been specific targets of the PRC government in the past.  The second prong of Mitigating Condition 1 requires Applicant 
to establish that his in-laws in the PRC are not in a position to be exploited by the PRC in a way that could force Applicant to choose between 
those persons and the United States.  There is no record evidence in this case that supports application of the second prong of Mitigating 
Condition 1, and the Administrative Judge erred by applying it.          </P> 
 
<P>The Board recognizes that the Administrative Judge applied Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 4<A HREF="01-10128.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> 
<P> in this case and that application was 
not challenged on appeal.  The Board has frequently noted that the applicability or inapplicability of a specific disqualifying or mitigating 
condition is not necessarily dispositive of a case.  In light of the totality of the facts and circumstances in this case, the survival of the Judge's 
application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 4 on appeal is not sufficient to justify affirming or remanding the case.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel has met its burden of demonstrating harmful error below that warrants reversal.  Pursuant to Directive, Additional 
Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.33.3, the Board reverses the Administrative  Judge's favorable security clearance decision.</P>

</P> 
 
<P>I concur in the result reached by my colleagues.  However, I get there by another route.  This case is less about specific disqualifying or 
mitigating conditions than about a whole person analysis.  Applicant here has twice sought out foreign spouses.  In the most recent case he has 
entangled himself with a family much of which is still in the People's Republic of China (PRC).  I think that the applicability of individual 
conditions is less telling than the fact that Applicant has twice  deliberately set out to enmesh his life with women from other countries 
including a country with as problematic a history as the PRC.  It simply makes no sense to conclude that granting access to the nation's secrets 
to such a person is clearly consistent with the national interest.</P>

that the fact that Applicant's wife's son and her siblings in the PRC are not blood relatives of Applicant does not affect the potential threat
