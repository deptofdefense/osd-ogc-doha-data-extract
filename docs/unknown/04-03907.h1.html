<P>Applicant has two judgments against her totaling more than $9,000, a state tax lien for more than $2,800, accounts placed for collection in the amount of 
$2,692, and charged off accounts totaling more than $17,600. Although some of the delinquent debts may be attributable to conditions that were largely beyond

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. In accordance with Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 &para; E3.1.2 (Jan 2. 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 27 September 2005 detailing the basis for its 
decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 1 November 2005 
and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 29 November 2005. On 23 February 2006, I convened a hearing to 
consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript 
(Tr.) on 6 March 2006. I kept the record open until 9 March 2006 so Applicant could photocopy her pay stubs (Ex. C) for the record. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 42-year-old self-employed subcontractor for defense contractors. She has been in the military environment all her life. Her father retired from the 
military and became a government contractor. Her mother is a federal civil servant and her brother is a member of the U.S. Air Force Reserve. Applicant has 
been involved with the government contracting process since 1980 and has held a secret security clearance since 1994. </P> 
<P>Applicant admits being in a bad financial situation for the past 10-15 years. She is married and has two special needs children. Her husband is a recovering 
alcoholic who has been sober for two years. Before his recovery, he took money from his wife's account and spent it without notifying her. In 2002, she 
established her own business. He has degenerative arthritis and has not worked in almost three years.</P> 
<P>She was awarded a subcontract from a defense contractor in November 2004. Her monthly gross is now $12-18,000. She pays herself about $5,000 a month to 
pay her living expenses.</P> 
<P>Applicant has two judgments against her totaling more than $9,000 (&para; 1.a-1.b), a state tax lien for more than $2,800 (&para; 1.c), accounts placed for collection in the 
amount of $2,692 (&para;&para; 1.d-1.f), and charged off accounts totaling more than $17,600 (&para;&para; 1.g-1.i, 1.k-1.m). Her monthly income now exceeds her monthly 
expenses. Applicant has consulted with a certified public accountant for more than two years. He is going to help her set up a payment plan to resolve her debts. 
No payments have been made on any of her delinquent debts. She does not want to make settlement arrangements on her delinquent accounts because she 
believes it could affect her security clearance and her future credit status. At the present time, she does not have any credit cards. If she loses her security 
clearance, it will greatly affect her family's financial health and her ability to pay her delinquent debts.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had two judgments totaling more than $9,000 (&para; 1.a-1.b), a state tax lien for more than $2,800 (&para; 1.c), accounts placed for 
collection in the amount of $2,692 (&para;&para; 1.d-1.f), charged off accounts totaling more than $17,600 (&para;&para; 1.g-1.i, 1.k-1.m), and her monthly expenses exceed her 
monthly income by more than $3,500 (&para; 1.n). In her answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations. An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk 
of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence each of the allegations in the SOR, except &para; 1.n.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial 
obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1.) and is unable or unwilling to satisfy her debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3.).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> An applicant may mitigate financial considerations security 
concerns by establishing that her financial situation resulted from conditions that were largely beyond her control (MC E2.A6.1.3.3); she received counseling 
and the problem is being resolved or is under control (MC E2.A6.1.3.4); or she initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her 
debts (MC E2.A6.1.3.6).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Some of Applicant's financial problems are directly attributable to her husband's alcoholism and his withdrawing money from her account without notifying 
her. And, although she did not establish any direct correlation to her debts, I have considered the special costs often associated with raising special needs 
children. At the same time, Applicant must bear some responsibility for not closing out those accounts her husband was abusing. Some of her delinquent debts 
are as low as $40, $52, and $56, but Applicant has neither paid them nor contacted the creditors. Although her CPA acknowledges he is in the process of 
making payment plans with the creditors on her personal accounts, no payments have been made and no plans established. After considering all of the evidence, 
the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, as well as the adjudicative process factors, I find against Applicant. She has not demonstrated she is on the road to 
satisfying her delinquent debts. Applicant did establish that she is now making considerably more each month than she spends. I find for Applicant on &para; 1.n.</SPAN></P>
