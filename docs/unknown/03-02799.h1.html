<P>In 1981, when he was 18 years old, Applicant deliberately violated federal law by failing to register for the draft with the U.S. Selective Service System 
because he found such registration morally repugnant and against his conscience.  Applicant defends his decision and would undoubtedly refuse to register if 
ordered to do so today.  Applicant failed to mitigate the criminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns raised by his conduct.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 15 September 2003, DOHA issued 
a Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-02799.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 13 August 2003 and elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a 
hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on 11 May 2004.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was 
provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  
Applicant received the FORM on 20 May 2004, but failed to respond.  The case was assigned to me on 9 July 2004.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a systems administrator for a defense contractor.  He was born on 7 April 1963.  He is married and has two children.  Applicant turned 18 years of 
age in 1981.  Applicant received a secret clearance in 1992.  Item 4 at 10.  He turned 26 years of age in 1994.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant never registered for the draft under the Selective Service Act (50 U.S.C. &sect; 453) because the idea of registering for a military draft is morally 
repugnant to him.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 8.  He made the decision not to register after serious consideration.  He believes registering for the draft would be giving up his 
freedom.  <EM>Id.</EM>  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a 
position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to 
United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, 
honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to 
abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 
4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a 
nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec 19, 2002); </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Every male U.S. citizen between the ages of 18 and 26 is required to register for the draft under the Selective Service Act in the manner determined by 
proclamation of the President.  50 U.S.C. &sect; 453(a).  The President determined that persons required to register under 50 U.S.C. &sect; 453, born after 1 January 
1963, are required to present themselves for registration within 60 days of their 18<SUP>th</SUP>  birthday.  Exec. Procl. 4771, 45 F.R. 45247, 94 Stat. 3775 (1980).  Any 
person required to register who knowingly fails or neglects to register who is convicted of such offense may be punished upon conviction in federal court by 
imprisonment for not more than five years, a fine, or both.  50 U.S.C. &sect; 462(a).  No person shall be prosecuted for failing to register unless the indictment is 
found within five years next after the last day before such person attains the age of twenty-six.  50 U.S.C. &sect; 462(d).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J-Criminal Conduct </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant failed to register with the U.S. Selective Service System as required by 50 U.S.C. &sect; 453 (&para; 1.a).  A history or pattern of 
criminal activcity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established the allegation by Applicant's admissions.  Applicant committed a serious criminal offense by failing to register for the draft.  DC 
E2.A10.1.2.1., E2.A10.1.2.2.  The fact that he was never charged or convicted of the offense is not dispositive.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-12452 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Jan. 27, 2003).  Although the running of the statute of limitations prevented prosecution of this offense after 1994, that does not prevent a finding adverse to 
Applicant.  ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003).  Applicant's offense was not recent (MC E2.A10.1.3.1.)-it occurred 23 years ago when 
Applicant failed to register within 60 days of his 18<SUP>th</SUP> birthday.<A HREF="03-02799.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  It was an isolated incident.  MC E2.A10.1.3.2.  There is no evidence Applicant has committed 
any additional crimes.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant's refusal to register for the draft was an isolated event and occurred over 23 years ago, Applicant has not met his burden to mitigate his 
conduct and establish it is clearly in the national interest to grant him a security clearance.  Applicant's criminal conduct and his continued defense of that 
criminal conduct as the reasoned and conscientious decision of an individual who is unwilling to violate his conscience creates doubt about his judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness.  Applicant is not rehabilitated.  He has no remorse for his actions and would undoubtedly again refuse to register if called upon 
to do so.  The Government recognizes that some individuals are conscientiously opposed to fighting wars and has made specific provision for those persons to 
avoid combat by acquiring conscientious objector status.  Applicant did not register and apply for conscientious objector status.  He simply refused to follow 
the law because it conflicts with his conscience.  Applicant believes the only law he has to obey is his own conscience.  An applicant who is unwilling to 
follow the law when it does not conveniently fit within his own personal notions of what is right is not a good security risk.  After considering all of the 
evidence, including the adjudicative factors in &para; 6.3 of the directive, I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant failed to register with the U.S. Selective Service System as required by 50 U.S.C. &sect; 453 (&para; 2).  Conduct involving 
questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate the 
applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established the allegation by Applicant's admissions.  Applicant's refusal to register for the draft is unfavorable information that raises a 
security concern regarding Applicant's judgment, trustworthiness, reliability, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations.  DC E2.A5.1.2.1.  None of 
the mitigating conditions apply.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are predictive judgments about a person's security suitability in light of that person's past conduct and present circumstances. 
<EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 528-29.   Applicant has the burden of establishing that it is in the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.  He failed to do 
so.  Before granting a security clearance, I must be convinced Applicant will protect classified information.  But Applicant agrees to follow only those rules 
and regulations that do not violate his conscience.  He substitutes his personal beliefs for the reasoned judgments of the Government.  Applicant is not suitable 
for a clearance.  I find against Applicant on &para; 2.</SPAN></P>
