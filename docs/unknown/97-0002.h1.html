<P>On January 14, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make
the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  In an unsworn<A HREF="97-0002.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> written
statement, dated January 31, 1997, the Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR and requested a hearing.  A copy of the SOR is attached to
this Decision and incorporated herein by reference.</P>

<P>The case was assigned on February 19, 1997, to Administrative Judge Mason, and re-assigned on February 24, 1997, for reasons of caseload reallocations to the
undersigned Administrative Judge.  The undersigned held a hearing on March 25, 1997.  The Department Counsel presented fourteen exhibits ("Exhs") and the
testimony of two witnesses.  The Applicant presented no exhibits other than those attached to his answer to the SOR and no witnesses other than himself. The
undersigned Ad-ministrative Judge received the transcript ("Tr") of the hearing on April 8, 1997.</P>

<P><U><STRONG>RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</U></STRONG></P>

<P>At the outset of the hearing the parties were informed that official notice would be taken of certain pages of the <EM><U>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders</U></EM>, Fourth Edition (1994), or DSM-IV.  Those pages were provided at that time to the parties, who had no objection.  Tr pages 19-20.</P>

<P><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></STRONG></P>

<P>The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on a single criterion: paragraph 1, Criterion G (alcohol consumption).  The Applicant has
admitted the factual allegations contained in subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.d. of the SOR.  Except as noted herein, the Applicant's admissions are hereby
incorporated as findings of fact.</P>

<P>The undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, makes the
following additional Findings of Fact:</P>

<P>The Applicant is a 60-year-old ---------------- employed by a U.S. Government contractor.  The Applicant seeks to retain a Secret<A NAME="level seeking or to retain?"></A> personnel security clearance
originally granted him in 1980.</P>

<P>The Applicant drank beer on a daily basis for about 15 years (1981-96) and increased his average daily consumption to two quarts (or a six-pack) of beer during
1993-95.  Tr pages 142-144.  He sometimes drank in the morning and during lunch breaks as well as during the evening.  Exhibits 2, 11; tr pages 174-175.  He
sought medical help in 1995 for his depressive mood that had begun in about 1993.  He also resumed cigarette smoking in about 1993 after having quit smoking
for 15 years and was in 1995 smoking two packs of cigarettes a day.  Exhibit 9.  While never intoxicated or drinking at work, the Applicant on occasion smelled
of alcohol at work, but has not since January 1996.  Exhibit 14; tr pages 31-34, 37-42, 79-91, 94-96, 120, 159-160, 199.  In June or July 1995 he went to his
HMO primary care physician because he was tired all the time, had lost weight, slept irregularly, and was worried about his job security; the doctor diagnosed
him with depression and high anxiety.  Tr pages 108-109.  In August-October 1995 the Applicant was diagnosed as suffering from major depression and chronic
alcohol abuse.<A HREF="97-0002.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  Exhibits 9, 11, 12, and 13.  His HMO primary care physician discussed with the Applicant "the need to stop using alcohol" and  to "start
decreasing his alcohol intake."  Exhibit 9; tr pages 171-172.<A HREF="97-0002.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>   The Applicant separated from his wife in late 1995.  Tr pages 106-107, 145-148, 200-201.  They
have been married about 39 years. </P>

<P>On January 18, 1996, the Applicant had a one-vehicle accident in the early evening.  He had been drinking that afternoon and again at dinner.  He drove his
pick-up truck into a large tree and totaled the truck.  The dispatched local policeman noticed a strong odor of alcohol about the Applicant's person.  The
Applicant admitted to the policeman that he had drunk 5-6 beers at dinner and failed a field sobriety test the policeman then administered.  The Applicant's
blood alcohol content (BAC) was tested at 0.321%.  Exhibit 5.  For the prior 3 months he had taken a prescribed stimulant or antidepressant daily.  Exhibit 7; tr
pages 178, 209.  On January 23, 1996, the Applicant was formally charged with, <EM>inter alia</EM>, Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) and failing to drive
within a single lane of a roadway laned for traffic.  Exhibit 4.  </P>

<P>In May 1996 he was placed in a pre-trial diversionary program for first-time non-violent offenders, pleaded guilty to the charge of "disregard traffic lane," was
fined $25 and costs, was required to perform a day of community service and complete an alcohol safe driving course, and was placed on unsupervised
probation for 12 months.  His operator's license was suspended for 30 days.  Exhibit 3; <EM>see</EM> the Applicant's SOR answer.  Tr pages 68-72, 128-129.  The
Applicant voluntarily attended about 4-5 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings and went to outpatient counseling during January-July 1996   Exhibit 2; <EM>see</EM> the
Applicant's SOR answer; tr pages 112-113, 155-156, 202-204.  Shortly after his DUI the Applicant was diagnosed by another psychiatrist as suffering from
"severe depression, aggravated by too much drinking."  Tr page 113.  The psychiatrist recommended an inpatient 30-day alcohol care program, but the
Applicant declined due to job and business responsibilities.  Tr page 121.  That psychiatrist then prescribed Wellbutrin,<SUP>&reg;</SUP> an antidepressant, and told him not to
drink alcohol at all, especially when taking the prescription medicine.  The Applicant did not drink for about six months. Tr pages 110-118, 150-152, 186-18,
210 224.  After cessation of that drug intervention, he resumed "occasional" drinking in July 1996, currently drinking 2-3 times a week but no more than 2-3
drinks at time and never at noontime or in the morning.  Tr pages 118-119, 132-133, 153-155.  He is involved in no programs at the present time to monitor his
alcohol use, but should he begin drinking heavily again he would go back to his family and the psychiatrist for support.  Tr pages 122-127, 157.</P>

<P>In May 1996, the Applicant received a very good job performance evaluation without any indication of alcohol impact on that performance, and in July 1996 he
was recommended for promotion because he "has consistently demonstrated that his abilities far exceed the descriptions of his present grade."  Exhibits A and B
to the SOR answer.  He received the promotion.  Tr pages 47, 57, 125.  His supervisor testified to the "very unique" capabilities of the Applicant within the
staff.  Tr pages 47-48, 73.</P>

<P><U><STRONG>POLICIES</U></STRONG></P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluation of an individual's
security eligibility.  The guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or revoke a clearance (Disqualifying
Conditions or DC) and those that may be considered in determining whether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified information (Mitigating
Conditions or MC).  In evaluating this case, relevant adjudicative guidelines as set forth below have been carefully con-sidered as the most pertinent to the facts
of this particular case.</P>

<P>The criteria, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating conditions most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case are:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>CRITERION G - ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of
unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG>  </P>

<P>  (1) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to
alcohol use; </P>

<P>  (3) diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional<FONT SIZE="-1"><FONT FACE="Times"><SUP></FONT></FONT></SUP> (cre-dentialed medical professional: licensed physician, licensed clinical psychologist, or board certified
psych-iatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence;</P>

<P>  (5) consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed medical professional (cre-dentialed medical professional: licensed
physician, licensed clinical psychologist, or board certified psych-iatrist) and following completion of an alcohol rehabil-itation program</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P>

<P>  (1) the alcohol related incidents do not indicate a pattern; </P>

<P>  (4) following diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol de-pendence, the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with
after-care requirements, participates frequently in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization, abstained from alcohol for a period of at least
12 months, and received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional (credentialed medi-cal professional:  licensed physician, licensed clinical
psychologist, or board certified psychiatrist).</P>

<P>The Directive also requires the undersigned to consider, as appropriate, the factors enumerated in Section F.3:</P>

<P>a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</P>

<P>b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P>

<P>c. Age of the applicant.</P>

<P>d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences
involved.</P>

<P>e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P>

<P>f. Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</P>

<P>Enclosure 2 to the Directive provides that the adjudicator should consider the following factors:</P>

<P>The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</P>

<P>The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P>

<P>The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<P>The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<P>The voluntariness of participation</P>

<P>The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes</P>

<P>The motivation for the conduct</P>

<P>The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</P>

<P>The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</P>

<P>Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made
only upon an affirmative finding that to do so is <U>clearly consistent</U> with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense
determination required, the Administrative Judge may only draw those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of
record.  Determinations under the Directive include consideration of the risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly
classified information as that term is defined and established under Executive Order 12958, effective on October 14, 1995.</P>

<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme Court has said:</P>

<P>It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence standard without departing
from the 'clearly consistent with the interests of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations
should err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government to support the denial [of a security clearance] by a preponderance of the
evidence would inevitably shift the emphasis and involve the Board in second-guessing the agency's national security determinations.</P>

<P> <EM>Dept. of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that Supreme Court guidance in its context to go to the minimum
<STRONG><EM>quantum</EM></STRONG> of the admissible evidence that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its case, that is, substantial evidence but something
less than a preponderance of the evidence -- rather than as an indication of the Court's tolerance for error below.<A HREF="97-0002.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his or her security eligibility through evidence of
refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case or through evidence of affirmative defenses.  Assuming the Government's case is not refuted, and
further assuming it can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an applicant might deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified
information, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he or she is nonetheless eligible to hold a security clearance.<A HREF="97-0002.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility and demeanor of those who
testified, the undersigned concludes that the Government established its case with regard to Criterion G.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">The evidence in the record reveals the Applicant as a person of mature years--in his 40's--beginning to abuse alcohol around the time he originally was granted
a personnel security clear-ance.  He built up a large tolerance for alcohol due to daily consumption.  By his late 50's he was drinking about two quarts of beer a
day; his 0.321% BAC in January 1996 is remarkable evidence of the extent of that tolerance.  While this is evidence of the "habitual consumption of alcohol,"
there is little evidence that it led "to the point of impaired judgment," in the words of DC #4, possibly because of such tolerance.  It simply took increasing large
quantities of alcohol before he felt the effects.  Nevertheless, motor skills are impaired with high BAC readings, and an attempt to operate a motor vehicle with
a high BAC demonstrates poor judgment.  On the other hand, the Applicant was able to perform his job at more than a satisfactory level, demonstrating that his
mental skills and technical abilities were unimpaired.  DC #2, pertaining to alcohol-related incidents at work, is inap-plicable to these facts inasmuch as he
never drank at work<A HREF="97-0002.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> and inasmuch as he was never drunk at work or reported to work in an impaired condition.  There is evidence that the Applicant on more
than a few occasions had the odor of alcohol about his person while at work, which qualifies as "alcohol-related incidents" for purposes of DC #2; yet his job
performance evaluation in May 1996 notes that the Applicant "interfaces with numerous vendors and suppliers on a daily basis" and "represents the projects and
[his employer] very professionally and effectively."  Exhibit A, page 4, to the SOR answer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">The Applicant has had one arrest for DUI.  Only one alcohol-related incident away from work does not meet the literal terms of DC #1, identified on page 4
<STRONG><EM>supra</EM></STRONG>; only "criminal incidents" fall within the scope of DC #1.  Similarly, only one such incident does satisfy the literal terms of MC #1, identified on page 5
<EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>, relating to the absence of "a pattern of alcohol related incidents."  On the other hand, even one DUI is a cause for some concern--even where, as here,
there was no con-viction, yet there is abundant evidence of criminal conduct.  MC #2 is inapplicable because the Applicant's alcohol problem did not simply
occur "a number of years ago," nor are there "no indic-ations" whatever of a recent problem.  MC #3 has little application to the facts because the "positive
changes in behavior supportive of sobriety" are relatively modest in light of his continued alcohol consumption and the lack of a current support system, such as
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), to counsel sobriety.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Weight is given to the diagnoses of alcohol abuse both before and after the DUI arrest pro-vided by credentialed medical professionals and the medical advice
given to the Applicant to enter an inpatient rehabilitation program and to stop drinking entirely.  See DC #3, identified on page 5 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  Additional weight is
given to the Applicant's unwillingness to take this professional medical advice.  DC #5, identified on page 5 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>, is ambiguous as to whether it is strictly
applicable when <STRONG>either</STRONG> there has been a diagnosis of alcoholism <STRONG>or</STRONG> when an alcohol rehabilitation program has been completed, or whether it is applicable only
when <STRONG>both</STRONG> premises exist.  While it is clear that "alcoholism" is psychiatrically different than "alcohol abuse" according to the DSM-IV, the Applicant's
consumption of alcohol contrary to the advice he received and the many adverse consequences of his DUI arrest have direct security significance.  Clearly, the
facts do not suggest the availability of the sort of mitigation outlined in MC #4, identified on page 5 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  In this regard, this Administrative Judge  is
instructed by the Adjudicative Guidelines (Encl. 2 to the Directive, page 2-3) to consider whether the person "sought assistance and followed professional
guidance, where appropriate."  Though he sought medical help voluntarily before his DUI arrest, he was dissatisfied with the results of the advice and
medication he was given and only returned for additional medical help from a different doctor after his DUI arrest.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><A NAME="F.3 Directive analysis"></A>Each case decision is required to consider, as appropriate, the factors listed in Section F.3 and enclosure 2 to the Directive.  Those factors are identified on pages
5-6 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  The Applicant has a serious, lengthy, and continuing alcohol problem that he denies although he has not been intoxicated  for the last 14 months or
so.  The absence of current rehabilitation as well as the recency of his DUI arrest--and, indeed, education in the course of alcoholism--suggest recurring and
deepening health problems yet await the Applicant.  The lack of meaningful readily-available support in containing his alcohol abuse bodes particularly
threatening in light of the diagnosis of major depression without appropriate current drug treatment to deal with it.  His maturity must also be discounted as a
viable contribution towards mitigation.</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">FORMAL FINDINGS</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Formal findings as required by Enclosure 1 of the Directive (see paragraph (7) of section 3 of Executive Order 10865, as amended) and the additional
procedural guidance contained in item 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</FONT></P>
