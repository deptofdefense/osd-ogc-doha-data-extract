<P>Applicant received a discharge of more than $17,000.00 in debts under chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code in July 1993. As of June 2003, he had accumulated 
more than $21,000.00 in delinquent accounts, and had deferred repayment of approximately $64,000.00 in student loans. He has now either satisfied or made 
arrangements to expeditiously satisfy his delinquent accounts, and entered into an agreement that will allow him to repay his student loans over the course of 
the next thirty years. Applicant's belated effort to repay long-standing past-due creditors is insufficient to mitigate the security concern caused by his many 
years of financial irresponsibility. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On June 6, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-23604.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges a security concern under Guideline F, financial considerations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a sworn answer to the SOR that was received by DOHA on June 23, 2003, and requested a hearing. Applicant admitted all allegations 
contained in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to another administrative judge on September 16, 2003, and reassigned to me on November 21, 2003, due to caseload considerations. A 
notice of hearing was issued on December 2, 2003, scheduling the hearing for December 18, 2003. I cancelled the scheduled hearing for personal reasons. A 
second notice of hearing was issued on January 13, 2004, rescheduling the hearing for February 5, 2004. The hearing was conducted as rescheduled. The 
government submitted seven documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-7 and admitted into the record without an objection. 
Applicant testified and submitted seventeen documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-17 and admitted into the record without an 
objection. The transcript was received on February 18, 2004.     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the allegations contained in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 35 years old, single, has no children, and supports no one other than himself. He has been employed by a defense contractor since April 2000, 
presently works as an aircraft systems engineer, and earned more than $62,000 in 2003. The letters of recommendation and performance evaluation worksheet 
he submitted attest to his reputation for being a valued employee who is considered to be trustworthy, honest and of high integrity. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant attended college from 1987 to 1993, but left prior to receiving a degree because of financial constraints. He later returned to college and received a 
bachelor of science degree in aerospace engineering in August 1999. Applicant worked while attending school, and at all times in between, with the exception 
of a period of unemployment from June 1994 to October 1994. Additionally, he was underemployed for a short period of time in approximately March 1997 
because of a work-related injury, and again for several months beginning in approximately September 1997  because of a labor strike. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection on April 2, 1993, and was granted a discharge on October 16, 2003. He discharged approximately 
$17,000.00 in debt at that time, including a $5,1000.00 judgment that arose from an auto accident, $2,200.00 in credit card debt, and a personal loan in the 
amount of $3,627.36. Applicant attributes his need to file for bankruptcy to financial irresponsibility and the fact that he was living beyond his means. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant again had substantial delinquent debt as of June 2003, totaling more than $21,000.00. That amount includes a deficit of more than $8,000.00 owing 
following the repossession of a vehicle, and more than $11,000.00<A HREF="02-23604.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> in credit card debt that had been written off as bad debt. In addition to the delinquent 
accounts, Applicant had approximately $64,000.00 in student loans that were deferred due to financial hardship.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has been working for the same employer since 2000, and was transferred by the employer to his current state of residency in August 2003. He was 
provided a relocation allowance by the employer as partial compensation for the move, that he has used to satisfy some of his delinquent accounts. He has 
transferred the balance of one of the delinquent credit cards to a new credit card on which he is  making payments. He also is now residing with his mother and 
not paying rent, which has allowed him to apply the money he is saving to satisfy additional creditors. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has consolidated all his student loans into a single loan and entered into a repayment agreement that will allow him to satisfy that account in thirty 
years. He has a workable plan that will allow him to pay all remaining delinquent accounts within the very near future, and has indicated he will them be in a 
position to satisfy the student loans in considerably less time than the thirty years agreed to. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant attributes his present financial difficulties to unemployment and underemployment he experienced in 1997. However, he has worked continuously 
since that time, including the past four years with his present employer. He did not take action to resolve the delinquent accounts until sometime after he 
received the SOR in June 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">         </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">F, pertaining to financial considerations, with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">  </SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-23604.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-23604.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="02-23604.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="02-23604.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-23604.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-23604.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-23604.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-23604.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="02-23604.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed 
access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.<A HREF="02-23604.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides 
an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case under Guideline F. Applicant secured a discharge in bankruptcy in 1993, and then acquired significant delinquent debt 
that was outstanding, and on which no payments were being made, as of June 2003. He acknowledges the bankruptcy was caused by his financial 
irresponsibility and living beyond his means. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>: and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts </EM>apply in this case.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has recently fully satisfied several of his delinquent accounts, and has arranged to repay the remaining accounts, with the exception of the student 
loans, in the near future. Once he has satisfied the remaining delinquent accounts, he will be able to expedite repayment of the student loans. MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debt</EM> applies in this case. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">However, while Applicant is presently living within his means, and is rapidly attaining financial stability, it is too soon to predict with any degree of reliability 
that he will continue on his current path. He has a track record of financial irresponsibility that spans more than a decade, and fails in his attempt to blame the 
present delinquencies on loss of income he sustained more than six years ago. He took no action to resolve the accounts until recently, despite being gainfully 
employed and having no one but himself to support. Further, at least two of the accounts were initially opened after his periods of unemployment and 
underemployment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>       </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, including Applicant's character references, the circumstances he attributes to 
being the cause of him becoming severely delinquent on various accounts, the recent actions he has taken to return his finances to order, the whole person 
concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find that Applicant has failed 
to mitigate this security concern. It is impossible to reconcile his demonstrated irresponsibility with the degree of trust and confidence that must be placed in 
one who is granted access to the nation's secrets. Applicant has failed to overcome the case against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion.  Guideline 
F is decided against Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
