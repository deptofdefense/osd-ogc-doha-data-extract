<P>Applicant accumulated delinquent debts between about 1989 and 2002.  The debts arose largely from circumstances beyond his control, including his 
separation and contested divorce, his injury in an automobile accident and resulting lost wages, his mother's illness and subsequent death, several periods of 
unemployment, and a second automobile accident causing the destruction of his vehicle.  Applicant obtained a degree and a better-paying job, and began paying 
off his delinquent debts.  He obtained financial counseling and either paid off or negotiated a payment plan for substantially all his delinquent debts.  Applicant 
mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial difficulties.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On March 19, 2003, Applicant submitted an application for a security clearance.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended 
and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and 
modified (the "Directive").  On January 20, 2005, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.  The SOR alleges security 
concerns raised under the Directive, Guideline F, Financial Considerations.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on February 28, 2005.  He elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.</P> 
<P>I received the case on August 1, 2005.  With the concurrence of Applicant and Department Counsel, I convened the hearing on September 14, 2005.  The 
government introduced Exhibits 1 through 5.  Applicant provided Exhibits A through P and testified on his own behalf.  At Applicant's request, I kept the 
record open to allow Applicant additional time to submit documents.  Thereafter, Applicant submitted Exhibits Q through CC, which were admitted without 
objection.  DOHA received the final transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 27, 2005. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant denied the factual allegations in &para; 1.n of the SOR.  Applicant's Answer to SOR, dated May 17, 2005.  He admitted the factual allegations in the 
remaining paragraphs of the SOR, with explanations.  <EM>Id.</EM>  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review 
of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
<P>Applicant is 46 years old.  Ex. 1 at 1.  He works as a computer specialist for a defense contractor.  Tr. at 71.</P> 
<P>Applicant entered active duty in the U.S. Army in January 1978 and served until November 1989, rising to the grade of E-5.  Ex. 1 at 10.  He held a Secret 
clearance for a period while on active duty in the Army.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 13.  In about 1986 or 1987, when Applicant applied for a higher clearance, the security 
investigation revealed delinquent financial accounts.  Ex. 2 at 4; Tr. at 69.  Authorities denied the higher clearance and revoked Applicant's Secret clearance.  
<EM>Id.</EM>  </P> 
<P>After leaving the Army, Applicant held a variety of short-term jobs.  Ex. 2 at 4.  He held 16 different jobs during the seven years between 1989 and June 2002.  
The positions did not pay well enough for Applicant to support himself and his family, and he fell behind on his debts.  Ex. 2 at 4.  He was also unemployed for 
brief periods between some of the jobs.  Tr. at 54-57. </P> 
<P>Other factors made Applicant's financial situation more difficult.  He was married in1983.  Ex. 1 at 8.  On December 24, 1994, his wife attempted suicide in 
front of their six-year-old child, and was hospitalized.  Ex. D.  In 1995, Applicant initiated divorce proceedings.  <EM>Id.  </EM>His wife sued for custody of the minor 
child.  After considerable litigation and substantial expense, Applicant agreed to grant primary custody to his wife, with visitation privileges.  Tr. at 20-21.  He 
was divorced in 1996.  Tr. at 66.  In 1996, Applicant was injured in an automobile accident, resulting in lost income and unexpected medical bills.  Ex. B; Tr. at 
17-18.  In 1998, Applicant's mother became ill.  Tr. at 19.  Applicant left his job and moved to be able to care for her, incurring additional expenses.  Tr. at 19-20, 64.  His mother passed away in October 1998.  Ex. C; Tr. at 64.  In May 2002, Applicant lost his job due to downsizing of the project.  Ex. A.  Applicant 
was let go one day before his wedding.  Tr. at 16.  He was unemployed between May and August 2002, increasing his financial difficulties.  Ex. 1 at 4. </P> 
<P>In September 1999, Applicant began taking classes at a local college.  Ex. 2 at 4.  He obtained an associate's degree in March 2002.  Ex. 1 at 3.  The degree 
made Applicant eligible for better jobs.  Tr. at 37-38.</P> 
<P>In June 2000, Applicant joined the U.S. Army Reserve.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 10.  He is a noncommissioned officer, and serves as an executive administrative assistant for a 
signals brigade.  Ex. L.  His commanders and co-workers praise his skill, motivation and leadership.  Exs. I, J, K, L, and CC.  They also recommend his 
selection to attend Warrant Officer Candidate School.  Exs. I, J, and K.  Applicant completed the necessary training to serve as an information systems operator 
analyst and was awarded that military occupational speciality (MOS), subject to his receipt of a security clearance.  Ex. M; Tr. at 42. </P> 
<P>In June 2002, Applicant began working in his present position as a systems architect (computer specialist) for a defense contractor.  Ex. 1 at 3.  He also enrolled 
in a local college and began taking classes to obtain a bachelor's degree.  Ex. 1 at 3.  </P> 
<P>His improved financial circumstances made him able to begin paying off outstanding creditors. In 2003, before the initiation of this action, Applicant contacted 
a credit counseling service, arranged a debt repayment plan, and began making regular payments toward some outstanding debt.  Ex. H; Ex. G at 2.  Some of the 
creditors would not join in the debt repayment plan.  Tr. at 52; Ex. W at 2.  The credit counseling service provided resources about financial planning, 
budgeting and investments.  Tr. at 49.</P> 
<P>In October 2004, Applicant was the victim of another vehicle accident that destroyed his vehicle.  Ex. P; Tr. at 45.  This unexpected loss made him unable to 
continue with the formal debt repayment plan.  Tr. at 45-46; Ex. BB.  However, he readjusted his payment rates and continued paying on some delinquent 
debts. Tr. at 47, 72.  Applicant paid off some debts and began making payments on other outstanding accounts.  Tr. at 72-73.</P> 
<P>Applicant is current on his ordinary living expenses and has not incurred any new delinquent debt since obtaining his present position.  Tr. at 38, 52-53.  He 
also established savings and retirement accounts through his employer.  Ex. N.</P> 
<P>The current status of the debts listed in the SOR is shown in the chart below.  Applicant made some arrangements for payment plans after the hearing.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently

Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding 
classified information within the executive branch. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this 
case is: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Guideline</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> F, Financial Considerations - An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive 
&para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, 
reliable information about the person. <EM> Id.</EM>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age 
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
<EM>Id.</EM> <BR> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.  Directive, &para; E3.1.14.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  Directive, &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent 
with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive, &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President has established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A6.1.2.1 of the Directive provides that it may be a disqualifying condition if the evidence reveals "[a] history of not meeting financial 
obligations.<EM>"</EM>  Similarly, &para; E2.A6.1.2.3 indicates that an "[i]nability or unwillingness to satisfy debts" may be disqualifying.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of not 
meeting his financial obligations.  He had substantial delinquent debts that have remained unpaid for many years.  I find Applicant has shown both a history of 
failing to meet his financial obligations and an inability to satisfy his debts.  I conclude both these potentially disqualifying conditions apply.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concerns arising from Applicant's financial difficulties can be mitigated under certain circumstances.  Under the Directive, &para; E2.A6.1.3.1, it may 
be mitigating where "the behavior was not recent."  Applicant's delinquent debts arose between 1989 and 2002.  However, they remained unpaid until recent 
times, and several are still not completely resolved.  I find Applicant's financial problems are recent.  This mitigating condition does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A6.1.3.2 of the Directive provides that it may be mitigating where the financial difficulty "was an isolated incident."  Applicant's numerous 
delinquent debts arose over many years because of a variety of reasons.  I conclude this mitigating condition does not apply<EM>.</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A6.1.3.3, it may be mitigating where, "[t]he conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)."  Several circumstances beyond his control caused or 
exacerbated Applicant's financial problems.  These include his separation and contested divorce, his injury in an automobile accident and resulting lost wages, 
his mother's illness and subsequent death, several periods of unemployment, and a second automobile causing the destruction of his vehicle.  I find this 
mitigating condition applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Proof that "[t]he person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control," may be mitigating, under &para; E2.A6.1.3.4 of the Directive.  Similarly, it may be mitigating where "[t]he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts."  Directive, &para; E2.A6.1.3.6. Applicant obtained financial counseling through a credit counseling service well before 
the initiation of this action.  He also arranged a debt payment plan and made multiple payments on the plan until his second automobile accident prevented him 
from continuing. Since then he has paid off several delinquent debts and made payments plans with other creditors. His current financial situation demonstrates 
he is capable of continuing the payment plans until the debts are substantially resolved.  The few debts to creditors that remain unresolved (because Applicant is 
unable to locate the account holders) are so minor they do not raise security concerns.  I find his financial problem is under control or is being resolved.  I 
conclude both these mitigating conditions apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept.  Applicant is a mature individual with a lengthy 
history of service to the United States through active duty and reserve military service.  The financial problems at issue arose largely from circumstances 
beyond his control, rather than his own negligence or misconduct.  Significantly, he took action to begin to resolve these debts before the initiation of this 
action.  Even after the automobile accident interfered with his plan, he persisted to the extent possible and resolved several debts.  He obtained his degree and a 
better job, and took advantage of financial counseling. I find he has made significant behavioral changes greatly diminishing the likelihood of a continuation or 
recurrence of his previous financial problems.  I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his history of failing to meet his financial 
obligations and his inability to pay his debts. <STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>
