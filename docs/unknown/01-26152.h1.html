<P>This 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor is delinquent on 11 separate accounts, totaling more than $7,000, and going back as far as 1996.  Despite her 
involvement in the present process, and her now working two jobs, she has not yet resolved, or made payments on, any of the debts.  No mitigation was shown.  
Clearance is denied.  </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On January 4, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2,</P> 
<P>1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons</P> 
<P>why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it</P> 
<P>is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative 
Judge to conduct proceedings and</P> 
<P>determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</P> 
<P>On February 4, 2002, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected</P> 
<P>to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge based on the written record; i.e., without</P> 
<P>a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) to</P> 
<P>Applicant on March 2, 2002.  The FORM includes six exhibits, which have been marked and admitted  as Government Exhibits (GX) 1 - 6.  The Applicant was 
instructed to submit information in response to the FORM within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.  Applicant did not submit a response to the FORM.  The 
matter was assigned to me for resolution on May 22, 2002.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 45-year-old systems support engineer employed by a defense contractor that</P> 
<P>is seeking a security clearance for Applicant (level not specified in the FORM).  In her response to the SOR, which alleges 11 delinquent/past due debts under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Applicant admitted all 11 allegations, with explanations.  After considering the totality of the evidence in the case file, 
including Applicant's response to the SOR, I make the following FINDINGS OF FACT as to each SOR allegation:</P> 
<P>As of February 4, 2002, the date of Applicant's response to the SOR, all of the debts cited as owed by Applicant to Creditors A - K, as alleged in SOR 1.a. - 1.k, 
as incorporated by reference, </P> 
<P>were in fact owed in the amounts stated.  The amounts owed were: 1.a. - $2,914.00; 1.b. - $374.00; </P> 
<P>1.c. - $648.00; 1.d. - $1,306.00; 1.e. - $803.00; 1.f. - $88.00; 1.g. - $658.00; 1.h. - $50.00; 1.i. - $50.00; 1.j. - $37.00.  As of the same date, Applicant's monthly 
income was insufficient to pay on the cited delinquent debts, which exceed $7,000.00.</P> 
<P>Applicant has made efforts to resolve the debts but has been unable to do so, for a variety of reasons, specifically a lack of funds and/or an inability to reach an 
agreement with the creditors.   As to SOR 1.g., Applicant is unhappy with the work done by the creditor/dentist and does not think she is obligated to pay for 
the work.</P> 
<P>In addition some of the debts had been charged off and Applicant believed the creditors were no longer seeking repayment.  As of her response to the SOR, 
dated February 4, 2002, the last word form Applicant, she had not made any repayments on the cited debts and could not make any prediction as to when she 
could pay them off. </P> 
<P>As of January 2002, Applicant was working at one job, at which she received a pay increase, and then obtained a second position.  Both are "full time jobs" 
(Response to SOR (GX 3)).  She was paying off her "essential" bills and hopes to "get caught up on all [her] bills, old and new" (<EM>Id</EM>.).</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant</P> 
<P>in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding</P> 
<P>the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the</P> 
<P>individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)</P> 
<P>the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation</P> 
<P>for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood</P> 
<P>of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2. 1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my 
overall conclusion.</P> 
<P>Because each security case presents its own facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed</P> 
<P>that the factors cited above exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally</P> 
<P>in every case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may 
be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable financial judgment and conduct.</P> 
<P>Considering the evidence as a whole, I find the following specific adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</P> 
<P>GUIDELINE F (Financial Considerations)</P> 
<P><EM>The Concern</EM>: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage</P> 
<P>in illegal acts to generate funds</P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and maybe disqualifying include:</P> 
<P>1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</P> 
<P>3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</P> 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
<P>None that are applicable under the evidence of record.  </P> 
<P>The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related 
to the ultimate question of</P> 
<P>whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination based on the "whole person" concept required by the Directive, the Administrative Judge is not permitted to speculate, but can only draw those 
inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical  </P> 
<P>basis in the evidence of record. In addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make</P> 
<P>critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.</P> 
<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified information is entrusted to civilian workers</P> 
<P>who must be counted on to safeguard classified information and material twenty-four hours a day.</P> 
<P>The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an</P> 
<P>applicant for a security clearance, in his or her private life or connected to work, may be involved</P> 
<P>in conduct that demonstrates poor judgment, untrustworthiness, or unreliability.  These concerns include consideration of the potential, as well as the actual, 
risk that an applicant may deliberately</P> 
<P>or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
<P>An applicant's admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the Government</P> 
<P>of having to prove those allegations. If specific allegations and/or information are denied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the 
initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden (either</P> 
<P>by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and establishes conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then 
shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence</P> 
<P>of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.</P> 
<P>A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the</P> 
<P>Government based upon trust and confidence. As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended,</P> 
<P>at E2.2.2., "any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of national security will be resolved in favor of the 
nation's security."</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P> As of the closing of the record, Applicant has not paid off, or even made any payments on, even the smallest debts cited in the SOR, despite her working two 
jobs and receiving a raise as of February 2002.</P> 
<P>I note the information provided by Applicant in her October 22, 2001 statement (part of GX 3) and in her February 4, 2002 response to the SOR (also part of 
GX 3), reflecting no change in debt status.  In not responding to the FORM, Applicant has lost an opportunity to document any improvements in the status of 
her delinquent debts since February 2002.  As a result, despite the passage of many months since the security clearance eligibility process began, the record does 
not show any resolution of the cited debts, even as to the ones with the smallest amounts owing, all less than $100.00 (SOR 1.f., 1.h., 1.i., and 1.j.).  The debts 
total slightly more than $7,000.00.</P> 
<P>DOHA decisions are not an evaluation of a person's loyalty to the United States but of the risks that result from a person's conduct, if that conduct violates one 
or more of the Guidelines in the Directive.  In the present case, that Guideline deals with financial considerations.  The underlying concern of the guideline is 
that the manner in which an individual incurs debts or how he or she seeks to resolve those debts may show questionable judgment, unreliability, and/or 
untrustworthiness</P> 
<P>This concern that is central to the issues in the present case.  Even if much of the debt was incurred while she was in, or just after she graduated, from college, 
the fact remains that Applicant has not paid off any of the cited debts.  In that regard, while Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 and 2 apply, none of the 
itigating Conditions have been <STRONG>demonstrated</STRONG> to be applicable.  The debts remain recent, they are not an isolated event, and there is no clear indication the 
debts are being resolved or are under control (MC 1, 2, and 5).  In addition while MC 3 might have been applicable in the past, the improvements in Applicant's 
financial situation make it no longer a mitigating factor. </P> 
<P>The fact of the debts cited in the SOR is not disputed, nor is how the debts were incurred.   What is most critical in determining Applicant's security clearance 
eligibility is the present size of the debt load and what she has done to resolve the individual and collective debts.  I have carefully considered all of Applicant's 
explanation for not yet resolving each debt, including her stated intention of eventually resolving the cited debts. </P> 
<P>The fact that a debt has been written off by the creditor (SOR 1.a.) and is no longer being pursued by the creditor, is not necessarily a positive factor for an 
individual who let the debt remain unpaid long enough to reach that point, and it clearly does not demonstrate financial rehabilitation.  </P> 
<P>I have considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and have assessed Applicant's credibility based on the written record.  I 
conclude that the totality of the evidence establishes a case as to all SOR allegations, which in turn establishes a nexus or connection with Applicant's security 
clearance eligibility.  </P> 
<P>The remaining issue is whether Applicant has provided explanation, mitigation and/or extenuation adequate to overcome the negative impact of the 
Government's case.  As discussed above, I conclude Applicant has not yet carried her burden of <STRONG>demonstrating </STRONG>she is financially rehabilitated, and possesses 
the good judgment and reliability required of anyone seeking access to the nation's secrets.  Under these circumstances, the record does not support a 
conclusion  favorable to Applicant at this time.  In the year before Applicant can reapply for a security clearance, she will have the opportunity to finally resolve 
the delinquent debts at issue in the present matter.</P>
