<P>Applicant, a retired police officer, was convicted of attempting to carry a dangerous weapon on an aircraft. Although he pled guilty to the offense, he insists he 
would not have taken the weapon on the aircraft if he had successfully navigated through security. Applicant failed to mitigate criminal conduct security 
concerns. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 1 September 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-14712.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant 
answered the SOR in writing on 11 September 2004 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 27 April 
2005. On 14 June 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 22 June 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 48-year-old procurement technician for a defense contractor. He has been married 25 years and has two adult children, both living at home. In 
2000, after 20 years on a city police force in State 1, he retired and moved to State 2. Applicant was granted an interim clearance on 3 July 2002.<A HREF="03-14712.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>On 18 December 2001, Applicant was scheduled to fly from State 2 to State 3 in order to pickup a truck he had purchased on the internet. When he got dressed 
that morning, he had placed a Delta Dart in his boot. The Delta Dart is a weapon that is eight and one-half inches long and one-half inch in diameter and is 
made of a "super tough material that, when combined with the Dart's sharp point and triangular cross section, accounts for its phenomenal piercing power and 
allowed it to be driven by hand right through a &frac12;" thick piece of leather." Ex. 7. Applicant knew that it was wrong for him to carry the weapon on an aircraft. 
Ex. 2 at 2. At the airport, Applicant saw signs stating it was a crime to have a weapon in his possession. Applicant walked through the magnetometer at the 
airport without incident. He was chosen for random screening and asked to remove his boots. After the scanner completed checking the first boot, Applicant 
told her she wouldn't be happy with what she was going to find in the second boot. In the boot, the screener found the dart. Ex. 4 at 24.</P> 
<P>Applicant was arrested by the local police and detained at a U.S. Marshal's facility for two days. On 20 December 2001, he was arraigned on a charge of 
attempting to carry a dangerous weapon on board an aircraft, pled not guilty, and was released on his own recognizance. His first trial ended in a hung jury. On 
10 July 2002, Applicant entered into a plea agreement with the federal prosecutor. Ex. 3. In exchange for his plea of guilty, Applicant received a sentence that 
included probation for three years, deferred for a period of one year from the date of the offense, 100 hours of community service, and being prohibited from 
flying on commercial airline transportation and carrying or possessing any concealed weapons on his person or in his property. <EM>Id.</EM> at 2-3. After Applicant 
completed the terms of the plea agreement, the court dismissed the indictment with prejudice and vacated the sentence on 19 December 2002. Ex. A. There is 
no evidence that before or after this offense Applicant was ever arrested or charged with any other criminal offense.</P> 
<P>Attempting to carry a dangerous weapon on an aircraft is a violation of 49 U.S.C. &sect; 46505(b)(1), a Class C felony. A conviction for this offense carries a 
maximum sentence of a fine of $250,000 and a prison term of 10 years. Ex. 3 at 1.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was convicted of attempting to carry a dangerous weapon on an aircraft, a felony. SOR &para; 1.a. Applicant admitted the 
allegation in his Answer. A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Directive &para; 
E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant knew he was prohibited from boarding an aircraft with a weapon, but claims not to have known the consequences of his action-that he would be 
committing a crime by doing so-at the time he put the dart in his boot. He suggests he made a cost-benefit analysis by weighing "the known wrongdoing 
against what [he] believed was a risk of some sort of bad event occurring given that it was the holiday season and we were just on the wake of 9/11." Tr. 38. He 
insists he did not know it was criminal until he saw the signs at the security checkpoint in the airport, and that he could not dispose of the weapon or leave the 
security line without arousing suspicions and creating alarm. Tr. 26-29. Applicant also asserts that, once he saw the signs against carrying weapons through 
security, he abandoned his intent to carry the dart on the airplane and would have disposed of it once he got through security and prior to boarding the aircraft. 
<EM>Id.</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find incredible Applicant's testimony that he, a police veteran of 20 years, did not know it was a crime to carry a weapon on an airplane, especially after 9/11. 
He further failed to convince me that he intended to dispose of the weapon if he had made it through airport security without incident.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions constitute evidence of potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline J</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant committed a 
single serious crime-attempting to carry a dangerous weapon on an aircraft. DC E2.A10.1.2.1. Mitigating conditions that might apply to Applicant's case 
include that the criminal behavior was not recent (MC E2.A10.1.3.1), the crime was an isolated event (MC E2.A10.1.3.2), and there is clear evidence of 
successful rehabilitation (MC E2.A10.1.3.6).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although it has been over three years since Applicant was arrested, I find the incident was recent. It was his arrest and subsequent conviction that caused 
DISCO to review his security clearance. Although it has taken more than three years since his arrest to process this case, I am unwilling to conclude the incident 
was not recent. Therefore, MC E2.A10.1.3.1 does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's criminal offense was isolated-there is no evidence of any other offenses either before of after this incident. MC E2.A10.1.3.2 applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is no likelihood Applicant will commit such an offense in the future. He appears to be intelligent and he clearly recognizes his error in attempting to carry 
a dangerous weapon on board the aircraft. But the real issue here is whether Applicant is reliable, trustworthy, and has good judgment. What is most troubling 
to me is Applicant's apparent willingness to take responsibility for his actions while at the same time trying to rationalize his conduct as being innocent-he 
would not have taken the dart on the airplane even if he had successfully navigated security. He knew he was prohibited from carrying a weapn through airport 
security, yet he decided, on a cost-benefit analysis, that it was worth the risk. He considered himself above the rules established to promote the safety of all air 
travelers. Under the circumstances, I am unable to conclude Applicant has shown clear evidence of rehabilitation. MC E2.A10.1.3.6 does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all of the evidence, the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and the adjudicative process factors, I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
