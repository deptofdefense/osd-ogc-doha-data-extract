</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 12, 2004,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR alleged facts 
under Guideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline E (personal conduct) as the reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a written statement, dated September 8, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR and waived a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted a file 
of relevant material (FORM) in support of the Government's preliminary decision, a copy of which was received by Applicant on March 28, 2005.  Applicant 
was afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation by April 27, 2005.  Applicant submitted a letter 
dated March 28, 2005 in response to the FORM.  The case was  assigned to me on May 12, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted the delinquent accounts listed in subparagraphs 1.a.  through 1.m. pertaining to financial matters under Guideline F,  and denied the two 
allegations of Guideline E (subparagraph 2.a. and b.)  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of 
the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a married 40-year-old employee of a federal contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance.  He was employed by this contractor in 2002.<A HREF="04-06050.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  He 
has a history of unpaid debts, that on January 5, 2004, totaled $39,395.00.<A HREF="04-06050.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  His financial difficulties can be traced to his involvement in an automobile accident, 
the death of his mother, and periods of unemployment.<A HREF="04-06050.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  His employment history on his SF 86 shows continuous employment from and after April 19, 1994.<A HREF="04-06050.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>   
He experienced some temporary layoffs and working for a much reduced wage around the 2000 - 2001-time frame.<A HREF="04-06050.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant made no effort to reduce these debts during this period of time.  His income statement showed, after payment of current obligations, a net remainder 
of $1,774.00 per month.<A HREF="04-06050.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular">  His one page response to the FORM listed several proposals to reduce debt but there was no evidence that creditors had accepted 
these proposals.  Nor did the letter contain any evidence showing that any of the listed debts in the SOR had been paid or reduced.<A HREF="04-06050.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant answered "No" to Standard Form 86, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><EM>Question 39. Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 Days</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>.  In the last 7 years, have you ever been over 90 days 
delinquent on any debts?</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="04-06050.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  He denied that these answers were false claiming that he had been pressured to quickly fill out the EPSQ, and not given adequate 
time to complete the questionnaire.<A HREF="04-06050.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant's reasons are not credible.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular">"[No] one has a 'right' to a security clearance."<A HREF="04-06050.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular">  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the authority to...control access to information bearing on 
national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position...that will give that person access to such 
information."<A HREF="04-06050.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular">  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history 
affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom 
from conflicting allegiances and potential coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing use, handling, and protection of classified 
information."<A HREF="04-06050.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular">  Eligibility for a security clearance may be adjudicated using the  security guidelines contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the 
applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or 
presence of rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="04-06050.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular">  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven 
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.<A HREF="04-06050.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="04-06050.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular">  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="04-06050.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has 
access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a 
compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as 
his or his own.  The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for 
access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="04-06050.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial 
security decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security 
clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular">Having considered the SOR allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here 
are those conditions listed under Guideline F (financial considerations) , Directive,&para; E2.A6.1.1. <EM>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of 
having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts</EM>; and Guideline E 
(personal conduct), Directive, &para; E2.A5.1.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information</EM>.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence,  and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular">The Government has established its case under Guideline F.  Failure to pay outstanding financial obligations gives rise to Financial Considerations 
Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>); and FC DC E2A6.1.2.3. (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular">Applicant's bad debts go back as far as 1996.  There is no evidence that there has been any effort to pay down these debts. While Mitigating Condition (FC 
C) E2.A6.1.3.3. (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected emergency, or a death, divorce or separation</EM>) might be applicable, because of the accident, death in the family, and periodic lay offs, some of these 
obligations have been unpaid for a long time.  These are not recent debts.  Applicant made some statement about attempting to resolve these debts with certain 
creditors.  Even if an applicant is sincere that he will make an effort to get these debts paid in the future,  his statement must be weighed in light of the record 
evidence as a whole in deciding whether the applicant is likely to adhere to such a commitment in the future. As a matter of common sense and human 
experience, people do not always successfully adhere to the promise to reform or change their conduct or lifestyle.  I have not had the opportunity to personally 
observe Applicant and evaluate his demeanor or veracity and make a favorable credibility determination. Therefore, I cannot make a favorable determination 
concerning his future intent. No other mitigating factors apply.  I conclude Guideline F against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular">The Government also alleged that Applicant falsely answered  two questions on his security clearance application, by failing to disclose he had debts in arrears 
more than 90 days.    This  false statement comes under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. <EM> (the deliberate 
omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to 
conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award 
fiduciary responsibilities)</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular">.  Applicant explained his answers by saying that he was under pressure from his employer's security representative to finish filling 
out his security questionnaire and he forgot to list his debts that were delinquent.   I do not find this reason persuasive.  A person with the number of unpaid 
debts as Applicant doesn't forget he owes these amounts.  The questions are unambiguous. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or conduct will continue or recur 
in the future.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Regular">Applicant's conduct demonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared personnel.  The government has an interest in examining all relevant and 
material adverse information about an Applicant before making a clearance decision.  The government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse 
information.  Further, an applicant's willingness to report adverse information about himself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent 
security violations or other security concerns in the future, something the government relies on in order to perform damage assessments and limit the 
compromise of classified information. No mitigating conditions are applicable.  I conclude  Guideline E against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
