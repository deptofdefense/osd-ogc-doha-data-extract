<P>In the 1960's, Applicant was involved in four incidents of criminal conduct ending in 1968 when he pled guilty to offenses stemming from a burglary of a TV 
store. He was twice sentenced to one to five years confinement, the second occasion in 1968 when he served about two and one-half years until his discharge 
from prison in April 1971. He has since been a law-abiding citizen and continuously employed. He has worked for the same major defense contractor since 
1984, holding a security clearance without incident since 1985. Under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, the Department of Defense is prohibited from renewing Applicant's 
security clearance based on his two sentences to confinement unless the prohibition is waived by the Secretary of Defense. Applicant's case is meritorious and a 
waiver is recommended. Clearance is revoked.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On May 22, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN> On June 14, 2002, Applicant answered the SOR, and 
he requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</P> 
<P>On August 8,  2002, DOHA assigned this case to me to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. Thereafter, on August 15, 2002, a notice of hearing was 
issued to the parties scheduling the hearing for September 11, 2002, at a location near Applicant's place of employment. </P> 
<P>At the hearing, Department Counsel offered three documentary exhibits admitted without objections; no witnesses were called. Applicant appeared with a 
personal representative, offered his own testimony and that of two witnesses, and offered seven documentary exhibits admitted without objections.</P> 
<P>After adjournment, the record remained open for Applicant to offer additional documentary exhibits. Applicant did so in a timely manner, and, Department 
Counsel having no objections, those documents are marked and admitted into the record as Exhibit H-performance evaluations from September 1984 through 
December 2001. DOHA received the transcript on September 25, 2002, and the record closed on September 30, 2002. </P> 
<P>The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline J for criminal conduct based on Applicant's involvement in four incidents of criminal conduct starting in 
1963 and ending in 1968; the SOR also alleges that Applicant is ineligible for access to classified information under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986--the so-called Smith 
Amendment--based on his 1968 sentence to confinement exceeding one year. In his Answer, Applicant admits to the allegations in SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 
1.b., 1.c., and 1.d., and he requests a hearing to establish the basis for a waiver of the prohibition in 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>PROCEDURAL MATTERS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>After the parties had rested their cases, on my own motion, I moved to amend the SOR by </P> 
<P>amending subparagraph 1.e. (the Smith Amendment allegation) to include reference to subparagraph  1.b. based on Applicant's sentence to confinement 
exceeding one year in 1963.<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> After discussing the proposed amendment with the parties, subparagraph 1.e. was amended. I did so because nothing in the 
statute or the DoD policy guidance stated that the Smith Amendment did not apply to a case where the disqualifying conviction and sentence were subsequently 
vacated and set aside. Subsequently, a few weeks after this case was heard, the DOHA Appeal Board reached a similar conclusion.<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Accordingly, consistent 
with agency caselaw, SOR subparagraph 1.e. is amended to include reference to both subparagraphs 1.b. and 1.d.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions are incorporated into my findings, and after a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and  exhibits, I make the following essential 
findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">1.  Applicant is a 59-year-old widowed man seeking to retain a secret security clearance first granted to him in February 1985. He works as a staff engineer for 
software quality for a major defense contractor with core business areas of systems integration, aeronautics, space, and technology services. He has worked for 
this company since 1984, and his current responsibilities are reviewing, critiquing, and testing software.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">2. Applicant testified during the hearing, and I accept his testimony as credible and true.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">3. In March 1963, when he was 19-years-old, Applicant was arrested for a bad-check offense, auto theft, and carrying a deadly weapon. He pled guilty to the 
bad-check offense in municipal court and was sentenced to one-year probation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">4. In July 1963, Applicant was arrested and charged with burglary (breaking and entering). Thereafter, he was indicted for grand larceny. In October 1963, 
according to a review of court records, he pled guilty and was sentenced to not less than one year, but no more than five years, in the state penitentiary. He was 
released from confinement in March 1965. Subsequently, in October 1966, Applicant's conviction and sentence were vacated and set aside when a state court 
determined that his guilty plea was defective or invalid because he was not fully advised of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">5. Shortly after his release from the penitentiary in March 1965, Applicant, now 21-years-old, was detained by local police after legally crossing the U.S.-Mexican border. He was charged with being drunk, unlawfully carrying a firearm, public intoxication, and vagrancy. On March 23, 1965, he was found guilty 
of being drunk and vagrancy, and he was fined $200. He was on parole at the time, so he was returned to the penitentiary in May 1965 for violating parole. He 
was there for an unknown period until his release that year.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">   6. In August 1968, Applicant and at least one other person, broke into a store and stole some televisions. They used the store's van to transport the stolen 
goods, and, thereafter, they ditched the van in the desert setting the van on fire. Applicant was arrested and charged with burglary, arson, auto theft, and 
embezzlement. In September 1968, the now 25-year-old Applicant pled guilty to burglary and was sentenced to not less than one year, but no more than five 
years, in the same state penitentiary. He was discharged from confinement on April 28, 1971, after serving about two and one-half years. While in confinement, 
Applicant taught electronics, vocational math, trigonometry, and geometry to other prisoners.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">7. After his release from the penitentiary, Applicant took a look at his life and didn't like what he saw. He decided to grow up, settle down, and make something 
of himself. Subsequently, he married in October 1972 and remained married until his wife's unexpected death in May 1998. The marriage produced one child, a 
daughter. His daughter, son-in-law, and their two children live with Applicant, and he provides them financial assistance. A few years after his wife's death, a 
granddaughter was discovered face down in a neighbor's pool after several minutes; she eventually recovered several days later after being placed in an induced 
coma. Following his wife's death and during his granddaughter's near-drowning, Applicant experienced the normal emotions associated with such events, but 
otherwise behaved reasonably and rationally.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  8. In August 1972, about four months after his release from the penitentiary, Applicant was confronted by his former associates who sought to involve him in 
their criminal activities. Applicant declined, and he eventually reported the matter to law-enforcement officials. Subsequently, Applicant worked with the state 
police on an insurance fraud case. The result was four persons were arrested, Applicant testified at trial, and convictions were obtained.<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Applicant also worked 
for a county sheriff's office, he was commissioned a special deputy sheriff in January 1975,<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and he was trained and allowed to carry a firearm for his duties.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">9. Aside from a single two to three month period, Applicant has been continuously employed since his release from confinement in 1971. In September 1984, 
Applicant started work for a company that, through a business merger and acquisition, is now his current employer. Starting as an engineering associate, despite 
not having a college degree, he worked his way up to his current position of staff engineer where he leads others and critiques software for various projects 
routinely  involving classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">10. Applicant is a loyal, reliable, and productive employee with a high-degree of technical competence, and he has received very favorable performance 
evaluations from his current employer.<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> His manager, who has known him since 1985, relies on him for difficult projects as well as to train and mentor new 
employees.<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> One co-worker describes Applicant as "a hard worker," "a digger," "spirited," "detailed," "methodical," and as someone you do not want to audit 
you.<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> On one occasion Applicant discovered errors in software that may have prevented the loss of life or property or both (the F-16 software incident), and on 
another occasion prevented the unauthorized release of certain software to a foreign customer.<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">11. He has held a security clearance without incident since February 1985. The manager of industrial security/facility security officer reviewed the relevant 
records and discovered no negative, adverse, or derogatory information concerning Applicant's safeguarding and handling of classified information, including 
the classified container assigned to Applicant.<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Throughout  his current employment Applicant has worked on projects involving classified information. 
Whenever asked or required, Applicant has revealed his criminal history to employers and the government.<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">12. Applicant is a registered voter. He has lived in the same community since 1984 and at the same address since 1994, the home he and his wife bought. Since 
his release from confinement in 1971, other than a couple of traffic tickets, Applicant has been a law-abiding person.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility. Chief among them is the disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the 
relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline J for criminal conduct,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> with its respective 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant here. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In addition, this case involves application of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 based on Applicant's 1963 and 
1968 convictions and sentences to confinement exceeding one year.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case 
is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence 
standard.<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, an 
applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to overcome the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">case against them.<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In addition, an 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> Under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any reasonable 
doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">regulations, practices, or procedures</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline J. Applicant's four incidents of criminal conduct, 
starting in 1963 and ending with his confinement in 1968, is evidence of a history or pattern of illegal behavior that creates doubt about his security suitability. 
Accordingly, disqualifying condition (DC) a<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> and DC b<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In addition, under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, a person who has been convicted in a federal or state court, including trial by courts-martial, and sentenced to imprisonment 
for a term exceeding one year, will not be granted or have renewed access to classified information. The law applies regardless of the amount of time actually 
served. The only exception is in a meritorious case, the Secretary of Defense may authorize a waiver of the statutory prohibition. The prohibition applies here 
based on Applicant's 1963 and 1968 convictions and sentences to confinement of not less than one year, but no more than five years, in the state penitentiary. 
Accordingly, Applicant is ineligible for access to classified information under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have reviewed the mitigating conditions (MC) under Guideline J and conclude that Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concern. First, the crimes 
occurred between 1963 and 1968, and so, the criminal behavior was not recent, has not recurred, and is mitigated by the passage of time.<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> Second, although 
C b<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> does not apply since Applicant was involved in more than one crime, his criminal behavior can be viewed as isolated in the sense that it took place 
during a five-year period when Applicant was young and dumb, a period he has wisely left behind. Third, he assisted and worked for law enforcement in the 
1970's, and he no longer associates with persons involved in criminal activity. In 1975 he left the state where he had his troubles, and he has been a law-abiding 
and productive citizen since his release from confinement. Accordingly, MC d<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> applies in his favor. Fourth, Applicant has reformed and rehabilitated<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> 
himself since the 1960's as demonstrated by the following examples:</SPAN></P> 
<UL> 
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Continuous and productive employment since his release from confinement in 1971.</SPAN></LI> 
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Successful employment with a defense contractor since 1984.</SPAN></LI> 
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Despite his criminal history, possessing a security clearance since 1985 without a single negative, adverse, or derogatory incident.</SPAN></LI> 
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Living in the same community since 1984; a homeowner since 1994.</SPAN></LI> 
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Married for more than 25-years, raised a daughter, and currently providing financial assistance to his daughter, son-in-law, and two grandchildren.</SPAN></LI> 
</UL> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">These, and other facts and circumstances evident in the record, are clear evidence of successful  rehabilitation.<A HREF="01-04676.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> These circumstances are also evidence of a 
self-reliant, mature, steady, responsible, and trustworthy individual.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">To sum up under Guideline J, the record shows Applicant was involved in criminal conduct as a young man in the 1960's. More than three decades have since 
passed without recurrence, and I assess the likelihood of additional criminal conduct as remote. Accordingly, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">absent the prohibition in 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, I would 
decide Guideline J for the Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>
