<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant has a history of recurrent use and purchases of illegal substances (primarily
marijuana), much of which occurred while he held a security clearance.  Because he continues to use
marijuana, the smith Amendment's (10 U.S.C. Sec. 986) mandatory preclusion from holding a
security clearance is applicable.  Applicant's drug activities are compounded by his repeated
omissions and understatements of his drug involvement in security clearance applications (SF-86s)
in 1985, 1989 and 2000, and DSS interviews, which are not mitigated.  Only his child cruelty and
battery arrests are considered extenuated and mitigated by evidence of successful rehabilitation. 
Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	On November17, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could
not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral
to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or
revoked.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant responded to the SOR on December 15, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case
was assigned to me on February 5, 2004, and was scheduled for hearing on March 5, 2004. A hearing
was convened as scheduled for the purpose of considering whether it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the
Government's case consisted of 12 exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and eight
exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on March 17, 2004.</SPAN></P>

allegation to conform with Applicant's hearing testimony that he has continued using marijuana up
to the day preceding the hearing (R.T., at 74-84).  Department Counsel's proposed amendment added
two subparagraphs: 1.g to allege that Applicant continues to use marijuana in 2003 and 2004, and
as recently as March 4, 2004, and 1.h to allege that as a result of Applicant's current drug use, he is
barred from holding a security clearance by virtue of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 986 (sometimes referred to as
the Smith Amendment).  There being no objection from Applicant, and good cause being shown, the
Government's proposed amendment to the SOR was granted.  Permitted to respond to respond to
the amendment, Applicant admitted the allegations covered by newly added subparagraphs 1.g and
1.h.</SPAN></P>

him the opportunity to supplement the record with reports concerning his daughter's ungovernability
charges.  There being no objection from the Government, and good cause being demonstrated,
Applicant was granted nine days to supplement the record.  Department Counsel was afforded ten
days to respond.  Applicant failed to supplement the record within the time permitted. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations: He denied falsifying

SF-86 omissions, Applicant claimed confusion over the questions dealing with counseling and

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER>
</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant is a 48-year-old launch service mechanic for a defense contractor who seeks a
security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are
incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings
follow.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was introduced to marijuana in high school around 1970.  He was about 15 or 16
at the time and smoked it almost daily: sometimes alone, and on other occasions with friends.  He
continued using marijuana during his Navy enlistment (between 1975 and 1979).   As a navy enlistee
he earned the rank of petty officer third class and held a security clearance.  He continued using
marijuana with friends after his discharge from the Navy and enrollment in college, usually weekly.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant married W  in 1984, who bore him two children (A, his eldest daughter and B, his
youngest daughter).  Applicant also gained a stepson (C) from W's first marriage.  For the first five
years of his marriage he quit using illegal drugs altogether.  However, he resumed his use of
marijuana in 1989 and has continued using it on a regular basis ever since. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	With his current employer, he was asked to submit to random drug screens.  In a random drug
screen conducted in July 1998 he failed the test, testing positive for marijuana.  As the result of his
negative drug test, he sought substance counseling assistance from his employees assistance
program.  The program referred him for substance abuse counseling, which he received from August
1998 through September 1998.   During his two months of counseling he submitted to bi-weekly
drug testing (five altogether).  His program counselors  credited him with negative tests in each of
the five tests he submitted to during his period of treatment.  Urged by his counselors to enroll in
either Narcotics Anonymous (NA) or Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Applicant declined.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant returned to substance abuse counseling in February 2002 for relapse prevention
(ex. 6) following his return to marijuana smoking.  He attended weekly drug counseling sessions as
required by the program's two-month course and received a favorable prognosis at discharge.  His
cessation from marijuana use that followed his completion of this program was brief: He soon
returned to marijuana use, notwithstanding his possession of a security clearance.  He returned to
substance abuse counseling for a third session, however, after testing positive for marijuana in a
company-administered random drug test in September 2002.  Again, he received a positive prognosis
from his counselors (<EM>see</EM> ex. 7).  And as before, he returned to periodic marijuana use.  </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant tested negative for marijuana several years later in a conducted random drug screen
by his employer.  At this time, he continued to hold a security clearance.  Despite holding a
clearance, he has been unable to cease using marijuana and tested positive for marijuana in a
randomly administered drug test in November 2002.  Since testing positive for marijuana in 2002,
Applicant has used marijuana off and on three to four times a week   He did test negative for
marijuana in a randomly conducted drug test in April 2003 (<EM>see</EM> ex. B), but he has continued his on-again, off-again use of the substance since this negative test.  His acknowledged last use of 
marijuana was the day before the hearing (<EM>i.e., </EM>on March 4, 2004). </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Besides marijuana, Applicant experimented with other illegal drugs in high school: hash
(1971 to 1974), speed (PCP) from 1971 to 1974, and LSD from 1971 to 1974.  He tried cocaine as
well  following his discharge from the Navy in 1979: every two to three weeks between 1979 and
1984 (purchasing small quantities for his own use).  He assures he has not used any of these other
drugs after 1984; his assurances are accepted.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Following Applicant's divorce from W in 1994, W's stepson (C) continued living with him
for awhile (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3; R.T., at 35-36).  On one occasion in September 1995, C (aged 16 at the time)
used foul language around Applicant  and behaved badly.  After admonishing C that he could either
live by Applicant's rules or cease living in Applicant's home, Applicant directed C to leave his
home.  C then called the police who informed Applicant that he either must accept parental
responsibility for C or face arrest.  Applicant, in turn, was arrested.  When the police heard
Applicant's story, though, they promptly released him from custody on his own recognizance.  The
charges were then dropped.  </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant was arrested a second time in March 2001: this time for battery-touch or strike
domestic violence (a misdemeanor 1<SUP>st</SUP> degree).  Applicant's daughter (A) had been arguing with
Applicant, and when the argument became increasingly intense, Applicant slapped her face with an
open hand.  At Applicant's urging, A reported the incident to her school authorities the following
day.  Applicant, in turn, was arrested the next day on child abuse charges and released on his own
recognizance.  Upon being court-ordered to attend parenting and anger management classes, these
charges, too, were dropped.  Applicant is credited with completing his court-ordered parenting and
anger management classes, along with his eldest daughter (A), who also received therapy (<EM>see</EM> ex.
A).  Applicant's treatment counselor described him as a very diligent and motivated  participant in
the therapy sessions he attended between May and September 2001.  She assigned an initial
diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder, with Anxiety and credited him with excellent progress in a short
time frame in the working goal of reuniting him with his eldest daughter (A).  By September
Applicant and his family were reunited and no longer required therapy.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Asked to complete a Personnel Security Questionnaire (SF-86) in July 1985, Applicant
acknowledged prior marijuana use, but only on an occasional basis: maybe a total of 20 to 25 times
in his life, with a last use in May 1984 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 15).  He assured he had no intention of smoking
marijuana in the future, given his Christian beliefs.  In limiting his drug use history, he omitted his 
his experimentation with other illegal substances.  Inferences of knowing and wilful falsification are
drawn against Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant was interviewed several months later (in October 1985) by a DSS agent (Agent
A).  In the signed, sworn statement he gave Agent A he admitted to experimenting with other drugs
between 1971 and 1984, including cocaine, which he used every two to three weeks between 1979
and 1984 and purchased enough to meet his personal needs.  In this statement he reaffirmed his
intention to abstain from any future drug use (<EM>see</EM> ex. 14).  </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	As a part of his clearance update in 1989, Applicant was required to complete another SF-86. 
In the SF-86 he executed in August 1989, he acknowledged his marijuana use and small quantity
purchases in high school, but omitted any mention of his marijuana use between 1975 and 1984, or
his experimentation with other illegal substances between 1971 and 1984 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 13).  Inferences
of knowing and wilful falsification are drawn against Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	As a part of another clearance update, Applicant completed an SF-86 in July 2000.  In this
SF-86, he omitted the substance abuse counseling he received in 1998.  He attributed the omission
to an erroneous assumption in the question: Question 19 referred to company-mandated counseling
for policy requirements and not the kind of voluntary counseling he received in 1998.   Question 19,
however, does not distinguish between voluntary and involuntary counseling and calls for
information about his drug abuse counseling that could be reasonably expected to expose his drug-related omissions.  Considering all of the circumstances, including his very favorable character
references on issues of overall honesty, Applicant's claims simply lack the plausibility necessary to
enable him to avert inferences of knowing and wilful concealment. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	In the same July 2000 SF-86, Applicant omitted his 1995  arrest.  He attributes his omission
to his misunderstanding of question 26 of the July 2000 SF-86 (<EM>viz., </EM>he believed the question called
for arrests leading to convictions, which his did not).  His claims are complicated somewhat by his
drug and counseling omissions. Were these his only omissions, his claims of misunderstanding might
find acceptance in light of the favorable impressions he has fostered with his coworkers concerning
his overall honesty.  With his credibility in doubt from his other omissions and his job and security
clearance inferentially affected by compounding positive disclosures of his 1995 arrest, he cannot
avert inferences  his omission of his 1995 arrest was made knowingly and wilfully out of concern
for his job and clearance  in considering all of the surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	In a follow-up interview with DSS Agent B in January 2002, Applicant confirmed his 1998
counseling, as well as his1995 and 2001 arrests.  It is not clear whether or not he was confronted
with information pertaining to his counseling and arrests.  At the same time, he claimed to have
avoided any drug use (marijuana included) after December 1999 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3). In so stating, he
concealed his continuing use of marijuana after December 1999.  His omissions were made
knowingly and wilfully to maintain consistency with his prior omissions and minimize any risks to
his job or security clearance.  Several months later (in April 2002), Applicant called Agent B back
and arranged for another interview to correct his drug-related omissions (R.T., at 71-73).  In his
arranged April 2002 DSS interview, Applicant voluntarily supplied the correct details of his
marijuana history without any prompting from the interviewing agent (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2): He admitted to
using marijuana on several occasions since December 1999. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant is highly regarded by his work colleagues who characterize him as honest and
trustworthy.  He is described by colleagues as being very focused and dedicated and is credited with
playing a vital role in his company's successful defense projects (<EM>see</EM> exs. C and D).  He has received
numerous commendations and certificates of appreciation in recognition of his good work for his
employer (<EM>compare </EM>exs. E and F).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Under the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's
request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make
a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of
an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and
materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those
inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the
Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged
in the SOR and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing on the
applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of materiality,
however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate the applicant has actually
mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. 
Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks an applicant may deliberately or
inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P>

to include both current use and use while holding a security clearance.  Actions raising security
concerns also include falsification of security clearance applications and information furnished DSS
agents in arranged interviews and arrests on allegations of child cruelty on his daughter and step son. 
These actions raise security concerns over his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required to
access him to classified information.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	<STRONG>Applicant's drug abuse history and Smith Amendment application</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>	</STRONG>Over a 34-year period, Applicant has experimented with various kinds of illegal drugs but
has concentrated his use and purchases of illegal substances on marijuana.  Despite positive random
drug screens, ensuing counseling, varying periods of short-term abstinence and expressed intentions
not to use illicit drugs in the future, he has consistently returned to recurrent marijuana abuse.  He
currently uses marijuana and reports a last use of the day before the hearing.  With so many returns
to drug use after commitments to</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> abstain, and lacking in any reliable track history of illicit drug
activity (considering the misleading  and contradictory accounts he has provided DSS over a series
of investigations), too much doubt and uncertainty exist to make safe predictable judgments about
his ability to avoid recurrent drug involvement. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	On the strength of the evidence presented, several disqualifying conditions of the
Adjudicative Guidelines for drug abuse are applicable: DC 1 (any drug abuse), DC 2 (illegal drug
possession, including purchases) and DC 5 (failure to successfully complete a drug treatment
Program).  While Applicant appeared to make some initial progress with his drug counseling, his 
returns to drug use preclude him from characterizing his counseling as successful.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Because of the Smith Amendment's mandatory preclusion of clearance eligibility for anyone
determined to be an illegal drug user (<EM>see</EM> 10 U.S.C. Sec. 986(c)(2), Applicant, by virtue of his
current illegal use of marijuana, is barred from continued access to classified information without
regard to any extenuating or mitigating circumstances that might be found in his behalf.  Further,
considering his long history of substance abuse, and recurrent use of marijuana while holding a
security clearance and even despite past promises to abstain, considerable time in demonstrated
abstinence would be required  without the mandatory preclusive effects of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 986 (c)(2). 
Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by Guideline H.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Falsification and rules violation issues</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Potentially serious and difficult  to reconcile with the trust and reliability requirements for
holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of Applicant's drug use omissions in
each of his SF-86s, as well as in his DSS interviews that followed each of his clearance application
submissions.  So much trust is imposed on persons cleared to see classified information that 
tolerances for incidents of trust betrayal are necessarily small.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	By omitting his earlier experimentation with other drugs and understating  his past marijuana
use in each of his clearance applications, and ensuing DSS interviews, Applicant concealed
materially important background information needed for the government to properly process and
evaluate his security updates.  He makes no claim of misunderstanding the questions, which were
posed in a straightforward way in the questionnaire.  Applicant's omissions reflect concerns about
how disclosure of the adverse information would impact on his employment and clearance:
understandable certainly, but historically considered by our Appeal Board to be insufficient to avert
drawn conclusions of knowing and wilful concealment.  In the same vein, his failure to disclose his
receipt of substance abuse counseling and his 1995 arrest until after he was confronted with the same
in ensuing DSS interviews reflect concerted desire to avert unfavorable information about himself
that might conceivably impact adversely on his job and security clearance, which he valued a great
deal.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant's omissions were knowing, deliberate, and material to a determination about his
clearance suitability.  They invite application of Disqualifying Conditions (DC) for personal conduct
of the Adjudicative Guidelines: DC 2 (falsification of a security questionnaire) and DC 3 (providing
false information to an investigator).</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Mitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with,  since he failed to take advantage of repeated
opportunities in DSS interviews (dating to 1985) to disclose the extent of his historical involvement
in illegal drugs.  Not until he voluntarily disclosed his drug use history in belated DSS interview in
November 2002 (over two years following his submission of a falsified SF-86) did he correct his
prior omissions.  Over the years, the Appeal Board has been very consistent in its finding the use of
Mitigating Condition (MC) 2 of the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal conduct (isolated,
corrected falsification) to be unavailable to applicants seeking mitigation by treating the omission
as isolated.   Similarly, the Appeal Board has denied applicants availability of MC 3 (prompt, good
faith disclosure) in circumstances (as here) where the applicant has failed to take advantage of an
earlier DSS interview opportunity.  <EM>Compare </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0289 (January 1998) with DISCR
Case No. 93-1390 (January 1995).  Applicant, accordingly, may not take advantage of either MC 2
(isolated omissions) or MC 3 (prompt, good faith correction of the falsification) of the Adjudicative
Guidelines for personal conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	There can be no doubt but that Applicant has inspired confidence and trust among his defense
contractor supervisor and co-workers.  But in the face of his repeated acts of omission, his favorable
character evidence alone is not enough to absorb security concerns extant with the Government over
his failure to be truthful through both his SF-86 submissions and initial DSS interviews in1985 and
January 2002.  Mitigation is further weakened by the qualifications expressed by most of his
character witnesses: lack of awareness of the extent of Applicant's drug use and his record of
omissions of material information about his drug involvement. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant's continued use of marijuana while holding a security clearance also raises
personal conduct concerns.  His knowing use of drugs while holding a clearance was undertaken
knowingly and wilfully and reflects persistent  rules violations.  The government may invoke DC </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">5 (pattern of rules violations) in connection with his continued use of marijuana long after he had
been granted a security clearance.  With his use of marijuana not yet abated, he may not take
advantage of any of the mitigating conditions covered by Guideline E.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Considering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available guidelines in the
Directive (inclusive of the E.2.2 factors), unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paras.
2.a through 2.i of Guideline E.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>	Criminal coverage of falsification issues</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	That none of Applicant's SF-86 and DSS interview omissions resulted in formal charges and
adjudication against Applicant does not mean that the falsification issues may not be raised and
considered anew in a clearance proceeding such as the present.  Our Appeal Board has repeatedly
stated that the government can prove applicant engagement in criminal conduct, even in the absence
of a criminal conviction.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 94-1213 (June 7, 1996).   Accordingly, two of the
disqualifying conditions of the Adjudication Guidelines for criminal conduct may be invoked: DC
1 (criminal conduct regardless of whether the person was formally charged) and DC 2 (a single
serious crime or multiple lesser offenses).</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Unlike Guideline E-covered omissions, Guideline J is designed to afford more recognition
to an applicant's overall judgment and reliability history.  Still, an applicant must meet the
requirements of at least some of the mitigation conditions if he is to successfully mitigate its related
falsification parameters under 18 U.S.C. Section 1001. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's belated coming forward with his full disclosure of his illegal drug history until
his last DSS interview represented a positive shift in his attitude about withholding drug involvement
information that are inferentially attributed to concerns over placing his job and clearance at risk by
disclosing his full drug use record.  His meritorious work record merits consideration, too, in
weighing the extent of his exhibited rehabilitation.   Given his considerable history of withholding
his drug activity in clearance applications and a prior DSS interview, however, his disclosure, while
commendable,  is not enough to meet the mitigation requirement of evidenced clear rehabilitation
to entitle him to take advantage of MC 6 (clear evidence of successful rehabilitation) of the
Adjudication Guidelines at this time.  More time is needed before Applicant is in a position to make
the case his rehabilitation efforts are sufficient to mitigate the criminally-related features of his drug
use omissions.  Based on a full review of the evidence and drawn inferences from the developed
record, unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraph 2.c. of Guideline J as well.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	While the cruelty allegations associated with his 1995 and 2001 arrests raise some security
concerns they are adequately extenuated by Applicant's explanations, and mitigated by the
counseling he underwent in 2001 at the court's direction, and the rehabilitation he has since
demonstrated (to include the reunification of his family).  Applicant is entitled to the mitigation
benefits of MC 6 (clear evidence of rehabilitation) as to the allegations concerning his respective
arrests in 1995 and 2001.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b
of Guideline J.</SPAN></P>
