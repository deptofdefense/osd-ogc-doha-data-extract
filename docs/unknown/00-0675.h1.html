<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 26, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA 
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or 
revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on or about August 27, 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) on October 5, 2001.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or 
mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on October 19, 2001, and Applicant's reply was received on or 
about November 16, 2001.  The case was received by the undersigned for resolution on January 2, 2002.  The issue raised here is whether the 
Applicant's admitted criminal conduct militates against the granting of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of Relevant Material and Applicant's Response.  The 
Applicant is 44 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.~1.d and 1.l.  In March of 1976, the Applicant was arrested for, and subsequently found guilty of, Disorderly conduct (Item 6 at pages 1~2).  
Three year later, in <STRONG>March of 1979</STRONG>, the Applicant was arrested for, charged with, and subsequently found guilty of Possession of a Controlled 
Drug (Marijuana) with Intent to Distribute, a <STRONG>felony</STRONG>, and of Possession of a Controlled Drug (Marijuana), a misdemeanor (Item 6 at page 2, and 
Item 7).  As a result of this conviction, the Applicant was sentenced to 5 years in prison, which was suspended (<EM>id</EM>).  Three years later, in 
<STRONG>September 1982</STRONG>, the Applicant was arrested for, charged with, and subsequently found guilty of Conspiracy to Commit a Felony, also a <STRONG>felony</STRONG> 
(Item 5 at page 2, Item 6 at pages 2~3, and Item 8).  As a result of this second felony conviction, he was again sentenced to 5 years in prison, 
which was suspended (<EM>id</EM>).  Three months later in <STRONG>December of 1982</STRONG>, while awaiting trial for the September 1982 arrest, the Applicant was 
arrested for, charged with, and subsequently found guilty of Receiving Stolen Property, a <STRONG>felony</STRONG> (Item 6 at page 3, and Item 9).  As a result of this 
third felony conviction, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, which was also suspended, but he was placed on probation for 10 years (<EM>id</EM>).  
Under 10 U.S.C. Section 986, the Applicant is disqualified from having his security clearance granted or renewed as a result of the three felony 
convictions and sentences of more than one year.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e.~1.j.  Subsequent to his felony convictions, the Applicant's Criminal Conduct is the following: <STRONG>December 1984</STRONG>, Urinating in Public, a 
misdemeanor, for which he was fined (Item 6 at pages 3~4); <STRONG>March 1985</STRONG>, Driving Under the Influence (DUI), for which he was found guilty, 
fined, and sentenced to 30 days in jail, which was suspended (Item 6 at page 4); <STRONG>April 1986</STRONG>, Drinking in Public, for which he was fined (<EM>id</EM>); <STRONG>April 
1987</STRONG>, Frequenting for Lewdness, a misdemeanor, for which he was fined (Item 6 at pages 4~5); <STRONG>January 1993</STRONG>, Lewd and Lascivious Cohabit, 
for which he was fined (Item 6 at page 5); <STRONG>May 1994</STRONG>, Drunk in Public/Profanity-General and Possession of Marijuana, for which he was fined 
(Item 5 at page 2, and Item 6 at page 5);and <STRONG>July 1998</STRONG>, Disorderly Conduct, for which he was fined, sentenced to six months in jail, which was 
also suspended(Item 6 at pages 5~6).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant offers a November 1998 Letter of Appreciation (Applicant's Exhibit (AppX 4), and 10 Letters of Reference (AppXs 5~14) on his 
behalf.  The Letters of Reference are from those with whom the Applicant works.  They are all laudatory as to the Applicant's work ethic and 
trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; 
which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in every case according 
to the pertinent criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the 
Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, 
it should not be assumed that these conditions exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to 
evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Criminal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Conviction in a Federal or State court . . . of a crime and sentence to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the 
relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the 
consequence involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of 
record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence that are speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline J (criminal conduct); which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively 
safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that 
the past adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all 
times and in all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law, there then exists the possibility that an applicant may 
demonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has a long and fairly recent history of past criminal conduct; and as such, this Decision is made without reference to 10 U.S.C 
Section 986.  This history is evidenced by three felony convictions from 1979~1982, two misdemeanor convictions, one in 1985 and the other in 
1998, and an additional five citations from 1984~1994.  After his last felony conviction, the Applicant was placed on probation for 10 years.  
During this 10 year probationary period, the Applicant was cited and fined three times, and also had a misdemeanor conviction for DUI.  Although 
the Applicant's last misdemeanor conviction, for Disorderly Conduct, was more than three years ago, it also can not be viewed in isolation, in light 
of the Applicant's extensive past criminal record.  Despite the laudatory comments of those with whom the Applicant works, his is clearly not a 
stellar, post felony conviction, record.  Rather it calls into question the Applicant's judgement, reliability and trustworthiness.  Guideline J is 
therefore found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his criminal conduct.  The Applicant has thus not met 
the mitigating conditions of Guideline J, and of Section F.3. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under 
Guideline J.</SPAN></P>
