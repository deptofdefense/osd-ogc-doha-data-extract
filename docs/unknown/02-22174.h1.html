<P>Fifty-four-year old Applicant has a lengthy history of criminal conduct (substance abuse in 1967-80, 1990), drug-related arrests (1977 and 1979), and an arrest 
for theft (1999).  He also has a lengthy history of personal conduct involving questionable judgment and untrustworthiness, including lying on his security 
clearance application.  One of his drug-related arrests resulted in a sentence in part, to confinement for five years, but the sentence was altered to confinement 
for a period of six months, and the remainder of imprisonment was suspended.  Applicant has failed to mitigate the criminal conduct or personal conduct 
concerns.  Moreover, the application of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 disqualifies him from eligibility for a security clearance.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 7, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn, written answer, dated September 2, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to, and 
received by, me on November 20, 2003.  A notice of hearing was initially issued on November 20, 2003, scheduling the hearing for December 16, 2003, but it 
was subsequently cancelled.  Another notice of hearing was issued on February 23, 2004, and the hearing was held before me on March 16, 2004.  During the 
hearing, 13 government exhibits, two Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of three Applicant witnesses (including the Applicant) were received.  The 
transcript (Tr.) was received on March 22, 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>During the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend subparagraphs 1.b. and 2.f. of the SOR.  Specifically, he sought to amend subparagraph 1.b. thereof, 
to conform to the expected evidence and correct a typing error, by deleting the words "Baton Rouge" from the second line of the first sentence and substituting 
therefor the words "Washington D.C.," and by deleting the words "Washington D.C." from the third line of the first sentence and substituting therefor the 
words "Baton Rouge."<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  He also sought to amend subparagraph 2.f. thereof to correct typing errors, by deleting the designation "2.e." on the seventh line of the 
subparagraph and substituting therefor the designation "2.c.; and by deleting the designation "2.f." on the eighth line of the subparagraph and substituting 
therefor the designation "2.e."<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  There being no objection by Applicant, I granted the motions.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.) pertaining to criminal conduct under Guideline J as well as the factual 
allegations (subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.i.) pertaining to personal conduct under Guideline E.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance the level of which has not been revealed.  He previously held 
a SECRET security clearance as early as 1970.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a lengthy history of criminal conduct and personal conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and lack of candor.  
In addition, he was a substance abuser who purchased, possessed, used, sold, and distributed marijuana; and purchased, possessed, and used hashish.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In 1967, when he was about 18 years old, Applicant started what eventually became a lengthy period of illegal substance abuse when he experimented with 
marijuana.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  In 1968, he was arrested after breaking into a closed gas station and stealing two bags of potato chips.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  The judge offered him two options: (1) 
entering military service or (2) continuing the prosecution.  Applicant chose military service.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  In 1975, while visiting friends, Applicant was arrested and 
charged with the purchase and sale of marijuana.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  While he was sentenced to probation for three years, the probation was terminated in 1977.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Two years later, in 1979, for a cash payment of $1,000.00, Applicant agreed to fly to another state to return with a motor home which he had reason to believe 
had marijuana aboard.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  In fact, there were 2,000 pounds of marijuana in the vehicle.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  He was arrested by Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) 
agents<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> and charged with conspiracy to sell marijuana and possession with intent to distribute controlled dangerous substances, marijuana.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  After much 
legal maneuvering involving the various co-defendants, including Applicant, he was convicted and sentenced in August 1980.  On the conspiracy charge, he 
was sentenced to confinement for six months, confinement for 60 months (suspended), and fined $3,000.00.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  The sentence was split--a term not otherwise 
explained-- and he was ordered to serve confinement for six months, and placed on probation for five years.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  On the sale charge, he was sentenced to 
confinement for five years and fined $5,000.00.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  On September 8, 1980, Applicant was identified as a "5 years special condition defendant"--once again a 
term not otherwise explained--and the sentence was altered to confinement for a period of six months, the remainder of imprisonment was suspended, he was 
placed on probation for five years, and fined $5,000.00.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> Applicant entered a federal prison in October 1982,<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> and was released in February 1983.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's initial period of substance abuse stopped shortly after his arrest in 1979, and he remained drug free for the next 10 years.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  However, in September 
1990, while on company business as a government contractor in another country, and while holding a security clearance, Applicant resumed his substance abuse 
by purchasing and smoking hashish.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  A co-worker observed him and reported the incident to the employer.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  As a result, he was suspended for three days 
without pay, and placed on probation for one year.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  Applicant contends he has abstained from further substance abuse since 1990,<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> and there is no 
government evidence to rebut his contention.</P> 
 
<P>In December 1985, Applicant was arrested for driving while under the influence (DUI).<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  He took field sobriety tests but refused to take a breathalyzer.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  In 
April 1987, after initially contesting the case, upon his plea, Applicant was convicted.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  However, before sentencing, the finding of guilty was stricken and 
Applicant was placed on supervised probation for 18 months with special conditions.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In April 1992, during a security clearance investigation into Applicant's background, he was asked to undergo a polygraph examination, but he declined to do 
so.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In November 1997, Applicant, a senior electronics technician, was placed on disciplinary suspension by his employer for a pattern of attendance infractions,<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> 
and, effective January 1, 1998, because of continuing infractions, his employment was terminated despite his treatment for an illness.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  He spent the next 10 
months unemployed.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant found employment as a sales person with a national home improvement retail chain in October 1998, but in March 1999, he failed to clock out for 
lunch and his employment was terminated.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>  He remained unemployed for two more months.</P> 
 
<P>In May 1999, Applicant found employment with a local hardware chain which had already filed for bankruptcy.  During a rainy day in July or August 1999, he 
took a raincoat without paying for it claiming he had intended to pay for it but forgot to do so.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A>  A security guard found the item in his bag, and Applicant's 
employment was terminated the following day.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In August 1999, Applicant stole six to eight packs of cigarettes from a national retail/grocery store.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A>  He received a police citation charging him with theft 
under $300.00.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A>  Applicant attributed</P> 
 
<P>his actions to emotional problems stemming from financial difficulties.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A>  He retained an attorney and agreed to pay restitution.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A>  The records were 
subsequently expunged pursuant to court order.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 31, 1999, Applicant completed his SF 86,<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A> and in response to an inquiry pertaining to ever being fired from a job, or leaving a job following 
allegations of misconduct or unfavorable performance, etc.,<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> he acknowledged two such instances as described above.<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A>  He did not, however, mention the 
incident of one or two months earlier when he was terminated for stealing a raincoat.  He certified his response was true, complete, and accurate.  It was false in 
that he had concealed and omitted his most recent incident.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the same SF 86, in response to an inquiry pertaining to ever being charged with or convicted of any felony offenses,<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A> Applicant acknowledged one such 
offense which he described as "possession," and indicated he was "sentenced."<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A>  He did not, however, mention </SPAN>conspiracy to sell marijuana and possession 
"with intent to distribute controlled dangerous substances, marijuana." <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He certified his response was true, complete, and accurate.  It was false.  He had lied,

</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
 
<P>An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the 
Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the  potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct - Guideline J: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct - Guideline E: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to each of the 
adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below<STRONG>.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On June 7, 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a Memorandum, <EM>Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances 
as Mandated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001</EM>.  The memorandum provides policy guidance for the 
implementation of Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United States 
Code, to add a new section (10 U.S.C. &sect; 986) that precludes the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense under specific 
circumstances.  The situation described above involves one of those specific circumstances.</P> 
 
<P>The statutory mandate applies to any DoD officer or employee, officer, director, or employee of a DoD contractor, or member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or 
arine Corps on active duty or in an active status, who is under consideration for the issuance or continuation of eligibility for access to classified information 
and who falls under one or more of the following provisions of the statute:</P> 
 
<P>(1) has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;</P> 
 
<P>(2) is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance (as defined in Section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802));</P> 
 
<P>(3) is mentally incompetent, as determined by a mental health professional approved by the Department of Defense; or</P> 
 
<P>(4) has been discharged or dismissed from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions.</P> 
 
<P>The statute also "provides that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Military Departments concerned may authorize a waiver of the prohibitions 
concerning convictions, dismissals and dishonorable discharges from the armed forces in meritorious cases."</P> 
 
<P>Implementing guidance attached to the memorandum indicates that provision 1, described above, "disqualifies persons with convictions in both State and 
Federal courts, including UCMJ offenses, with sentences imposed of <EM>more than </EM>one year, regardless of the amount of time actually served."</P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="02-22174.h1.html#N_55_"><SUP> (55)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest." For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere 
speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government meets 
its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to 
overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the government must be 
able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case under Guideline J.  By his own admission, Applicant was involved in substantial criminal activity between 1967 and 
1999, as described above, with some of that activity resulting in arrests and various court-ordered punishment.  During that period, he has abused drugs, 
attempted to distribute drugs, and stole items.  Obviously, the most serious of all of his criminal conduct occurred in 1979 when he knowingly became a "mule" 
in the illegal distribution of marijuana.  On the conspiracy charge, Applicant was, in part, sentenced to confinement for six months and confinement for 60 
months (suspended).  The sentence was subsequently split and he was ordered to serve confinement for six months and placed on probation for five years.  On 
the sale charge, he was sentenced, in part, to confinement for five years.  Applicant was eventually identified as a "5 years special condition defendant," and the 
sentence was altered to confinement for a period of six months, the remainder of imprisonment was suspended, he was placed on probation for five years, and 
fined $5,000.00.  Applicant's criminal conduct clearly falls within Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>allegations or 
admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>), CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a single serious crime or multiple lesser 
offenses</EM>), and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.3. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term 
exceeding one year</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The frequency of Applicant's criminal conduct has been such that I fail to see any appreciable period during which he has adhered to the accepted norms of 
society.  The chronology of events is lengthy for his illegal substance abuse started in 1967 and continued until shortly after his arrest in 1979.  It continued 
after his 1975 arrest as well as during the period in which he held a security clearance.  After 10 years of abstinence, Applicant resumed his substance abuse in 
1990.  Despite incarceration in 1982-83, he consumed alcohol to excess and was arrested for DUI in 1985.  And finally, in 1999, Applicant was arrested for 
stealing cigarettes.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">It is of substantial concern that Applicant had the opportunity to clean up his act following his 1976 arrest and subsequent probation, or even 
in 1983 when he was released from prison, or after he had been granted a security clearance, but in each instance he failed to seize the opportunity to do so</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">It has been approximately five years since his most recent criminal conduct--the theft of cigarettes.  Since then, Applicant has not been involved in any 
additional criminal conduct.  Those facts would seem to activate Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the criminal behavior was 
not recent</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has been afforded several opportunities to redirect his life.  After each arrest or conviction, he was either punished or given a second 
chance with probation.  However, leniency by the authorities seemingly only facilitated more misconduct or criminal conduct.  In this instance, while there is no 
evidence of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">criminal conduct since 1999, there is also insufficient clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.  The absence of such evidence negates CC MC 
E2.A10.1.3.6. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Some of Applicant's criminal conduct also falls within 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">He was convicted in a federal court of two crimes and sentenced to terms which 
obviously exceed the one year period envisioned in the law.  On the conspiracy charge, Applicant was, in part, sentenced to confinement for six months and 
confinement for 60 months (suspended).  The sentence was subsequently split and he was ordered to serve confinement for six months and placed on probation 
for five years.  On the sale charge, he was sentenced, in part, to confinement for five years.  Applicant was eventually identified as a "5 years special condition 
defendant," and the sentence was altered to confinement for a period of six months, the remainder of imprisonment was suspended, he was placed on probation 
for five years, and fined $5,000.00.  While the entire sentencing scheme is somewhat confusing, at some point in the process Applicant was sentenced to 
confinement for five years.  Thus, as noted above, the implementing guidance attached to the memorandum indicates such a sentence would disqualify persons 
with "sentences imposed of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>more than </EM>one year, regardless of the amount of time actually served.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  In this instance, Applicant was fortunate enough to have his 
prison terms reduced and partially suspended rather than actually served, but that does not help him in this issue.  Consequently, by virtue of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">10 U.S.C. &sect; 986</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, I 
conclude Applicant is not eligible for a security clearance.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.d. of the SOR, are concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case under Guideline E.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's conduct since 1967 has clearly involved questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  In addition to the criminal conduct described above, Applicant 
has an extensive history of other misconduct or questionable personal conduct.  In 1992, he declined to take a polygraph examination which had been requested 
of him as part of his security clearance investigation.  In 1997 he underwent a disciplinary suspension by his employer for a pattern of attendance infractions, 
and was subsequently terminated, effective January 1998.  Another infraction with a new employer resulted with his employment being terminated in 1999.  
Employment with another employer was terminated that same year when he stole a raincoat.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">And in 1999, he deliberately provided false or misleading 
information and concealed material facts from his SF 86.  Throughout the entire period, save for brief periods of acceptable conduct</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, Applicant exhibited a 
pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, and immature behavior.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's overall conduct clearly falls within Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.5. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, 
including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency</EM>), and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">E2.A5.1.2.1 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>reliable, unfavorable information 
provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances</EM>).  Furthermore, because of his 1992 refusal to undergo a polygraph which 
was sought in connection with his security clearance investigation process, the concern set forth in E2.A5.1.1.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>refusal to undergo or cooperate with required 
security processing, including medical and psychological testing</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's actions in falsifying material facts, as well as deliberately omitting or concealing relevant or material facts from his SF 86 in 1999, activate PC DC 
E2.A5.1.2.2. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>).  The four allegations pertaining to falsification have been admitted, but in no instance, has 
Applicant offered any explanation or justification as to motivation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">It is of substantial concern that Applicant previously had the opportunity to be a law-abiding citizen and remain abstinent after he had been granted a security 
clearance.  He had already been punished twice for his substance abuse activities.  Unfortunately, Applicant was not up to the task and failed to seize that 
opportunity</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.  Instead, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">while on company business as a government contractor in another country, and while holding a security clearance, Applicant resumed his 
substance abuse by purchasing and smoking hashish</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.  His actions disregarded his fiduciary relationship with the government.  In so doing, he took that special 
relationship and effectively dashed the trust and confidence that the government had placed in him.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">While a person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, without a clear indication of subsequent reform, remorse, or rehabilitation, 
I am unable to determine with reasonable certainty the probability that such conduct will not recur in the future.  Without more, I simply do not believe that the 
period of time from the most recent acknowledged conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations--that which occurred in 1999--to the closing of the record, is sufficient to persuade me that recurrence of 
such conduct is unlikely.  Consequently, I conclude that Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government`s case.  Accordingly, allegations 2.a. 
through 2.i. of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
