<P>On 30 <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">August 2000, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating 
that DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="00-0432.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
a security clearance for Applicant. On 27 September 2000, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was 
assigned to me on 18 October 2000. However, at the time the case was assigned to me it was subject to a moratorium on issuing final 
decisions in certain types of Guideline J cases, pending resolution of proposed legislation which would affect the processing of these 
cases. Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 amended Title 10 U.S. Code to 
add a new section, &sect; 986, precluding the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense (DoD) under 
four specific circumstances. On 7 June 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued implementing regulations under DoD 5200.2-R; 
the Director, DOHA issued Operating Instruction 64 (O.I. 64) on 10 July 2001, lifting the moratorium effective 23 July 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 25 July 2001, I issued an amended SOR in accordance with O.I. 64. Because of postal delays, Applicant did not receive the 
amended SOR until 21 August 2001. On 10 September 2001, Applicant--through counsel--timely requested an extension of time to 
file the answer; Department Counsel did not object, and I granted the extension to 20 September 2001. Applicant answered the 
amended SOR on 18 September. I set the case for hearing on 22 October 2001, and issued a notice of hearing on 23 October 2000 
for a hearing on 15 November 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   At the hearing, the Government presented four exhibits--admitted pursuant to stipulation--and no witnesses; Applicant presented 
four exhibits--admitted without objection--and the testimony of one witness, himself. DOHA received the transcript on 26 November 
2001.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 10 September 2001, Applicant requested an extension of time to file his answer, and Department Counsel interposed no objection 
to the request. Consequently, I granted the extension of time to file.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing (Tr. 11-014), I admitted Government's Exhibits 1-4 pursuant to stipulation between Applicant and the Government, after 
ascertaining that Applicant understood the import of the agreement.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the factual allegations of the SOR; accordingly, Applicant's admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 44-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 13 November 1990, Applicant executed a Personnel Security Questionnaire (G.E. 1) on which he answered "yes" to a question 
designed to elicit his arrest record, and disclosed an approximately January 1979 misdemeanor marijuana possession charge for which 
he served six months probation and forty hours of community service. He also answered "yes" to a question designed to elicit his use 
and possession of illegal drugs, and disclosed his occasional use and possession of marijuana before his 1979 arrest. However, he did 
not disclose that he had also used  used cocaine on two occasions in approximately 1978.<A HREF="00-0432.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant was granted a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between approximately March 1990 and summer 1990--during a period of unemployment and underemployment--Applicant served 
as middleman<A HREF="00-0432.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> for three separate marijuana sales totaling about 135 pounds.  For his role in the transactions, Applicant was paid 
approximately $50.00 per pound, or a little over $6,400.00. (G.E. 4).<A HREF="00-0432.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Although Applicant was aware of the criminal nature of his 
conduct, he considered that his risk on a first offense was slim (Tr. 41). Nevertheless, he was concerned about his criminal liability, and 
ceased participating in the criminal conspiracy in approximately June or July 1990. Several years passed, and Applicant came to believe 
he had escaped criminal responsibility for his conduct. He had not.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 21 October 1993, Applicant was charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of marijuana--a 
violation of 21 U.S.C. &sect;846, a felony. Applicant initially faced a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, a $1,000,000.00 fine, 
and three years of supervised probation. However, Applicant began to cooperate with Federal authorities early in the process and 
negotiated a plea arrangement which offered Applicant a three-level downward sentence adjustment under the Federal sentencing 
guidelines in recognition of Applicant's acceptance of responsibility for his conduct, conditioned upon Applicant's full cooperation with 
the Government's prosecution of other related drug cases. Applicant met his end of the bargain, and the Government filed its required 
otion to Recognize Defendant's Substantial Assistance, and the presiding judge granted the motion; thus, instead of facing sentencing 
under level 19 of the sentencing guidelines,<A HREF="00-0432.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Applicant faced sentencing under level 16 of the sentencing guidelines<A HREF="00-0432.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> and was ultimately 
sentenced to 24 months imprisonment, a $10,000.00 fine, and three years supervised probation. Execution of the fine was stayed to 
permit Applicant to make payment once he was released from prison and able to work.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant successfully completed his prison term, and his supervised probation (during which he passed random drug tests)(Tr. 32).  
There has been no recurrence of the criminal conduct since 1990.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been married eighteen years, and has two sons. Applicant has been involved in his sons' lives as a baseball and football 
coach in organized leagues, and as an assistant scoutmaster. He has not gone out of his way to disclose his criminal past to these 
organizations, but assumes that the fact is generally known because of the small size of the community in which Applicant and his family 
live. Applicant was asked to apply for the job he currently has by his former supervisor from 1993, who is aware of Applicant's criminal 
past.<A HREF="00-0432.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's character references (A.E. A., B., C.) consider him a good employee, and a reliable friend and family man. None of the 
references recite an awareness of Applicant's criminal record, although one reference (A.E. B) appears to be Applicant's father-in-law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and 
circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the 
Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc.,</EM> under an assessment of the whole person.</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the 
burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or 
mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an applicant's fitness for access to classified information 
requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the 
likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and 
confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the 
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States 
Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline E. The information sought by the Government on the security clearance 
application in 1990 was relevant and material to the Government's investigation of the Applicant's fitness for access to classified 
information, and the Applicant knowingly and wilfully falsified that information. However, I conclude this conduct is mitigated. At the 
time Applicant completed the 1990 clearance application, he disclosed his most recent and most extensive drug use, as well as his 1979 
misdemeanor possession arrest. His experimental use of cocaine on two occasions in approximately 1978, while involving an admittedly 
more serious drug, nevertheless would not have added appreciably greater weight to the derogatory information disclosed by Applicant, 
and would not have affected the decision to grant Applicant's clearance at that time. Consequently, I conclude that the omitted 
information was not pertinent to a clearance determination. Second, while Applicant did not make a prompt, good faith effort to correct 
the falsification before being confronted with the facts within the meaning of Mitigating Condition E2.A.5.1.3.3. (mostly because the 
disclosure was not prompt), the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent (having occurred over 11 years ago), and 
Applicant later provided correct information voluntarily. Indeed, Applicant provided this information before being confronted with it, 
disclosed this information without any reason to believe that the Government was aware of it, and indeed, disclosed it precisely because 
he wanted to make a clean break with all of his past conduct (Tr. 37). Under these circumstances, I conclude it unlikely Applicant will 
engage in similar behavior in the future.  I find criterion E. for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline J. Applicant's criminal conduct in the Spring and Summer 1990 was serious, a 
conclusion confirmed by the fact that Applicant was sentenced to two years in prison and a $10,000.00 fine even with the full benefit of 
his plea arrangement and cooperation with Federal prosecutors. Nevertheless, I conclude that the criminal conduct is otherwise 
mitigated, but for the application of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 to this case. First, Applicant abandoned his participation in the criminal endeavor 
in Summer 1990, long before he was charged with the offense. Although Applicant indeed had every reason to fully comply with the 
terms of his plea arrangement, thus lessening the weight that can be accorded this conduct, the fact remains that Applicant is entitled to 
some credit for his cooperation with Federal prosecutors beyond that already reflected in his lowered sentence. Furthermore, the 
criminal conduct was not recent, having occurred over 11 years ago, and was isolated, being confined to a fairly discrete period of time 
in Spring and Summer 1990.<A HREF="00-0432.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Finally, there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation, documented both by Applicant's continued 
participation in community activities and his character references which, while not indicating any knowledge of Applicant's criminal past, 
nevertheless attest to his work performance and family involvement.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Were this the end of the analysis under Guideline J., I would conclude Applicant's criminal conduct in 1990 mitigated. However, as 
alleged in subparagraph c. of the SOR, Applicant's case falls within the purview of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. Under the new regulations issued 
by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, because Applicant was convicted in Federal court and sentenced to imprisonment for more than 
one year, I may not mitigate his criminal conduct. Accordingly, I find Guideline J. against Applicant. However, because I do so solely 
because of the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 to this case, I make the following statement as required by O.I. 64 in such a case: I 
recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 .</SPAN></P>
