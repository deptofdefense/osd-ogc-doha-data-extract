<P>Applicant has over $57,000 in delinquent debt. Of that amount, $30,000 consists of student loans. Several years after graduating from college, she became the provider for her mother and younger sister 
after their father left the family. After several efforts towards resolving her accounts,  she decided to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Her student loans have been consolidated. Her mother and sister are

<P>On August 23, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an ADP I/II/III position. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application 
under Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program, </EM>(Jan, 1987), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program </EM>(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").<A HREF="05-05379.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On November 23, 2005, DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, 
which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under </SPAN>Guideline F, Financial Considerations.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement dated </SPAN>December 26, 2005<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN>The case was assigned to me on May 24, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A notice of hearing was issued on

without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - D which were admitted into the record without objection. </SPAN>The record was held open until August 1, 
2006, to allow Applicant to submit further documents. AE E was timely submitted and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 27, 2006.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 23, 2004, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85-P).<A HREF="05-05379.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Her background investigation revealed 12 delinquent accounts with a total approximate balance of

<P> In September 2001, Applicant's father left the family and his car dealership went bankrupt.   Her mother was unemployed and in poor health. Applicant became responsible for providing for her mother 
and younger sister.  She relied on credit cards for paying living expenses and was unable to make payments on her credit cards and student loan accounts which soon became delinquent.<A HREF="05-05379.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Her parents

counseling.<A HREF="05-05379.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  The financial counseling taught her the difference between good debt and bad debt.<A HREF="05-05379.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> She follows a budget. After expenses, she has approximately $40 to $60 left over each month.<A HREF="05-05379.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">DoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in DoD Directive 5220.6 before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.<A HREF="05-05379.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> Initially, the Government must

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those 
individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  (Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.)  It 
is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>), and FC DC 3 (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) </EM>apply 
to Applicant's case.  Applicant has had difficulty meeting her financial obligations since 2001.  She incurred 12 delinquent debts with an approximate total balance of $57,000, including $30,000 in 
delinquent student loans.</P> 
 
<P>I considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) and conclude FC MC 3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation)</EM>) applies.  Applicant became the sole provider for her mother and sister when her father left the 
family in September 2001. She relied on credit cards to pay their living expenses.  Her mother was unemployed and in poor health at the time. Their daily living expenses overwhelmed her and soon her 
debts became delinquent.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC 4 (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control</EM>) applies.  In addition to filing for 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, Applicant attended financial counseling on two occasions.  She has learned from this experience. She consolidated all of her student loans. She has no open credit card 
accounts. She established a budget and is able to pay all of her expenses. She has been proactive in resolving her financial situation.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC 6 (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) is also applicable. Applicant tried to resolve her delinquent accounts by paying her creditors.  
The debt was overwhelming so she chose to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, a legally permissable means to resolve debt.  A security concern can potentially remain even after an applicant files 
for bankruptcy.  The reason for the bankruptcy must be considered.  In Applicant's case, her financial problems resulted from factors that were beyond her control. After her father left, she did the 
honorable thing and provided for her mother and younger sister.  They are now able to care for themselves. Applicant has taken every action within her means to resolve her debts. No security concern 
remains due to her filing for bankruptcy.      </P> 
 
<P>Although her bankruptcy discharge was recent, Applicant has taken steps to insure that she is able to properly manage her finances in the future. She appears to be a mature and responsible young 
woman. She has mitigated the security concern under Guideline F.  Guideline F is decided for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the trustworthiness determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a 
person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in 
considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own 
merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the evidence and the "whole person" in evaluating Applicant's trustworthiness. Applicant has an exemplary work history. She is loyal to her friends and family. She has taken 
positive steps to deal with her financial problems. Based on the evidence in the record, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. 
Eligibility is granted.</P>
