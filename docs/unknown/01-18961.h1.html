<P>The Applicant is a dual national, who fully intends to retain her dual citizenship, and has offered no evidence that she has "surrendered" her foreign passport, as 
required by the <EM>Money Memo</EM>.  She has also offered no evidence that her foreign relatives are not agents of or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power.  
Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 10, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on May 9, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on June 21, 2002.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received her copy on July 1, 2002, and Applicant's reply was received on or about July 15, 2002.  The case was received by the 
undersigned for resolution on September 20, 2002.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's foreign preference and perceived foreign influence 
militate against the granting of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of Relevant Material and Applicant's Response.  The Applicant is 33 years 
of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline C - Foreign Preference</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.~1.f.  The Applicant was born in Country A, immigrated to the United States about 1994, and became a U.S. citizen in 1998 (Item 4 at page 1, and Item 5 at 
page 1).  The Applicant is thus a dual citizen of Country A and of the United States (<EM>id</EM>).  She has maintained her Country A passport since becoming a U.S. 
citizen, and has also renewed it since becoming a U.S. citizen (Item 5 at page 2).  In April of 1999, she traveled to Country A, using her Country A passport.  In 
a sworn statement executed on February 15, 2000, the Applicant averred, "I declared dual citizenship because I am proud of my . . . [Country A] heritage and 
want to maintain strong ties to . . . [Country A]" (Item 5 at page 1).  She further avers, "I would not be willing to renounce my . . . [Country A] citizenship or 
relinquish my . . . [Country A] passport if it were to become a condition of access" (Item 5 at page 2).  She also states, "I owe my national allegiance to both to 
the US and . . . [Country A]" (<EM>id</EM>).  Finally, in her one page Response to the Government's FORM, the Applicant admits "I will inherit a parcel of land in . . . 
[Country A] upon disposition of my deceased father's estate.  However, even though I do not know the exact value of the property, I do know it is not of 
substantial value."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a.~2.i.  The Applicant's husband, sister and father-in-law are dual citizens of Country A and of the United States (Item 4 at pages 5 and 6, and Item 5 at page 
1).  The Applicant's other siblings, two sisters and a brother, two nephews, a niece and an aunt are all foreign nationals and reside outside of the United States 
(Item 4 at pages 5 and 6, and Item 5 at page 4).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her Response, the Applicant avers the following:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I recently learned that, as a . . . [Country A] citizen, I do not need a visa anymore to enter . . . [Country A] when visiting, if I do not possess a . . . [Country A] 
passport.  As such, I do not foresee a need to maintain a . . . [Country A] passport, as I could use my US passport to travel to . . . [Country A] without having to 
obtain a visa.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Preference</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  The exercise of dual citizenship;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">none</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  An immediate family member . . . is a citizen of . . . a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">none</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference) and Guideline B (foreign influence), which establishes doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and her ability to 
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct or situation, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates a foreign preference, or who is subject to a foreign influence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are 
harmful to the interests of the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all 
security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is a dual citizen of Country A and of the United States.  She has expressed allegiance to Country A, in conjunction with her allegiance to the U.S.  
She has also traveled to Country A, using his Country A passport, in 1999.  Despite being appraised of the <EM>Money Memo</EM> ("Guide to DoD Central Adjudication 
Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of the Foreign Preference Adjudication Guidelines," dated September 1, 2000) (FORM at page 3), the Applicant  
only intimates that she does not see the need to "maintain" her Country A passport, but she apparently still maintains it.  In light of the <EM>Money Memo</EM>, Guideline 
C must be found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to her foreign relatives who reside outside of the United States, the Applicant has failed to offer any evidence that they "are not agents of a foreign power or 
[not] in a position to be exploited by a foreign power," as required by the first mitigating condition under Foreign Influence.  Therefore, Guideline B is also 
found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding her foreign preference.  The Applicant has thus not met the 
mitigating conditions of Guidelines B and C, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, she has not met her ultimate burden of persuasion under 
Guidelines B and C.</SPAN></P>
