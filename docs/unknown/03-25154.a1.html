<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On January 6, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 31, 2006, after the hearing, 
Administrative Judge Michael J. Breslin denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 
and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process of law; whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding the 
security concerns raised under Guidelines E had not been mitigated.<A HREF="03-25154.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(1) Applicant argues he was denied due process of law because Department Counsel did not call the Defense Security Service investigator as a witness at the 
hearing.  The Board does not find Applicant's argument persuasive. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A review of the record indicates Applicant was provided with the procedural rights set forth in Executive Order 10865 and the Directive.  There is no indication 
from the record that Applicant requested the Defense Security Service (DSS) agent be present at the hearing or objected to proceeding without him.  Although 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>pro se</EM> applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., 
</EM>ISCR Case No. 00-0593 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001).  If they fail to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights, that failure to act does not constitute a 
denial of their rights.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-19896 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2003).  Because Applicant did not object to proceeding or otherwise request a 
continuance of his case, he cannot fairly claim he was denied due process under the Directive or Executive Order.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(2) Applicant also argues that the Administrative Judge erred by concluding the security concerns raised under Guidelines E had not been mitigated because 
Applicant was entitled, as a matter of law, to a favorable application of the mitigating conditions and the "whole person" concept.  Again, the Board does not 
find Applicant's arguments persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  
Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. 
Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Administrative Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  
As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice 
versa</EM>.  An applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not 
sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Judge's decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the nature and seriousness of the disqualifying 
conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge found in favor of the Applicant with respect to some of the 
factual allegations.  However, the Judge articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying any mitigating conditions to the remainder of the allegations, and 
reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  
Given the record that was before him, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline E is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
