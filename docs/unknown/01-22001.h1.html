<P>Applicant is a 69-year-old employee of a defense contractor who works as a security guard.  He did not file tax returns for six years between 1989 and 1994 
while working overseas for a private company. After Applicant returned to the U.S. he failed to file tax returns for five more years between 1996 and 2000. 
Applicant filed for bankruptcy in February 1995, but it was dismissed by the court in December 1995, for failure to make a required payment. Two tax liens 
were filed against Applicant by the IRS in 1996. At one time the IRS claimed he owed $163,000.00. Applicant falsified answers to questions on his SF 86 dated 
February 2000 by failing to acknowledge the tax liens and his delinquent debts. Clearance is denied. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On September 3, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry, </EM>as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement dated October 15, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on the 
written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on March 22, 2004. A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM) was provided to the Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation. Applicant responded with additional information on May 12, 2004 and the case was assigned to me on May 20, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the information in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 69-year-old employee of a defense contractor who works as a security guard. He incurred approximately $163,000.00 in delinquent debts to the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS). At the time the SOR was prepared these debts had been reduced to $4,000.00 and a payment plan had been placed in effect. 
Applicant did not file tax returns for six years between 1989 and 1994 while he was working overseas for a private company.</P> 
<P>After Applicant returned to the U.S. he failed to file tax returns for five more years between 1996 and 2000. Applicant filed for bankruptcy in February1995, but 
it was dismissed by the court in December 1995, for failure to make a required payment. Two tax liens were filed against Applicant by the IRS in 1996. </P> 
<P>Applicant paid two small debts in 2001 that were unrelated to the IRS problems(SOR &para; 1.g and 1.h).</P> 
<P>Applicant falsified answers to questions on his security clearance application (SF 86) dated February 2000, by deliberately failing to acknowledge the tax liens 
(Question 36) and his delinquent debts (Questions 38 and 39).</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b)<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's delinquent debts prompted the allegation in the SOR of violation of Guideline F in that an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of 
having to engage in illegal acts</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">to generate funds. (E2.A6.1.1.) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include a history of not meeting financial obligations 
(E2.A6.1.2.1.) and evidence of</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. (E2.A6.1.2.3.) Mitigating Conditions (MC) include the</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fact that the person has initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. (E2.A6.1.3.6.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was exempt from payment of federal taxes while he was working overseas because the amount he was paid was below the threshold amount that 
required payment of tax. However, he was not exempt from filing tax returns. Upon his return to the U.S. he was obliged to pay taxes but neither paid nor filed 
returns for five more years. He avers that he was confused by the status of claims by the IRS so did not file. His filing for bankruptcy was based on the 
erroneous belief that this would resolve his tax problems. He blames this on bad advice. Applicant has since received advice from a private tax counselor with 
assistance from the Taxpayer Advocate office of the IRS and has resolved his difficulties with IRS (Encl. 1 to Answer).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While his failure to file when working overseas might be understandable, it is not adequately explained and mitigated as to why he failed to file for five years 
after his return to the U.S. Although he was involved in a protracted dispute with IRS that he appears to have eventually won on the financial aspects of the 
dispute, this did not relieve him of the obligation to file returns for the years in question. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The remaining IRS debt is not sufficiently large that it cannot be resolved with Applicant's current income and he is doing so under the IRS plan. However, 
even though the IRS debts have largely been resolved, I conclude that mitigating factors are not applicable because of the failure to file tax returns for so many 
years.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations under Guideline E concerning lack of candor (E2.A5.1.1.) is based on the fact that he failed to acknowledge his tax lien and delinquent debts on 
his SF 86. Even though he felt the liens were in error, he did know of them and should have reported them as well as the debts that the IRS believed were 
delinquent at the time of the filing of the SF 86. No mitigating factors are applicable. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant's admissions, the Government has established reasons to deny him a security clearance because of 
criminal conduct. Having established such reasons, the Applicant has the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or 
extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424 
(App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As the policy prescribes, the burden shifted to the Applicant to show that the mitigating conditions are applicable to him. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant clearance to Applicant.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
