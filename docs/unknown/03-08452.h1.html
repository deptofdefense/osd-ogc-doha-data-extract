<P>Applicant is 68 years old, a retired businessman, who now drives his trucks for a defense contractor hauling classified and secure loads.  Applicant failed to 
disclose a $256,000 judgment on his security clearance application, nor did he disclose his 1998 lawsuit with his wife against another businessman.  Applicant 
has not paid the judgment, and refuses to do so.  He is making payments on an Internal Revenue Service debt.  Applicant has not successfully mitigated the 
financial considerations and personal conduct security clearance concerns.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On September 21, 2004, DOHA issued 
a Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-08452.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on November 20, 2004, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative 
judge.  The case was assigned to me on January 3, 2005.  On May 19, 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  The 
Government moved to amend the SOR to add an allegation Paragraph 1.b. concerning a Federal tax lien filed February 15, 2005, against Applicant.  Applicant 
had no objection to the amendment and the motion was granted.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 27, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, 
and full consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is 68 years old, a retired rental property manager and condominium yacht club consultant, who now owns two tractor trailer trucks he and his wife 
lease to a defense contractor in which classified and critical loads are shipped.  Applicant and his wife gross $180,000 annually for ten months of driving.  His 
wife is a retired bank assistant vice president.  Applicant owned his rental property management company from about 1978 to 1997.  He operated at one time 
5,000 apartments for their owners, employed up to 107 staff, and collected at one time $1 million monthly in rent. (Tr. 18, 20, 25, 26, 30, 41, 49-52, 56; 
Exhibits 1 and 2)</P> 
<P>Applicant's agreement with a condominium yacht club development owner and a bank occurred sometime in 1991 to 1992.  With the savings and loan crises 
then in the U.S., the bank was no longer able to make loans, and closed, causing the development to fail.  Applicant and his partner were sued personally by the 
owner on an agreement they all signed, and a jury trial held in September 1996.  Applicant and his partner, who later declared bankruptcy, were ordered to pay 
$256,679 plus about $75,000 in attorney's fees.  Applicant attended the trial and was represented by legal counsel.  That judgment was the subject of a foreign 
judgment filing in Applicant's home state and county on June 20, 1997.  Applicant has not paid this judgment, and does not intend to ever pay it.  He regards 
himself as cheated and a victim of the savings and loan debacle.  Applicant did not list this judgment in answer to Question 27.d. of his August 20, 2002, 
security clearance application (SCA) (<EM>In the past 7 years, have you had any judgments against you that have not been paid?</EM>), but answered this question with a 
"no".  Applicant thought the judgment was in 1991 or 1992.  Applicant also did not list the unpaid judgment debt in answer to SCA Questions 28.a. (<EM>In the last 
7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?</EM>) and Question 28.b. (<EM>Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?</EM>).  No where 
on his SCA did Applicant disclose any information about the 1996 judgment. (Tr. 24-28, 40-46, 61, 65; Exhibits 2-4, D)</P> 
<P>Applicant had a lien filed against him by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on February 15, 2005,  in the amount of $40,061, relating to payroll taxes owed 
from 1992 to 1994.  The trust fund part of the tax debt was paid on time, but Applicant is obligated for penalty and interest because his name  was on the IRS 
documents as the responsible party.  Applicant has an agreement with the IRS to pay $150 monthly by deduction from his social security payments.  Applicant 
has been paying on that agreement for about four years.  Applicant did not list this IRS debt on his SCA in answer to Questions 27.b. (<EM>In the last 7 years, have 
you had your wages garnished or has any property repossessed for any reason?</EM>). (Tr. 30-32, 35, 49-54; Exhibits 1 and 5)</P> 
<P>Applicant and his wife filed a lawsuit against a person who Applicant's wife claimed violated certain of her rights, with Applicant filing as a plaintiff for loss of 
consortium.  The lawsuit was filed in October 1998, and settled in May 2000.  Applicant did not disclose this lawsuit on his SCA in answer to Question 29 (<EM>In 
the last 7 years, have you been a party to any public record civil court actions not listed elsewhere on this form?</EM>).  Applicant claims he forgot about it because 
his wife was the lead plaintiff.  However, Applicant's statement to the government investigator on December 6, 2002, states he filed the lawsuit and dismissed 
it because he was paid in a settlement.  Applicant and his wife worked on completing their respective SCA forms in 2002 at the same time and over a two day 
period.  Her lawsuit was listed on her SCA. (Tr. 33-38, 60; Exhibits 1 and 2)</P> 
<P>Applicant submitted three character reference letters.  His references have known him many years and regard him as honest. (Exhibits A-C)</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, <EM>Safeguarding 
Classified Information with Industry</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">&sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960)<EM>. </EM> Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well 
as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully considered in making the overall common 
sense determination required.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Those assessments include:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of 
knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the 
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). 
Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or 
that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable 
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or 
other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven 
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. 
ay 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an 
applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No. 
00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case by substantial evidence, the burden 
shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive &para; E2.2.2.  
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F:Financial Considerations: <EM>The Concern</EM>: <EM>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. </EM>E2.A6.1.1</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E: Personal Conduct: <EM>The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </EM>E2.A5.1.1</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations in the SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The essence of the SOR allegations is that 
Applicant has a large judgment against him personally from a failed business transaction in the early 1990's, and was a party plaintiff in a lawsuit he and his 
wife filed against another businessman in 1998, yet he did not disclose either lawsuit, and judgment debt, on his SCA.  Also, he has a substantial IRS tax debt 
that has not been paid, but is being paid by an installment payment method.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding Guideline F, Financial Considerations, Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations E2.A6.1.2.1) and DC 3 
(Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts E2.A6.1.2.3) apply.  Applicant refuses to pay the 1996 judgment.  He is paying $150 monthly through a social 
security deduction.  His current income is high enough that he could make periodic payments on the judgment to pay it off, or could have tried to settle for a 
lesser amount.  Instead, he ignored it.  The debt exists for the purpose of evaluating security clearance eligibility even though Applicant's state law would not 
allow plaintiff to execute on the judgment after five years of non-execution (Exhibit D).  The issue here is Applicant's failure to pay a debt, not the effect of the 
state law, that cannot override the Directive for security clearance purposes.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Mitigating Condition applicable to the IRS debt is MC 6 (Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts 
E2.A6.1.3.6).  Applicant is paying that debt.  While I conclude that specific allegation for Applicant, allegation Paragraph 1.a. and Guideline F I conclude 
against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The deliberate falsification allegations under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, I consider the DC applicable are DC 2 (The deliberate omission, concealment, or 
falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, or similar form used to determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness E2.A5.1.2.2) applies.  Applicant deliberately failed to disclose significant financial obligations and legal actions involving him on his SCA.  I 
do not find his explanations credible, in large part because he is a successful businessman whose former business collected $12 million annually in rents for 
apartment owners, paid a 107 person staff monthly, and was a consultant who traveled out of his home state to work on condominium yacht club projects.  His 
current trucking operation grosses $180,000 annually for ten months driving.  He is not an unsophisticated person, but an experienced businessman.  When 
completing his SCA over two days of work it is not reasonable for me to believe, in simultaneous discussions with his wife about her SCA, that Applicant could 
not research or remember the time he spent in court in 1996 regarding a $256,000 lawsuit.  This same debt was over 180 days delinquent, and he failed to 
disclose it in Question 28.  Applicant failed a third time to disclose this lawsuit or his lawsuit against a former business associate in which his wife was a party, 
even though they included it in his wife's SCA.  Applicant further failed disclosure a fourth time when he failed to use the "continuation space" on page 9 of 
the SCA to explain these lawsuits.  According to Applicant, he forgot anything adverse that happened to him financially between August 1995 and August 
2002, the time period for disclosure sought by the SCA.  That lack of recollection is not believable.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude no MC apply here because my analysis of the facts show that none could apply.  Applicant deliberately falsified his SCA for the reasons stated.  
Therefore, I conclude this Guideline against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:</SPAN></P>
