  The applicability of an Adjudicative Guidelines mitigating condition is not solely dispositive of a case.  The Administrative Judge's failure to give any explanation for an apparent favorable formal finding leaves the Board unable to discern whether the Judge analyzed an aspect of the case in a rational  manner or in an arbitrary and capricious manner.  Applicant's situational, ad hoc use of the rights and privileges of Egyptian citizenship to evade or circumvent  legitimate United States customs and border inquiry into his trip to Egypt raises serious security concerns under Guideline C.  It was arbitrary and capricious for  the Judge to fail to discuss Applicant's conduct in concealing from U.S. officials his trip to Egypt.  Favorable decision reversed.</P>

<P>Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny issued a decision, dated October 10, 2002, in which he concluded it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Department Counsel appealed.</P> 
 
<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's possession and use of an 
Egyptian passport was mitigated under Guideline C; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's family ties with relatives in 
Egypt were mitigated under Guideline B.  For the reasons that follow, the Board reverses the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated December 26, 2001.  The SOR was based on Guideline 
C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  A hearing was held on June 6, 2002.  The Administrative Judge issued a written decision, dated 
October 10, 2002, in which he concluded it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case is 
before the Board on Department Counsel's appeal from the Judge's favorable decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 
2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 
87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P>

<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's possession and use of an Egyptian passport was mitigated under Guideline C</SPAN>.  The 
Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant's possession and use of an Egyptian passport has been mitigated by his actions to formally renounce his 
Egyptian citizenship and surrender of his Egyptian passport.  Department Counsel contends the Judge erred because: (a) the Judge misapplied Foreign 
Preference Mitigating Condition 4; (b) the Judge erred by accepting a form of legal necessity defense as mitigating of Applicant's renewal of his Egyptian 
passport; (c) the Judge's decision contains no explanation for his conclusion that Applicant had mitigated the conduct covered by SOR subparagraph 1.d; (d) 
the Judge failed to give due weight to the security significance of the facts and circumstances of Applicant's use of his Egyptian passport in his most recent trip; 
and (e) the Judge's finding of mitigation fails to take into account the totality of Applicant's actions.  Applicant counters Department Counsel's arguments by 
asserting: (i) the record evidence supports the Judge's application of Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 1; (ii) the Judge's favorable conclusions under 
Guideline C reflect an overall commonsense decision based on consideration of all the record evidence; (iii) Applicant's conduct under SOR subparagraph 1.d 
does not demonstrate a foreign preference; and (iv) it was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to enter formal findings in favor of 
Applicant with respect to SOR subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d.</P> 
 
<P>(a) Department Counsel contends the Administrative Judge erred by giving undue or controlling weight to his application of Foreign Preference Mitigating 
Condition 4.<A HREF="01-16419.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Given the record evidence in this case, the Administrative Judge had a sufficient basis to apply Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 4.  
However, the applicability of Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 4 is not solely dispositive under Guideline C.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-20906 
(January 10, 2003) at pp. 6-7 (discussing need for Judge to exercise sound judgment in applying pertinent provisions of Adjudicative Guidelines).  Given the 
record evidence in this case, it would be arbitrary and capricious for the Judge to enter formal findings under Guideline C solely based on application of Foreign 
Preference Mitigating Condition 4.  Under the whole person concept, Applicant's recent actions to renounce his Egyptian citizenship had to be weighed in light 
of the record evidence as a whole, including record evidence that Applicant used his Egyptian passport to evade or circumvent legitimate United States customs 
and border inquiry about his trip to Egypt after September 11, 2001.  A reading of the decision below indicates the Judge applied Foreign Preference Mitigating 
Condition 4 in a mechanical manner that failed to take into account record evidence that undercut the weight that reasonably could be given to that mitigating 
condition.</P> 
 
<P>(b) Department Counsel correctly notes that the Board has held that legal necessity is no longer extenuating or mitigating of an applicant's possession and use 
of a foreign passport after the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASDC3I) promulgated the August 16, 
2000 memorandum on foreign passports.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 99-0532 (February 27, 2001) at p. 6.  However, nothing in the decision below indicates the 
Administrative Judge found Applicant's possession and use of an Egyptian passport was extenuated or mitigated because of legal necessity.  Accordingly, this 
claim of error is not persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>(c) Department Counsel contends the Administrative Judge's decision contains no explanation for his conclusion that Applicant had mitigated the conduct 
covered by SOR subparagraph 1.d.  Although the Judge made a factual finding concerning SOR subparagraph 1.d and applied Foreign Preference Disqualifying 
Condition 1 to Applicant's conduct (Decision at p. 6), the Judge did not state whether he found Applicant's conduct under SOR subparagraph 1.d was 
extenuated or mitigated and the Judge did not enter a formal finding, favorable or unfavorable, with respect to SOR subparagraph 1.d.  The Judge's failure to do 
so constitutes a violation of his obligation to make findings and reach conclusions about the SOR allegations.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, 
Item E3.1.25.  Because the Judge made a favorable security clearance decision, it can be inferred that the Judge concluded that Applicant's conduct under SOR 
subparagraph 1.d was extenuated or mitigated.  However, Department Counsel correctly notes the Judge's decision contains no discussion or explanation of 
how or why the Judge reached such a favorable conclusion with respect to SOR subparagraph 1.d.  Without such a discussion or explanation in the decision, the 
Board is unable to discern whether the Judge analyzed that aspect of the case in a rational manner or in an arbitrary and capricious manner.</P> 
 
<P>(d) The Administrative Judge found the following: (i) between mid-December 2001 and mid-January 2002, Applicant visited Egypt; (ii) Applicant's father 
advised him not to use his U.S. passport when traveling in Egypt because of the father's fear that it would be dangerous to do so; (iii) Applicant followed his 
father's advice and used his Egyptian passport to enter and exit Egypt; and (iv) Applicant felt that he might be unfairly detained upon reentering the United 
States if he had an Egyptian stamp on his U.S. passport (Decision at p. 3).  Department Counsel contends the Judge's favorable conclusions under Guideline C 
are arbitrary and capricious because Applicant's conduct on that trip</P> 
 
<P>"demonstrates a specific attempt to <EM>avoid</EM> being identified as a United States citizen, to hide his United States citizenship, and to be identified as a citizen of 
another country.  Furthermore, Applicant used his foreign passport to enter and leave Egypt after September 11, 2001 in order to avoid U.S. officials seeing an 
Egyptian stamp in his U.S. passport."  (italics in original)</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel's claim of error is persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>Given the SOR allegations in this case, the facts and circumstances of Applicant's possession and use of an Egyptian passport are relevant to an evaluation of 
his security eligibility.  Under the whole person concept, an Administrative Judge must consider all available information, both favorable and unfavorable, 
concerning an applicant's conduct and circumstances.  Furthermore, a Judge must consider the nature and seriousness of an applicant's conduct, the recency and 
frequency of the applicant's conduct, and the applicant's motivation(s).  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Section 6.3; Enclosure 2, Item E2.2.1.  Prior to September 11, 2001, any 
effort to deliberately prevent U.S. customs or border officials from seeing information that is potentially relevant to the execution of their duties would reflect 
serious misconduct that raises troubling questions about an applicant's intentions and motivations.  Engaging in such misconduct after September 11, 2001 is 
aggravating because Applicant knew that there were well-founded increased security concerns at the borders of the United States.  Applicant's situational, ad 
hoc use of the rights and privileges of Egyptian citizenship to evade or circumvent legitimate United States customs and border inquiry into his trip to Egypt 
raises serious security concerns under Guideline C.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (February 8, 2001) (reversing favorable security clearance decision 
where applicant used a foreign passport and exercised the rights and privileges of foreign citizenship to remove his children from the jurisdiction of a state court 
in United States to evade or thwart legal process in a child custody battle).  Given the evidence that Applicant used his Egyptian and U.S. passports to conceal 
from U.S. officials his trip to Egypt, it was arbitrary and capricious for the Judge to fail to discuss that aspect of this case or explain why he did not consider 
Applicant's conduct security-significant.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0228 (March 12, 2001) at p. 5 ("An Administrative Judge's decision can be arbitrary and 
capricious if: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between 
the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the 
case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of 
opinion.").</P> 
 
<P>(e) Department Counsel also contends the Administrative Judge's favorable conclusions fail to take into account the totality of Applicant's actions.  The Board 
agrees.  Our reading of the decision below persuades us that the Judge engaged in a piecemeal analysis of Applicant's conduct and circumstances that do not 
reflect application of the whole person concept.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's family ties with relatives in Egypt were mitigated under Guideline B</SPAN>.  The Administrative 
Judge concluded that Applicant's family ties with relatives in Egypt were mitigated under Guideline B because his immediate family members are dual citizens 
in the United States who are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power, and his contacts and correspondence with other 
relatives who are Egyptian citizens living in Egypt are casual and infrequent.  Department Counsel contends the Judge erred because: (a) the record evidence 
does not support application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1; and (b) the record evidence does not support the Judge's favorable conclusions under 
Guideline B.  In response to Department Counsel's arguments, Applicant responds: (i) there is no record evidence that Applicant is in a position to be exploited 
by a foreign power; (ii) because Applicant's father holds a security clearance, he must have been determined to be free of foreign influence, and therefore, 
Applicant also must be found to be free of foreign influence; and (iii) the record evidence as a whole support the Judge's formal findings in favor of Applicant 
under Guideline B.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge concluded Applicant's immediate family members, who are dual Egyptian-U.S. citizens living in the United States are not agents of a 
foreign government or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power.  The Judge applied Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="01-16419.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> to Applicant's 
immediate family members.  With respect to Applicant's other relatives living in Egypt, the Judge concluded Applicant's contacts with them were minimal and 
warranted application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 3.<A HREF="01-16419.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Department Counsel contends the Judge erred because the record evidence does not 
support application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1, and the record evidence does not support the Judge's favorable conclusions under Guideline B.</P> 
 
<P>The Board does not find persuasive Applicant's argument that because his father holds a security clearance, he must have been determined to be free of foreign 
influence, and therefore, Applicant also must be found to be free of foreign influence.  The facts and circumstances of the adjudication of Applicant's father's 
security eligibility are not part of the record evidence in this case.  Absent such record evidence the Board declines to assign the significance to Applicant's 
father's possession of a security clearance that Applicant suggests.  Furthermore, even if the Board were to assume, solely for purposes of deciding this appeal, 
that appropriate federal officials made an affirmative determination as the security eligibility of Applicant's father with a full understanding of the family's 
overseas connections, such a determination would still not automatically benefit Applicant.  Applicant's security eligibility must be determined by evaluating 
the particular facts and circumstances of his  case.  There is no basis in the record for the Board to assume Applicant's situation is interchangeable with his 
father's.</P> 
 
<P>The Board does not have to agree with the Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions about Applicant's family ties to decide that Department Counsel 
has not met its burden on appeal of demonstrating the Judge erred with respect to this aspect of the case.  Department Counsel's appeal arguments are not 
persuasive.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel has met its burden on appeal of demonstrating error that warrants reversal.  Pursuant to Item E3.1.33.3 of the Directive's Additional 
Procedural Guidance, the Board reverses the Administrative Judge's favorable security clearance decision.</P>
