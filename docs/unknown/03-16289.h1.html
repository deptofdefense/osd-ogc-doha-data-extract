</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant has a history of delinquent debts she accrued following her discharge from the military in 2000 and ensuing divorce that left her as the sole provider 
for her young son with negligible child support from her ex-husband.  Applicant has since discharged all of her debts in bankruptcy and mitigates security 
concerns associated with her delinquent debts.  She successfully refutes allegations of falsification of her security clearance application (SF-86) as well.  
Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 13, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on August 23, 2004, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on October 8, 2004, and was scheduled for hearing 
on December 8, 2004.  A hearing was convened on December 8, 2004, for the purpose of considering whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of four exhibits; Applicant relied on three 
witnesses (including herself) and two exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on December 16, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to afford her the opportunity to supplement the record with a copy of her 
bankruptcy discharge order.  There being no objection from the Government, and good cause being demonstrated, Applicant was granted 20 days to supplement 
the record.  The Government was afforded 10 days to respond.  Within the permitted time, Applicant furnished a copy of her bankruptcy discharge, which was 
admitted as Applicant's exhibit C.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>.</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to incurred delinquent debts, five in all totaling more than $8,000.00.  Under Guideline E, she is alleged to have 
falsified her security clearance application (SF-86) of March 2003 by omitting a wage garnishment, as well as debts over 180 and 90 days delinquent, 
respectively.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the listed debts and claimed they were all included in her bankruptcy petition.  She denied falsifying 
her SF-86.  In explanation, she claimed she did not realize seizure of her income tax refund qualified as a wage garnishment when answering question 34 of the 
questionnaire.  She claimed she didn't think she needed to separately list debts 90 days delinquent when responding to question 39 that she previously included 
in her answers to question 38.  And she claimed she was never a member of the Navy but forgot to list the one-half unpaid portion of her enlistee bonus on the 
questionnaire that she had included in her original paperwork.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 23-year-old part-time security guard for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR, and admitted to 
by Applicant, are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant enlisted in the Army following her graduation from high school in June 1999.  Her boyfriend from high school enrolled in college during her senior 
year, but quit school after she joined the Army to be close to her.  Shortly after they were married (in January 2000), she gave birth to a son,  which her husband 
(H) helped support for awhile with various construction jobs (R.T., at 65-687).  Assured of sufficient income support to support her new family through her 
military pay and recruitment bonus (around $4,000.00), she purchased a vehicle for $6,385.00 in February 2000 through her Army credit union (<EM>see</EM> ex. 4; R.T., 
at 39).  H proved to be financially irresponsible, however, and Applicant soon found difficulty keeping up with her expenses required to support herself and her 
son.  She sought and obtained an early discharge for financial hardship in about April 2001 (ex. 1; R.T., at 67-68). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After being discharged from the Army, Applicant encountered difficulty finding good paying jobs and accumulated considerable debts which she could not pay 
in a timely way.  Most of these debts were medically-related to the care of her son and treatment of her damaged knee (R.T., at 39-40, 51-53).  Without 
sufficient resources of her own to keep up with her car payments, her car was repossessed in September 2001 (<EM>see</EM> exs. 2 and 4; R.T., at 55-56).  Citing she no 
longer possessed the car when asked about her repayment intentions in an ensuing DSS interview (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2), she indicated no intention to take care of the 
remaining balance at the time of the repossession.  However, she was not asked about any notice from the creditor of any proceeds from resale of the vehicle or 
amount of the remaining deficiency.  For lack of information in the record as to what her repossessed vehicle was sold for at auction by the repossessing seller, 
it is unclear how much of the unpaid carried balance reflected in her credit report represents the owed deficiency.  Quite possibly, the deficiency (if any) was 
small.  Assessed in this context, her expressed declination to pay off the  loan balance is not unreasonable.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's other listed debts comprise medical debts for the most part.  They are covered by creditors 1.b and 1.c and are associated with the medical needs of 
her son and herself, respectively, that were not covered by medical insurance.  The only other accumulated debt of Applicant's is a phone bill owed to creditor 
1.d in the amount of $139.00.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since her military discharge, Applicant received no financial support from H, and they divorced in December 2002 (ex. 1).  Although H was ordered to pay 
child support, he has never </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">payed more than $500.00 and currently is $12,000.00 in arrearage (R.T., at 48-49).  Wage garnishment of H's wages has proven to 
be unsuccessful due to his constant moving and cash basis for getting compensated.  Without either help from H or adequate income sources of her own to take 
care of her monthly needs, Applicant's debts became delinquent.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Unable to address her delinquent debts with her available resources from her part time security guard position, Applicant petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
relief in August 2004.  All of her listed delinquent debts were included in her bankruptcy petition (<EM>see</EM> ex. A).  She received her discharge in January 2005 (ex. 
B).   Applicant is currently up to date with all of her existing debts and expects to stay current.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Asked to complete an SF-86 in March 2003, Applicant omitted two debts on which her wages had been garnished when answering question 34 of her 
questionnaire.  She attributes her garnishment omission to a misunderstanding over whether the garnishment as used in the question encompassed attachment of 
her tax refund to satisfy recoupment of one-half of her Army bonus returnable due to her early discharge (R.T., at 41-45, 57-58).  She attributes the omissions of 
her delinquent debts over 90 days delinquent when answering question 39 to confusion at the time whether she needed to separately list the delinquent debts she 
had included in her answer to question 38 (R.T., at 42-43).  And she attributes her failure to list the Navy debt when answering question 38 to he inadvertent 
failure to transfer the debt information she had included in her work up paperwork to her SF-86 (R.T., at 43).   Applicant's omissions, while not knowing and 
wilful, do reflect some due diligence lapses on her part in thoroughly reading question 39 and tracing her Army bonus debt from her preliminary paperwork to 
her SF-86.  When asked about her debts in an ensuing DSS interview a month later, she made the necessary corrections.  Whether her answers were influenced 
by anything shown her by the interviewing agent is unclear from both her signed, sworn statement and her hearing testimony (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2).   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is well regarded by her supervisor who characterizes as a model employee.  She  is credited with meritorious work performance in her part time 
security guard duties.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance 
and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from 
the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently failed to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant accrued a number of delinquent debts during a strained marriage that ended in divorce with court-ordered child support. With inadequate income to 
match her expenses as a single mother with virtually no child support from her ex-husband, Applicant settled on discharging her debts in 2004 through Chapter 
7 bankruptcy relief and obtained  her discharge in January 2005. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Omissions of wage garnishment and debts over 90 and 180 days delinquent, respectively, raise 
additional potential security concerns about Applicant's reliability and trustworthiness that are addressed favorably.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and her husband accrued a number of delinquent debts before their divorce in 2002: mostly the result of a repossessed vehicle Applicant could no 
longer afford following her divorce and numerous medical debts associated with herself and her young son, for whom she was the sole provider, sans child 
support for the most part.  Without either child support or  insurance to cover her son's medical bills, she could not pay them in a timely way.  Because the 
deficiency from her repossessed car was not developed enough in the record to be able to pin point just what was owed following the seller's assumed disposal 
of the vehicle at auction, her liability to creditor 1.a is not fully assessable.  Still, Applicant listed the owed amount on her bankruptcy schedule of unsecured 
creditors, and any debt owing to creditor 1.a was fully discharged in Applicant's Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  On the strength of the evidence presented, the 
Government may invoke two Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations: E2.A6.1.2.1 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>A history of not meeting 
financial obligations</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) and E2.A6.1.2.3 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Clearly, Applicant's debts can be traced to extenuating circumstances associated with her poor marriage that left her with child rearing responsibilities with 
negligible support from her ex-husband and little income of her own.  Mitigation is present, too, as demonstrated by her bankruptcy discharge and ensuing 
stabilization of her personal finances.  Applicant may take advantage of E2.A.6.1.3.3 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the 
person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines to extenuate her debt delinquencies.  She may also avail herself of the mitigation benefits of E2.A6.1.3.6 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The individual initiated good-faith efforts 
to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) based on her successful resolution of her debt through federally sanctioned bankruptcy relief.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all of the circumstances of Applicant's accumulated debts and the good- faith efforts she demonstrated in resolving her delinquent debts 
resulting from extenuating conditions, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e as to the allegations governed by the 
Adjudicative Guidelines pertinent to Guideline F.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Posing potential security concerns, too, are Applicant's documented omissions of her covered delinquent debts from the SF-86 she completed in March 2003.  
Her omissions are, however, attributable to both her mistaken understanding of questions 34 and 39 and her inadvertent failure to list her credit union debt 
among her listed debts covered by question 38.  Applicant's explanations of her omissions (misreading the question) were persuasive enough to avert inferences 
of knowing and wilful omission and enable her to refute the allegations of falsification of her SF-86 covered in subparagraphs 2.a through 2.c (governed by 
Guideline E).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2.1 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P>
