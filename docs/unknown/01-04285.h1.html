<P>The Applicant was born in Trinidad and Tobago<A HREF="01-04285.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and became a naturalized US citizen in 1978.  Although the Applicant has siblings and in-laws living in 
foreign countries, this fact does not require denial of his clearance because his contacts with them are casual and infrequent, and they could not force Appellant 
to choose between loyalty to them and the United States.  In February 1998, the Applicant reapplied for dual citizenship with the country of his birth because he 
wanted to be able to go back home to work and stay indefinitely.  The Applicant currently holds dual citizenship with the US and Trinidad and Tobago.  
Because the Applicant decided to reestablish his foreign citizenship, clearance is denied.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On February 23, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-04285.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  In a response 
dated March 20, 2001, the Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. </P> 
<P>On July 10, 2001, the Applicant received a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) dated June 8, 2001, and was given the opportunity to file 
objections and submit material in extenuation, mitigation, or refutation.  The Applicant responded<A HREF="01-04285.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> to the FORM on August 20, 2001.  I was assigned the case 
on August 24, 2001.  The Department Counsel presented five exhibits (Items) in the FORM.  The record in this case closed on August 20, 2001.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The SOR alleges foreign influence (Guideline B) and foreign preference (Guideline C).  The Applicant admitted some of the allegations and added explanation 
to subparagraph 2.b. without admitting or denying the allegation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant is 63 years old and has worked for a defense contractor since December 1996. He had previously worked for another defense contractor starting 
in September 1984.  He is seeking to maintain a secret security clearance.  The Applicant cites his 15 years of dedicated service as justification for maintaining 
his clearance.  The Applicant feels equal loyalty to the US and Trinidad and Tobago. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant was born in Trinidad and Tobago.  In 1966, at the age of 27, the Applicant moved to the US Virgin Islands (VI).  In August 1978, he became a 
naturalized US citizen.  At the time he became a US citizen renounced his citizenship with Trinidad and Tobago.  His spouse is a citizen of the US and Trinidad 
and Tobago residing in the VI.  She became a naturalized US citizen in December 1994, but did not renounce her Trinidad and Tobago citizenship.  The 
Applicant's two sons are US citizens living in the US.  One son currently serves in the US Navy.  The Applicant's grandchildren are US citizens. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant's brother (retired), his mother-in-law (unemployed), two sisters-in-law (a bank employee and unemployed), and two brothers-in-law (a power 
company employee and retired) reside in Trinidad.  He has weekly telephone contact with his mother-in-law and sister-in-law.  He talks with his brother 
telephonically once a month.  He has yearly contact with one brother-in-law and no contact with his other brother-in-law.  He contacts his relatives during his 
yearly visits to Trinidad and Tobago. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant has two brothers (a telephone company employee and a national lottery employee), a sister (unknown employment, if any), and a sister-in-law 
(unknown employment, if any) who live in Canada.  His contact with them is limited.  He has telephonic contact with his siblings once a year and no contact 
with his sister-in-law.  He has never visited them in Canada.  In the past ten years they have not visited him.  Although the relatives reside in foreign countries, 
their citizenship can not be determined from the FORM, except for one of his brothers who has US residence status.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant visited Trinidad and Tobago once a year from 1990 through 1994, in 1996,  1998, and 2000.  He visited Trinidad and Tobago four times in 1995, 
twice in 1997.  In 1999, the Applicant made two trips of two weeks each to Trinidad and Tobago.  The trips were made to visit his family.  He intends to 
continue his yearly trips to Trinidad and Tobago.  On the Applicant's Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) dated September 1999, in response to 
question 16 asking the Applicant which foreign countries he had visited in the previous seven years only the two trips made in 1999 were listed.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant holds dual citizenship with the US and Trinidad and Tobago.  In February 1998, the Applicant reapplied for citizenship with Trinidad and 
Tobago because he wanted to be able to go back home and stay indefinitely. (Item 5, page 2). If not a citizen, visitors are asked how long they intend to stay.  
The Applicant wanted to be able to stay indefinitely without being asked.  He wants to be able to work and reside in Trinidad indefinitely after he retires from 
his present employment.  The cost of living is cheaper there, than in his current location.  Additionally, the Applicant considers Trinidad and Tobago "home."  
The Applicant's decision to become a dual citizen was to make his life easier after retirement. (Item 3)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant has a US passport, issued in April 1994, which is stamped indicating the Applicant is a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago through "restoration.<A HREF="01-04285.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN>" 
(Item 5, page 2) The Applicant states he is unwilling to renounce his foreign citizenship if requested to do so unless it is for "political reasons." The Applicant 
does not explain what he means by "political reasons." </P> 
<P>The Applicant has never served in a foreign military and has no rights, privileges, or obligations to Trinidad and Tobago.  He owns no foreign real estate but 
does have a savings account in a bank in Trinidad and Tobago.  He does not maintain his dual citizenship to protect financial interests. </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not only has the 
burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also demonstrate the facts proven have a nexus to an Applicant's security worthiness.</P> 
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance 
is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P> </P> 
<P>Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</P> 
<P>Foreign Preference (Guideline C)  The Concern:  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, 
then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. </P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </P> 
<P>  </P> 
<P>   1.  The exercise of dual citizenship.  E2.A3.1.2.1.</P> 
<P>4.  Accepting educational, medical, or other benefits, such as retirement and social welfare, from a foreign country.  E2.A3.1.2.4. </P> 
<P> Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </P> 
<P>None Apply</P> 
<P>Foreign Influence (Guideline B)  The Concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to 
whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial 
interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
<P>1.  An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country. E2.A2.1.2.1. </P> 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </P> 
<P>1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are 
not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
person(s) involved and the United States. E2.A2.1.3.1.  </P> 
<P>3.  Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent. E2.A2.1.3.3.</P> 
<P> </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets that burden, the 
burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant who must remove that doubt and establish his security suitability with substantial evidence in explanation, 
mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant or continue his security clearance. </P> 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge 
understands the Court's rationale, doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Under Guideline C, the security eligibility of an applicant is placed into question when an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign 
country over the United States; he or she may then be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. </P> 
<P>The Applicant holds dual citizenship with the US and Trinidad and Tobago.  In February 1998, the Applicant reapplied for citizenship with Trinidad and 
Tobago because he wanted to be able to go back home and stay indefinitely. As a resident he has the benefit of being able to work and reside in Trinidad 
indefinitely without being asked how long he intends to stay.  He made the decision to become a dual citizen to make his life easier after retirement from his 
present job.  The Applicant has been a naturalized citizen since 1978 but still considers Trinidad and Tobago home.  His US passport indicates the Applicant is 
a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago through restoration. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1<A HREF="01-04285.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN> applies. </P> 
<P>The Applicant has chosen to reestablish his foreign citizenship for "other benefits" from a foreign country, DC 4.<A HREF="01-04285.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Although the benefit the Applicant receives 
is not educational, medical, or social welfare it is still a benefit.  He is allowed to work and reside in Trinidad indefinitely without being questioned. </P> 
<P>None of the Mitigating Conditions (MC) apply.  The Applicant's dual citizenship is not based </P> 
<P>solely on his parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country (MC 1) because the Applicant took specific action in 1998 to reapply for his foreign citizenship 
after becoming a naturalized US citizen 21 years earlier.  Since his indication of foreign preference occurred after obtaining US citizenship, MC 2 does not 
apply.  The activity is not sanctioned by the United States (MC 3).  The Applicant has not expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship. (MC 4)  In fact 
the Applicant has stated he is unwilling to renounce his foreign citizenship if requested to do so, unless it was for "political reasons," a term the Applicant does 
not explain. </P> 
<P>Because the Applicant has decided to reestablish his citizenship with Trinidad and Tobago and none of the mitigating conditions apply, I find against the 
Applicant as to SOR subparagraph 1.a. and 1.b. </P> 
<P>  The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline B, (Foreign Influence).  Under Guideline B, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when the person has immediate family members who are citizens of and/or residing in a foreign country. A security risk may exist where 
the Applicant is bound by affection, influence, or obligation to individuals who are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  The 
Applicant's immediate family, i.e., spouse, sons and grandchildren, are US citizens living in the US.  His wife, although a naturalized US citizen, is also a 
citizen of Trinidad and Tobago.  I find the Applicant's wife is not an agent of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the United States.  MC 1<A HREF="01-04285.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN> applies. I find for the Applicant as to SOR 
subparagraph 2.a. </P> 
<P>The Applicant has numerous siblings and in-laws which reside in and are citizens of foreign countries.  The Applicant's brother, his mother-in-law, two sisters-in-law, and two brothers-in-law reside in Trinidad and two brothers, a sister, and a sister-in-law live in Canada. The FORM establishes where these individuals 
live but not their citizenship.  The Applicant visits his mother-in-law and sister-in-law on a yearly basis and has weekly telephone contact with them.  His visits 
to them are casual and infrequent.  His telephone contact is casual but frequent.  Both of these in-laws are unemployed.  There is no indication they are agents 
of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to his mother-in-law 
and sister-in-law and the United States.  I find for the Applicant as to SOR subparagraph 2.b. </P> 
<P>The Applicant's contact with his relatives living in Canada is limited or non existent.  He has telephonic contact with his Canadian siblings once a year and no 
contact with his sister-in-law. He has no contact with one of his brothers-in-law in Trinidad, yearly contact with his other brother-in-law, and monthly 
telephonic contact with his brother in Trinidad.  MC 3<A HREF="01-04285.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN> applies to the Applicant's contacts with his brother and sister-in-law residing in Trinidad.  I find for the 
Applicant as to SOR subparagraph 2.c. </P> 
<P>The Applicant cites his 15 years of dedicated service as justification for maintaining his clearance.  The Applicant's duty performance is not an issue in this 
case. His point concerning his duty performance is not frivolous, but it is misplaced.  An Applicant's security suitability is not determined solely on the basis of 
his job performance but more often includes consideration of other factors unrelated to job performance.  The fact the Applicant had been employed with a 
defense firm and has a good duty performance at that company, is not sufficient in and of itself to require a ruling in the Applicant's favor.</P> 
<P> </P> 
<P>  In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability the circumstance 
or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </P>
