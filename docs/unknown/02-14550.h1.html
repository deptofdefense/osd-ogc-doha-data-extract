<P>Thirty-three-year-old employee of a defense contractor incurred several debts, including a large debt to the IRS, as a result of his failed business partnership.

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 4 September 2003, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-14550.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-14550.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 14 October 2003 and elected to have 
a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 4 November 2003.  On 25 November 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 
4 December 2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 33-year-old machinery installer for a defense contractor.  He separated from the U.S. Army in 1997 after serving over eight years on active duty.  
Ex. 1 at 1; Tr. 8.  In that year, he and a friend started a business that bought old houses, renovated them, and then rented or sold them.  The friend had the 
money, and owned 51 percent of the partnership.  Applicant owned 49 percent and provided sweat equity.  Eventually the business expanded to include real 
estate and mortgage services.  The business struggled to make a profit as Applicant's partner opened a bar and lost focus on the primary business.  As the 
business declined, Applicant went without a salary causing him to rely on credit cards to pay his family's expenses.  He has been unable to pay these credit card 
debts.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant failed to pay his income taxes for 1997-2000.  As a result, the IRS filed a tax lien</P> 
 
<P>against him.  Although Applicant entered into an installment agreement with the IRS to pay off these debts, his payments have not even offset the accumulating 
interest owed.  Applicant has retained an attorney to file for bankruptcy, but no filing has been made.  </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant has delinquent debts (&para;&para; 1.a.-1.c.); a federal tax lien in the amount of $37,964 against him (&para; 1.d.); and his monthly 
expenses consume all of his income, preventing him from paying his delinquent debts (&para; 1.e.).  An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having 
to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations.  DC E2.A6.1.2.1.  He has been unable to satisfy his debts.  DC E2.A6.1.2.3.  However, it 
appears that the conditions that resulted in the debts were largely beyond Applicant's control as they were caused by the failure of his business.  MC 
E2.A6.1.3.3.  Applicant claims that his largest debt, the amount owed to the IRS that has been turned into a tax lien, was caused by his partner funneling funds 
for another business through the partnership.  Applicant says this inflated the income he was required to report to the IRS.  Applicant has made some efforts to 
resolve his financial difficulties.  E2.A6.1.3.6.  In April 2003, he consulted an attorney about filing for bankruptcy and he entered into an installment agreement 
to pay his tax debt to the IRS.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After weighing both the favorable and unfavorable evidence, I find against Applicant.  Of primary consideration is the debt to the IRS.  Applicant failed to pay 
his taxes for four years (from 1997-2000) and has done little to rectify this problem.  Although he entered into an installment agreement, he is no longer paying 
while he and his attorney ponder whether to file for bankruptcy and under which chapter.  Interest on the IRS debt has raised the total tax indebtedness from 
$37,000 to over $41,000.  There is no evidence Applicant has tried to resolve his other debts.  Applicant failed to convince me it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant him a clearance.</SPAN></P>

<P>In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
