<P>Applicant is a utility technician for a defense contractor.  In 1999, Applicant's debts were discharged in bankruptcy.  She continued to accumulate delinquent 
debt, and she again petitioned for discharge in bankruptcy in January 2004.  She acknowledged delinquent debts, but did not provide information to mitigate the 
security concerns for  financial considerations.  Applicant deliberately did not include a vehicle repossession in response to a question on her security clearance 
application.  Applicant has not mitigated security concerns under Guidelines F and E.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On December 31, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a 
security clearance for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(February 20, 1990), 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (January 2, 1992), 
as amended and modified (Directive).  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 26, 2004.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations ) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in an undated response admitting the allegations under Guideline F and denying the allegation under Guideline E.  She elected to 
have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.</P> 
<P>Department Counsel submitted the government's written case on October 26, 2004.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on 
November 7, 2004, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  Her 
response was due December 8, 2004, but as of December 29, 2004, she had not responded.  The case was assigned to another administrative judge on December 
29, 2004, and reassigned to me on May 5, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 55-year-old utility technician for a defense contractor.  She was granted a security clearance in 1976.  Applicant and her husband petitioned for 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 1998, and their debts were discharged on February 24, 1999.  Applicant and her husband continued to have financial 
problems after the discharge in bankruptcy, and they again petitioned for bankruptcy in January 2004.<A HREF="03-02034,h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant provided no further information on this 
bankruptcy.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">There are four debts alleged in the SOR under Guideline F.  Debt 1.a. in the SOR is for an unpaid judgment resulting from a credit card debt Applicant has not 
paid off or satisfied.  Applicant acknowledged this debt but provided no information on the status of the debt.  Debt 1.b. in the SOR is for medical care in a 
hospital.  Applicant acknowledges the debt, has stated she would pay it off,  but has provided no information on the status of the debt.<A HREF="03-02034,h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Debt 1.c. in the SOR is 
for delinquent mortgage payments for Applicant's residence.  Applicant acknowledged this debt but provided no information on the status of the debt.  Debt 
1.d. in the SOR is the remainder of a debt owed on a vehicle repossessed in 1998.<A HREF="03-02034,h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The vehicle was included in the 1998 discharge in bankruptcy as exempt 
property.  Subsequent credit reports note that the vehicle was listed in the bankruptcy.<A HREF="03-02034,h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  SOR 1.e. is the 1998 bankruptcy.<A HREF="03-02034,h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant attributes her and her husband's financial problems to her husband's medical condition that occasionally prevents him from working.  Applicant's 
husband is self-employed in a lawn care business.  She admits they do not put resources aside to cover times her husband cannot work.<A HREF="03-02034,h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In her March 2000 security clearance application, Applicant answered "No" to question 35 asking if she had any repossessions in the last seven years.  In fact, 
Applicant's vehicle was repossessed in 1998 and debt remaining from the repossession was addressed in the 1998 bankruptcy discharge.<A HREF="03-02034,h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently 
trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."<A HREF="03-02034,h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant 
meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.<A HREF="03-02034,h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each guideline.  Each 
clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, 
and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable information about 
the person.<A HREF="03-02034,h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to 
include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the  
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.<A HREF="03-02034,h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="03-02034,h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN>  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the 
Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible 
for access to classified information.<A HREF="03-02034,h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  Thereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-02034,h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN>  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="03-02034,h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN>  "[T]he Directive 
presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."<A HREF="03-02034,h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN>  "Any 
doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." <A HREF="03-02034,h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
<P>Guideline F - Financial Considerations: A security concern exists for an individual who is financially irresponsible.  An individual who is financially 
irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in 
one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</P> 
<P>Guideline E - Personal Conduct: A security concern exists for conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty<EM>, </EM>or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  Any of these characteristics in a person could indicate that the person may not properly 
safeguard classified information.</P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guidelines are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the 
SOR.</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline F.  Applicant's delinquent debts brings the matter within Financial Considerations Disqualifying 
Conditions Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>), and Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>).  
Applicant's debts were discharged in bankruptcy in 1999.  By 2003, Applicant had accumulated more delinquent debt, and she again petitioned for a discharge 
in bankruptcy in January 2004.  Bankruptcy is a legal and permissible means of resolving debts.  However, a discharge in bankruptcy  does not preclude 
consideration of the security significance of the actions leading to the delinquent debts.<A HREF="03-02034,h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  This repeated indebtedness and two bankruptcy petitions in five years 
shows a history of not meeting financial obligations and an unwillingness or inability to satisfy debts.  The debt for the vehicle should have been eliminated in 
the discharge in bankruptcy and Applicant does not owe this debt.  The above disqualifying conditions have been established as to allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., 
and 1.e.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has not presented any information to mitigate the disqualifying conditions for financial concerns.  She has not presented sufficient information to 
raise the Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.3 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's 
control (e.g. loss of employment . . .unexpected medical emergency)</EM>).  While she states her husband has a medical condition that occasionally prevents him from 
working, she presents no information establishing how often he is unable to work and the extent it affects their finances.  Applicant has not present information 
to establish Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition Directive E2.A6.1.3.6 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts</EM>).  Applicant has turned twice to bankruptcy to resolve her financial problems.  While bankruptcy is a legal means of resolving debt, the 
underlying circumstance is Applicant continues to accumulate delinquent debt.  She has not attempted to resolve her indebtedness by restructuring her finances, 
paying past due creditors, or otherwise trying to satisfy her debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case under Guideline E.  Applicant's "NO" answer to question 35 regarding any repossessions in the last seven years brings 
the matter under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.2 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and 
material facts from any personal security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations. . . determine security 
clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . . </EM>).  There was a vehicle repossessed in 1998 and the remaining debt was addressed in the 1998 bankruptcy.  
Applicant's explanation for the false answer falls far short of establishing the Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.3 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the falsification 
was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual subsequently provided correct information voluntarily</EM>).  Applicant's explanation for the false 
answer was she had no reason to lie and her answer was an error.  The vehicle was repossessed shortly before Applicant completed the application and it was 
addressed in the bankruptcy.  It was a fact well known to Applicant and she has not provided a valid reason for omitting the information.  I conclude Applicant 
deliberately omitted the information from her security clearance application.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept.  I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
