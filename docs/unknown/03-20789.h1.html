<P>The Applicant has addressed, or is in the process of addressing, all of the alleged past due debts.  One of the four debts has been paid, and he is making 
payments towards the other three alleged past due debts.  I find no willful falsification here.  When the Applicant executed his November 2002 Security 
Clearance Application (SCA), he disclosed a motor vehicle repossession, but was unaware of that the other three debts were past due.  Mitigation is shown.  
Guidelines E and F are found for the Applicant.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 21, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on October 14, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on February 22, 2005.  A notice of hearing had already been issued on February 1, 2005, as this case had previously 
been assigned to another judge, and the case was heard on February 23, 2004.  The Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from 
the Applicant, who also submitted documentary evidence.  The transcript (TR) was received on March 4, 2005.  The issues raised here are whether the 
Applicant's Financial Considerations and alleged Personal Conduct militate against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant only admits the 
underlying factual basis of the department store debt, 1.b.  He denies all the other allegations.]</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">46 years of age, and is 
employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was maintaining two households, one in the U.S. and one in Korea (TR at page 19 line 23 to page 21 line 10).  All of his alleged past due debts 
were incurred prior to the Applicant retiring from the active duty Army and moving to Korea as a contractor (<EM>Id</EM>).  By far his largest debt was for his motor 
vehicle which the title holder would not permit the Applicant to take it to Korea (<EM>Ibid</EM>).  He now has a positive monthly cash flow of between $700 and $800 
(TR at page 21 lines 11~15).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  The Applicant has paid a $75 debt to a cable television provider (TR at page 14 lines 15~22, and Applicant's Exhibit (AppX) C at page 4).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b.  The Applicant has paid $194 towards a $430 debt to a department store (TR at page 16 lines 8~20, at page 35 lines 1~22, and AppX C at page 3).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c.  The Applicant has increased his monthly payments from $125 to $250 towards a $3,287 debt to the military exchange (TR at page 16 line 22 to page 18 
line 9, at page 29 line 17 to page 31 line 3, and AppX C at pages 1 and 2).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d.  The Applicant is making monthly payments of $200 towards an $11,245 debt for a motor vehicle that was repossessed (TR at page 18 line 11 to page 19 
line 18, at page 23 line 16 to page 27 line 17, at page 28 line 13 to age 29 line 16, and AppX D at page 1).  The creditor is now willing to settle this debt for 
$8,500 (AppX D at page 1).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a. and 2.b.  In November of 2002, the Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA) (Government Exhibit (GX) 1).  He disclosed that his motor 
vehicle had been repossessed in answer to question 35, but was unaware he had any past due debts in excess of 90 or 180 days in answer to questions 38 and 39 
(TR at page 21 line 20 to page 22 line 8, at page 36 line 13 to page 38 line 1, and GX 1 at pages 7~8).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant immediate supervisor and his program manager both think most highly of the Applicant and would recommend his to a position of trust (AppXs 
A and B).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, 
as set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct), and F (Financial Considerations); which establishes doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to 
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Unacceptable Personal Conduct are conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all 
times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering first the Applicant's Financial Considerations, the first and third disqualifying conditions are applicable as the Applicant had a "history of not 
meeting [his] financial obligations," and there was an "[i]inabilty or unwillingness to satisfy [his] debts."  However, the Applicant has now either addressed or 
is in the process of addressing, through payments or payment plans, all of his alleged past due debts.  The last mitigating condition is therefore  applicable as he 
has "initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts."  Mitigation is shown.  Guideline F is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to his alleged wilful falsification, I can find no intent to keep information from the Government.  When the Applicant filled out his SCA, he disclosed the 
repossession.  He was unaware that he had any past due debts in excess of 90 or 180 days.  The Applicant's credibility is attested to by both his immediate 
supervisor and his program manager.  He thus answered the posited questions truthfully and to the best of his ability.  Guideline E is also found for the 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his Financial Considerations, and his Personal Conduct.  The 
Applicant has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines E and F, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of 
persuasion under Guidelines E and F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></SPAN></P>
