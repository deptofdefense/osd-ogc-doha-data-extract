<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On December 15, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of 
the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant 
requested a hearing.  On June 26, 2006, after the hearing,  Administrative Judge Barry M. Sax denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed the Judge's unfavorable 
clearance decision.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal brief contains no assertion of harmful error on the part of the Judge.  Rather, it contains new evidence, in the form of a statement from the Applicant, which indicates that by the 
time the decision was issued Applicant had paid off some of the debts listed in the SOR and was continuing to try to resolve her financial problems.  The Board cannot consider this new evidence 
on appeal.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.29.</P> 
 
<P>The Appeal Board's authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the Judge committed harmful error.  It does not review cases <EM>de novo</EM>. Applicant has not 
made an allegation of harmful error.   Therefore, the decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.</P>
