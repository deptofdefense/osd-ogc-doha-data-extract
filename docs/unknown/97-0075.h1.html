<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	On January 28, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could
not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral
to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or
revoked.</P>

<P>	Applicant responded to the SOR on February 13, 1997 and elected to have his case
determined on the basis of the written record.  Applicant was furnished copies of the File of Relevant
aterials (FORM) on March 19, 1997 and is credited with receiving them on April 1, 1997.  He
provided no written response within the time permitted (30 days) by the Directive.  The case was
assigned to this Administrative Judge on June 4, 1997.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>STATEMENT OF FACTS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Applicant is 32 year of age and has been employed by his current defense contractor
(Company A) since February 1995.  He seeks a security clearance at the level of secret.</P>

<P>	<STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></P>

<P>	Applicant is alleged to (1) have used and purchased marijuana from about 1982 to at least
1987; (2) exhibited signs of possible marijuana use in the future; and (3) have used cocaine, LSD
and psilocybin mushrooms.</P>

<P>	For his response, Applicant, admits, without explanation, each of the covered allegations,
save for his denial of any future intention to use marijuana in the future.</P>

<P>	<STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></P>

<P>	Applicant first tried marijuana at a party in junior high school; he was only 13 at the time. 
He did not use marijuana again until 1982, but quickly established a pattern of weekly use of the
substance between 1982 and 1987. His preference was to smoke it with a group of 5 to 6 friends in
and about the vicinity of his college campus.  He estimates to have regularly smoked the equivalent
of 3 to 4 marijuana cigarettes a week during this 5-year time frame.</P>

<P>	Applicant tapered his marijuana use considerably (<EM>i.e., </EM>to monthly use) between 1987 and
1988 and reduced his use even more for the 7 years spanning 1988 and 1995.  Between 1988 and
December, 1995 he estimates to have used the substance some 30 times <EM>en totale</EM>, typically smoking
1/4 to 1/2 of a joint on each occasion when in the company of friends or at parties.  Applicant admits
to using marijuana because he enjoyed its affects.  He assures in his October 21, 1996 signed, sworn
statement to DIS that he will not seek out marijuana in the future and reiterates his disclaimers in
his February 12, 1996 letter (attached to his response) .  Still, he hedges some on his refusing offered
marijuana at future parties.  In his October 21 statement, he concludes that he cannot state with
certainty that he won't try marijuana again should it be offered to him at a party in the future, a
statement he makes no attempt to revise in his February 12 letter or correct in a FORM response. 
Though not an express indication of resumption intention, his reservations about the future do open
possibilities for his returning to marijuana use.</P>

<P>	To satisfy his personal marijuana needs in high school and his early college years, Applicant
oft-purchased marijuana.  His purchases were regular between 1982 and 1987, a period in which he
typically contributed $25.00 to $30.00 a week towards the purchase of an ounce of marijuana, which
he, in turn, divided among his use participants.  Applicant never purchased marijuana again after
1987, always relying on others to give it to him in the ensuing years. </P>

<P>	Besides marijuana, Applicant tried other drugs.  He experimented with cocaine, LSD, and
psilocybin (mushrooms) on a few occasions in the distant past (over 7 years ago) and assures he will
not use or purchase any of these drugs again.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>POLICIES</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Adjudication Guidelines of the Directive (Change 3) lists "binding" policy
considerations to be made by Judges in the decision making process of most all DOHA cases. The
term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the Judge to consider all of the
"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying
Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not
a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  It does not require the Judge to assess
these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant adjudication guidelines,
judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation
set forth in F.3 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, as well as the Directive's preamble to Change 3,
which are intended to assist the judges in  reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy
factors are pertinent herein:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><U>Drug Involvement (Criterion H)</U></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">Disqualifying Conditions</U>:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	1.  Any drug abuse.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	2.  Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale,
or distribution;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	3.  Failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by a credentialed
medical professional; current drug involvement, especially following the granting of a security
clearance, or an expressed intent not to discontinue use, will normally result in an unfavorable
determination.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	<U>Mitigating Conditions</U>:   </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	1.  The involvement was not recent.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	2.  The drug involvement was an isolated or infrequent event.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><U>Burdens of Proof</U></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	By dint of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an
Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do
so is <U>clearly</U> <U>consistent</U> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative
Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate
determination of an applicant's suitability for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the
relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw
only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Put
another way, the Judge cannot draw inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controversial fact[s]
alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a nexus
to the applicant's inability to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of
nexus, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant
has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of accessible risks that an applicant may
deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or
controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his or
her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the
Government's case.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><STRONG><U>CONCLUSION</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant comes with a history of substance abuse that traces to 1978: A period of some 17
years.  Over time, his use of marijuana has vacillated from isolated use, to a period of characterized
regular use (<EM>viz., </EM>a 5-year stretch spanning 1982 and 1987.  During this concentrated period of
marijuana use, Applicant regularly contributed to marijuana purchases to satisfy his personal needs. 
Thereafter, he cut back his marijuana use to monthly (to 1988), to once or twice a year between 1988
and 1995, and finally to sustained abstinence since December, 1995 (a period of some 18 months). 
Troubling still are Applicant's reservations about his accepting marijuana at future parties.  Given
the opportunity to respond to the Government's FORM, Applicant declined to redress the
Government's active concerns about his unwillingness to disclaim any and all resumption intentions. 
Foreclosing any intentions of pursuing marijuana in the future represents good progress on the road
to self-imposed abstinence, but it is not enough to absorb all of the Government's concerns about
his returning to marijuana use.  Applicant's qualified disclaimer (as written) is indicative of an
expressed intention not to discontinue his marijuana use and warrants the invoking of DC 3 of the
Adjudication Guidelines (for drug abuse).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Considered together, Applicant's record of marijuana use and purchases over a considerable
time, coupled with his less than ringing demonstration of assured future discontinuance, is security
significant.  His brief history of experimental involvement with other illegal substances (<EM>i.e., </EM>cocaine,
LSD and mushrooms), while aged and infrequent, cannot be entirely discounted given Applicant's
more recent involvement with marijuana and reservation on future activity.  Government meets its
initial proof burden.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P>	To be sure, Applicant's marijuana activity in recent years has been on a steep decline and
does not pose any cognizable security risks in the short term.  But his hedges on future use are
disquieting and preclude any safe predictions about his staying off drugs in the future.  With barely
18 months of self-imposed discontinuance to his credit, reliable and trustworthy assurances against
future resumption became critical determinants in the balancing of the Government's entitlement to
safe risk assessments about Applicant's future away from drugs and Applicant's entitlement to being
fairly credited with  life-style changes in his involvement with illegal substances.  While Applicant
is entitled to the benefits of two of the mitigating conditions of the Adjudication Guidelines: MC 1
(non-recency) and MC 2 (infrequency in recent years), he may not take advantage of MC 3 (non-demonstrated intent to resume).  In the end, too many doubts remain about Applicant's commitment
to staying away from marijuana use to enable him to safely mitigate clearance concerns associated
with his history of marijuana use and purchases.  On the basis of this record, Applicant is unable to
sustain his burden of proof, and unfavorable conclusions warrant on the covered allegations of
marijuana use/purchases.  Only with respect to Applicant's aged and infrequent use of other illegal
substances (<EM>viz., </EM>cocaine, LSD and mushrooms) is he able to provide successful mitigation.</P>
