  Given the record evidence in this case, the Administrative Judge did not err by not applying Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6 to Applicant's history of financial difficulties.  As the trier of fact, the Judge had to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence  outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa.  Applicant's disagreement with some of the Judge's conclusions is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge  weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued the Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated February 28, 2003, which stated the reasons 
why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke Applicant's access to classified information.  The SOR was based upon Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E 
(Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley  issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated September 11, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issue: whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that the security concerns raised by Applicant's 
indebtedness had not been mitigated.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue<A HREF="02-07138.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that the security concerns raised by Applicant's indebtedness had not been mitigated</SPAN>.  On appeal, 
Applicant does not dispute the Judge's findings of fact with respect to his financial history.  Rather, Applicant contends the Judge should have concluded that 
the security concerns raised by his debts were mitigated by application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6.<A HREF="02-07138.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  For the reasons set forth below, 
we conclude Applicant has failed to demonstrate the Judge erred.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, the Applicant: (1) had under-withheld with respect to his contemporary tax liability in multiple years (thus creating new tax indebtedness) in order 
to use the funds to payoff past tax indebtedness, (2) had filed outstanding delinquent income tax returns for multiple years subsequent to the initiation of the 
security clearance process and the issuance of the SOR, and (3) was waiting to see what the results of his security clearance hearing would be before setting up 
payment arrangements with the Internal Revenue Service regarding his remaining tax indebtedness.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably 
conclude that although Applicant's actions had resulted in the payment of some of his older tax debts, they did not constitute the type of sustained record of 
timely financial payments needed to mitigate the security concerns raised by the Applicant's substantial and continuing tax indebtedness.</P> 
 
<P>With respect to the application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, the Board has previously discussed what constitutes a "good-faith" effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: "In order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant's debts.  The 
Directive does not define the term 'good-faith.' However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith 'requires a showing that a person acts in a way 
that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.'"  ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at pp. 5-6.</P> 
 
<P>Given the evidence of record, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to conclude that the Applicant's approach to resolving his extensive tax 
indebtedness lacked the requisite "reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation" sufficient to warrant the application of Mitigating 
Condition 6.</P> 
 
<P>Finally, the favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  As the 
trier of fact, the Judge had to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  
Applicant's disagreement with some of the Judge's  conclusions is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence as a whole in a manner that is 
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  There is ample record evidence to support the Judge's ultimate conclusion as to the Applicant's security suitability.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge made findings of fact and reached conclusions about Applicant's history of financial difficulties that reflect a plausible, legally 
permissible interpretation of the record evidence.  Given the Judge's findings and conclusions, he had a rational basis to conclude Applicant's overall history of 
financial difficulties raised security concerns under Guideline F, and to conclude that Applicant had failed to present sufficient evidence to overcome those 
security concerns.</P>

<P>Applicant has failed to demonstrate error below.  Therefore, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision.</P>
