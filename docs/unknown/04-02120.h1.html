<P>Applicant has a history of alcohol abuse that includes drinking to intoxication, alcohol-related incidents on and off the job site, and failure to follow prescribed 
protocols following treatment-discharge.  Applicant compounds judgment lapses associated with his history of alcohol abuse with a now-aged, non-alcohol 
related, arrest and his concealment of his alcohol-related arrests and treatment when completing his security clearance application.  Neither Applicant's 
judgment lapses associated with his abuse of alcohol, alcohol-related arrests, and failure to adhere to his treatment protocol, nor his omissions of his alcohol-related arrests and treatment in his security clearance application are mitigated and raise continuing  security concerns about his judgment and reliability.  
Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 15, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance, and recommended referral 
to an administrative judge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on April 12, 2005, and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant was furnished the File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) on January 16, 2004, and received it on June 30, 2005.  Applicant did not respond to the FORM.  The case was assigned to me 
August 24, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline G, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is alleged to have (1) consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from at least 1969 to at least 
December 2003, (2) been arrested for driving under the influence (DuI) on three occasions between 1969 and 1999, (3) been suspended for a week in December 
1994 after testing positive for intoxication on the job site in an administered breath test, (4) received treatment for diagnosed alcohol dependence at N Hospital 
in September 1999, and (5) continued consuming alcohol notwithstanding his treatment for alcohol dependence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his security clearance application (SF-86) of December 2002 by omitting (a) his three alcohol-related 
arrests and (b) his treatment for alcohol dependence.  Applicant's alleged suspension from work and DuI arrest of August 1999 are incorporated by reference.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J, Applicant's alleged alcohol-related arrests and omissions are incorporated by reference.  Under Guideline J, Applicant is alleged to have 
been arrested in February 1971 for breach of peace.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations.  He provided no explanations in connection with any of his admissions. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 58-year-old yard jockey for a defense contractor, who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by 
Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant regularly consumed alcohol between 1969 and December 2003.  He typically consumed between six and 12 beers on weekends, sometimes to the 
point of intoxication.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between 1969 and August 1999, Applicant was involved in four alcohol-related incidents, three of which were outside the work place.  Specifically, in 
February 1969, he was arrested and charged with DuI and failure to consent to a sobriety test.  He was fined $125.00 for the offense and had his license 
suspended for 30 days.  In April 1978, he was arrested and charged with operating while intoxicated, for which he was fined $150.00 and had his license 
revoked.  In a separate non-alcohol-related incident in February 1971, Applicant was charged with breach of the peace.  For this offense, he was fined $15.00.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a security guard with his employer reported smelling alcohol on Applicant's person at the latter's work site in December 1994, Applicant was escorted to 
his employer's hospital for alcohol testing.  The results of the breath test administered Applicant showed him to have been intoxicated while on the job.  As the 
result of the test findings, Applicant was suspended from work for one week.  He had been Christmas shopping before reporting for work and consumed alcohol 
to excess.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In August 1999, a gate guard detected alcohol on Applicant's breath and reported his observations to a local sheriff who was called to investigate. When he 
arrived, the sheriff administered a road side sobriety test on Applicant.  Applicant was then taken into custody by the sheriff and administered a breath test.  The 
test showed Applicant to be legally intoxicated.  Applicant was subsequently fined $50.00 for the offense.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following an argument with his wife in September 1999, Applicant fell down some stairs in their home and was knocked unconscious.  He was taken to a local 
hospital for treatment.  Before his release, his wife convinced him to accept transfer to an alcohol rehabilitation facility for alcohol-related treatment.  Once 
admitted to N Hospital, Applicant was evaluated by a credentialed physician and detoxified.  Medical notes report Applicant expressed concerns about his 
losing his job, family and wife if he did not stop drinking.  Unemployed at the time, he recognized he was on a self-destructive course with his drinking and 
agreed to continue outpatient treatment and participate in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).  At discharge, he was diagnosed with acute alcohol intoxication, 
alcohol dependence, alcohol withdrawal, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.  Medical notes indicate Appellant's mood and treatment motivation 
were much improved at discharge (<EM>see</EM> ex. 7).  Altogether, Applicant spent seven days in inpatient treatment at N Hospital.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since his discharge, Applicant continues to consume alcohol and provides no documented showing of whether or how long he participated in outpatient 
treatment and/or AA.  To what extent Applicant has been able to avert alcohol abuse since his inpatient discharge in September 1999 is unknown in the record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Asked to complete an SF-86 in December 2002, Applicant answered in the negative to both question 24 (inquiring about drug/alcohol-related offenses) and 
question 30 (inquiring about alcohol-related treatment or counseling within the previous seven years).   In denying any prior alcohol-related arrests and 
treatment, Applicant failed to disclose his three alcohol-related arrests in 1969, 1978, and 1999, respectively, and his alcohol-related treatment in September 
1999.  He provides no explanations in his answer as to why he omitted his arrests and treatment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When he was interviewed by DSS (in December 2003), Applicant fully disclosed his three alcohol-related arrests and treatment at N Hospital.  Whether or no 
he was confronted with his arrest and medical records is not clear.  Because the evidentiary burden rests on Applicant to demonstrate his omission corrections 
were made promptly and voluntarily, no favorable inferences can be drawn without probative documentation of prompt and voluntary corrections from 
Applicant. Applicant failed to furnish any probative documentation of prompt, voluntary corrections, and none may be inferred from this written record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the 
risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, lack of candor, dishonesty, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance 
and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from 
the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant presents with a long history of alcohol abuse that includes regular drinking to intoxication levels, several alcohol-related arrests, as well as an earlier 
breach of peace arrest, a work suspension, alcohol treatment for diagnosed alcohol dependence, and continued drinking in the face of his dependence diagnosis.  
Besides his arrests and history of excessive consumption of alcohol, Applicant falsified his 2002 SF-86 by omitting his alcohol-related arrests and treatment for 
alcohol dependence and associated alcohol problems.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Applicant's alcohol issues</STRONG>          </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Over a 30-year period , Applicant was involved in three alcohol-related incidents away from work and one work-related  incident.  After being fined $500.00 
following his August 1999 DuI conviction, Applicant entered an inpatient facility for a week of evaluation and treatment.  Despite recommendations from his 
medical providers to continue with outpatient treatment and participate in AA meetings, Applicant continued to drink. He provides no documentation in this 
administrative record that he ever continued with outpatient treatment or attended AA meetings.  On the strength of the evidence presented, four disqualifying 
condition (DC) of the Adjudication Guidelines for alcohol consumption may be applied: E2.A7. 1.2. <EM>(Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as 
driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use</EM>), E2.A7.1.2.2 (<EM>Alcohol-related incidents at 
work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job</EM>), E2.A7.1.2.3 (<EM>Diagnosis by a credentialed medical 
professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence</EM>), and E2.A7.1.2.5 (habitual or binge drinking). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By his actions to date, Applicant has not demonstrated he has learned from his judgment lapses associated with his alcohol-related incidents: He continues to 
drink while ignoring his medical provider's recommendations. Applicant's lack of any documented efforts to avert his past judgment lapses associated with his 
abuse of alcohol preclude  him from taking advantage of any of the mitigating conditions (MC) of the Adjudication Guidelines for alcohol consumption. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All in all, Applicant's efforts to date fail to reflect any  increased understanding about alcohol abuse, much less concerted actions to avoid future abuse.  His 
continued drinking over the past six years without any indications of participation in avoidance programs like outpatient therapy and AA reflects little judgment 
restoration. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the record as a whole, Applicant fails to make the convincing showing that he has both the maturity and resource support at his disposal to avert 
any recurrent problems with judgment lapses related to alcohol abuse in the future.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the alcohol-related 
allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.g of Guideline G. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Falsification issues</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Potentially serious and difficult to reconcile with the trust and reliability requirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of 
Applicant's alcohol-related arrests and treatment  omissions in his December 2002 SF-86.  So much trust is imposed on persons cleared to see classified 
information that judgment lapses associated with omissions are difficult to excuse.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By omitting his past alcohol-related arrests and treatment in his 2002 SF-86, Applicant concealed materially important background information needed for the 
government to properly process and evaluate his security updates.  He makes no claim of misunderstanding the questions, which were posed in a 
straightforward way in the questionnaire.  His omissions were knowing, deliberate, and material to a determination about his clearance suitability.  They invite 
application of Disqualifying Conditions (DC) for personal conduct of the Adjudicative Guidelines: E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, 
falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement or similar form used to 
conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award 
fiduciary responsibilities</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with,  since he failed to make any prompt voluntary corrections of his SF-86 omissions before sitting for a DSS 
interview a year later.  Not only has the Appeal Board found the use of Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A5.1.3.2 of the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal 
conduct (<EM>The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily</EM>) to be 
unavailable to applicants seeking mitigation by treating the omission as isolated, but it has denied applicants availability of E2.A5.1.3.3 <EM>(The individual made 
prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts</EM>) as well in circumstances (as here) where the applicant has failed to 
take advantage of an earlier DSS interview opportunity.  <EM>Compare </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0289 (January 1998) with DISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 1995).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available guidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E.2.2 factors), unfavorable conclusions 
warrant with respect to subparagraphs. 2.b and 2.c of Guideline E.  Applicant's alcohol-related work suspension in 1994 and 1999 DuI arrest reflect lapses in 
judgment that are part of a pattern of judgment impairment, too, that are not mitigated by any of the mitigating conditions in Guideline E or whole person 
assessment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Criminal coverage of falsification issues</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Both Applicant's three alcohol-related incidents and non-alcohol-related breach of peace arrest invite separate coverage of the criminal conduct guidelines of 
Guideline J.  Because his SF-86 omissions were never prosecuted in a criminal proceeding, their coverage is less obvious. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">That none of Applicant's SF-86 omissions resulted in formal charges and adjudication against Applicant does not mean that the falsification issues may not be 
raised and considered anew in a clearance proceeding such as the present.  The Appeal Board has repeatedly stated that the government can prove applicant 
engagement in criminal conduct, even in the absence of a criminal conviction.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 94-1213 (June 7, 1996).   Accordingly, two of the 
disqualifying conditions of the Adjudication Guidelines for criminal conduct may be invoked: E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct 
regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>) and E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Unlike Guideline E-covered omissions, Guideline J is designed to afford more recognition to an applicant's overall judgment and reliability history.  Still, an 
applicant must meet the requirements of at least some of the mitigation conditions if he is to successfully mitigate its related falsification parameters under 18 
U.S.C. Section 1001. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's belated coming forward with his full disclosure of his alcohol-related arrests and treatment a year later (<EM>i.e., </EM>in December 2003) in his interview 
represented a positive shift in his attitude about withholding his arrests and treatment information.  Given his admitted withholding his alcohol-related arrests 
and treatment in his clearance application, however, his disclosures, while commendable, are not enough to meet the mitigation requirement of evidenced clear 
rehabilitation to entitle him to take advantage of E2.A10.1.3.6 <EM>(There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>) of the Adjudication Guidelines at this time.  
ore time is needed before Applicant is in a position to make the case his rehabilitation efforts are sufficient to mitigate the criminally-related features of his 
alcohol-related arrest and treatment omissions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on a full review of the evidence and drawn inferences from the developed record, unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 3.a 
through 3.c of Guideline J as well.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative 
Guidelines of the Directive.</SPAN></P>
