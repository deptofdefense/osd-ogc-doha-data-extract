<P>Applicant <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is a 49 year-old naturalized United States citizen, born in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Vietnam</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He came to the United States in 1975,  and became a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">naturalized </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">United

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated November 
4,  2003, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct 
proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, or denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant<EM></EM> filed a notarized response dated December 9, 2003, to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative 
Judge. On February 4, 2004, the case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing. Pursuant to formal notice, dated March 4, 2004, a Hearing 
was held on March 31, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered six documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1 through 6) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered 
sixteen documentary exhibits (Applicant Exhibits A through P) and offered his own testimony. The transcript (TR) was received on April 19, 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Foreign Influence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive. The SOR contains three allegations, 1.a., through </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c.,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under Guideline B, one allegation under Guideline J, 
and two allegations, 3.a. and 3.b., under Guideline E. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, under Guidelines B and J .His responses under Guideline E 
are not clear admissions or denials </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as  findings of fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testimony of 
Applicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 49 years old. He is employed as a Flight Test Engineer by a United States defense contractor. The company wants him to have a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in South Vietnam. He came to the United States in 1975, and became a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">naturalized </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">United States citizen in 1982. He received a bachelors 
degrees from a United States university. Applicant is married. He and his wife  have three children, ages 20, 21, and 25. His wife and children are United States 
citizens.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a sister, who is a  citizen of and resides in Vietnam. His sister does not belong to, or participate in, any government agency of Vietnam. She is 
planning to emigrate to the United States. He sends her approximately $400 or $500 a year. Applicant also  has two brothers, who live in the United States. One 
is a citizen of the United States, and the other is still a citizen of Vietnam.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> also has an aunt, uncle, niece and nephew in Vietnam, to whom he sends approximately $100 or $200 each, three or four times a year (Tr at 36 -39).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant traveled to Vietnam on  in 1998 to visit his sister and to show his children the differences between Vietnam and the United States.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Neither Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
nor his wife has any inheritance or financial interest in Vietnam (Tr at 42). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 Guideline J (Criminal  Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 13, 1999, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was arrested and charged with two counts of Assault in the fourth degree. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The arrest was based on Applicant committing 
battery on both of his children. During the hearing, Applicant attempted to minimize the seriousness of the violence that he committed against his children (Tr 
at 45-55). However, the police report, based on an investigation of this episode, has statements from both of Applicant's children, regarding serious physical 
abuse that he committed, including the punching and kicking of his son and the slapping of his daughter. Applicant's wife also gave a statement in which she 
stated that there had been family abuse to all family members, committed by Applicant (Exhibit 3). Ultimately, Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> plead guilty, was fined $300, and was 
ordered to attend an appropriate domestic violence parenting counseling program. He attended eight sessions with a counselor, who identified himself as a 
"mental health specialist"</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Exhibit 4)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 3 Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he furnished untruthful information to the Government.  Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
completed a signed, sworn Security Clearance Application (SCA) on October 2, 2001. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 23.f. of the SCA asked if, in the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">last seven years Applicant had 
been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses.  Applicant failed to disclose the arrest and conviction that occurred in November 1999, and that is 
listed in paragraph 2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government also alleges that Applicant furnished untruthful information to the Government on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 21. of the SCA, which asked if, in the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">last seven 
years, Applicant had consulted with a mental health professional</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered "No", and failed to list his treatment by the health care  specialist, which 
was ordered by the Court as a result of his arrest. He testified that he did not read the question carefully, but he had no legitimate explanation for his failure to 
identify his treatment (Tr at 66).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> considered</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, etc. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM></EM>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department of the Navy v. Egan</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to Guidelines B, J, and E:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, 
influence or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established a 
reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a number of family members</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> who are citizens of and 
reside in</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Vietnam, not only his sister but his uncle, aunt and niece, to whom he regularly contributes money. The Vietnam citizenship and residency of 
Applicant's family create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially 
vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in 
rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a 
security clearance for him. He failed to do so. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The evidence of existence of Applicant's family, who are citizens of and reside in South Vietnam comes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1, 
"immediate family members, or persons to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, who are citizens of, or resident in, a foreign country."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence,  I have determined that his family in Vietnam does constitute an unacceptable security 
risk, and no Mitigating Condition (MC) applies. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding Guideline J, the Government has established Applicant's criminal conduct. Applicant's physical altercation with his children and his wife in 1999 
was extremely serious and severe. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant's criminal conduct falls within Criminal Conduct DC  E2.A10.1.2.1. and <EM></EM>DC E2.A10.1.2.2.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, because the violence 
perpetrated on Applicant's family by him involved serious criminal conduct, for which he pled guilty. Based on the egregious conduct involved, I cannot 
conclude that any MC applies.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant intentionally provided false material information to the Government in response to two 
questions on the SCA that he executed in October 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to our nation's secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies 
material facts on a security clearance application, it is extremely difficult to conclude that he nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty necessary for an 
individual given a clearance. In this case, there has been no reasonable explanation for Applicant's failure to list his arrest and treatment. I conclude that 
Applicant's falsifications of his SCA were knowingly and willingly committed.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.3.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> because </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> deliberately provided false and  misleading information in 
his SCA.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> No MC applies in this paragraph. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's conduct, considered as a whole, including his criminal conduct, and the misinformation that he 
provided to the Government, exhibits questionable judgement, unreliability, and a lack of candor. I resolve </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 3 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E against Applicant</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">         </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that Applicant has not overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
