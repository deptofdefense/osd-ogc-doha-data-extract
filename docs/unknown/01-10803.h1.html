<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant, an electronics technician for a defense contractor, who omitted debt arrangements with the IRS to pay old tax debts for tax years 1996 and 1998, and 
a delinquent medical debt, out of concern disclosure might jeopardize his security clearance, voluntarily disclosed his debts without prodding in an initial DSS 
interview six months later, in time to satisfy both the good faith and promptness prongs of the mitigating conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines.  Clearance 
is granted.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 7, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), 
dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on April 11, 2002, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on May 13, 2002, and was 
scheduled for hearing.  A hearing was convened on June 4, 2002, to consider whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, 
deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on five witnesses (including 
herself) and three exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on June 12, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant, an electronics technician for a defense contractor, seeks a secret-level security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is alleged to have falsified his security clearance application of December 1999 out of embarrassment and fear of losing his security clearance.  
Allegedly, he omitted three delinquent debts, when responding in the negative to question 28: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">tax debts with the IRS arising out of his filed tax returns for tax 
years 1996 and 1998, for which Applicant had arranged payment plans in force with the Service, and a delinquent medical debt of $2,150.00 for which he was 
making payments pursuant to an assigned collection agency.  Applicant's omissions are also alleged to constitute pattern criminal conduct, in violation of 18 
U.S.C. Sec. 1001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant denied any deliberate falsification of his SF-86, attributing his tax and medical debt omissions to good faith failure to 
check on the status of his debts and embarrassment and concern over jeopardizing his security clearance.  Applicant denied any pattern criminal activity and 
claimed his covered omissions were isolated and unlikely to recur.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When completing his SF-86 in December 1999, Applicant answered <STRONG>no</STRONG> to both parts of question 28, which inquired about whether or not he had any 
delinquencies in excess of 180 and 90 days, respectively.  At the time, he had payment plans in effect with both the IRS covering delinquent tax debts of 
$1,006.16 and $1,373.09, for the respective tax years of 1996 and 1998, and a delinquent medical debt in the amount of $2,150.50.  But because of claimed 
embarrassment and concern over jeopardizing  his security clearance, he made no follow-up effort to determine any of the details of his tax and medical debts.  
Inferentially, he was sufficiently acquainted with these debt delinquencies to know whether the debts were covered by question 28 of his SF-86.  Failure to list 
these debts was the result of embarrassment and fear of losing his security clearance, and not because of uncertainty over whether  the omitted debts were 
covered or not.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was interviewed by Agent A of the DSS in early June 2000, and before he could be confronted with any information about his IRS and medical debts, 
he alerted the agent of these debts.  Several weeks later, Agent A returned to interview Applicant a second time (<EM>i.e., </EM>in July 2000) and elicited more details 
about his payment plans with his IRS and medical creditors.  She returned to interview Applicant a third time several months later after obtaining a copy of his 
credit report (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2).  Called by Applicant to testify, Agent A opined that she was impressed that Applicant was forthcoming about his debts in both 
interviews and voluntarily disclosed his federal tax and medical debt delinquencies without any confronting from her (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 102-06, 128-29).  Agent A 
was impressed that Applicant made no tangible attempt to mask his  tax and medical debts.  Based on her investigation, she was impressed, too, that Applicant 
was not lacking in the level of honesty necessary for holding a security clearance (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 113-15).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Agent A's impressions about Applicant's overall honesty draw corroborating support not only by his unprompted disclosures when initially interviewed, but by 
his following through on his repayment plans with both the IRS and his medical creditor.  Each of these debts reflect considerable pay down (<EM>see</EM> exs. A through 
D).   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is highly regarded by his supervisors and colleagues as someone who is possessed of good character who can be relied on and entrusted with sensitive 
materials and assignments.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list "binding" policy considerations to be made by Judges in the decision making process covering 
DOHA cases. The term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the Judge to consider all of the "conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security 
clearance should</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the Judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In 
addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 
E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in  reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC  2  The deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security 
clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 5  A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, <EM>including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency.</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating conditions:</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3 The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 5 The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concern: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 2  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions</STRONG>:  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 2 The crime was an isolated incident.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 6 There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By dint of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance 
and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from 
the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a nexus to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of nexus, however, does not require the 
Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of accessible risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for 
the purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant comes to these proceedings with raised security-significant omissions in the security clearance application he completed in December 1999.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  In his December 1999 SF-86, Applicant omitted his debt deficiencies with the IRS, along with deficient medical debt.   His assigned reasons for his omissions 
(embarrassment and fear of losing his security clearance) are neither absolving nor extenuating of imputed knowing and wilful omission of material information 
on an executed security form known to be developed for DoD use in evaluating Applicant's background to assess his clearance eligibility.  Applicant's covered 
SF-86 omissions reveal deliberate falsification.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When first interviewed by a DSS agent some four months later, Applicant disclosed his tax and medical debts and the respective payment plans under which he 
was paying off these debts.  He is corroborated by the DSS agent who interviewed him that he voluntarily disclosed these debts when initially asked without 
being first confronted.  While Agent A's favorable impressions of Applicant's good faith candor about his corrections of his previous omissions are not 
dispositive of Applicant's good faith, they are certainly entitled to considerable weight.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 00-0033 (August 2, 2002).  Agent A's favorable 
credibility impressions are buttressed by Applicant's own favorable credibility showing in his hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's favorable credibility assessment is further reinforced by the positive professional impressions he has engendered with his interfacing government 
managers, none of whom were aware of the specific allegations covered in the SOR.  Mitigation is fully available to Applicant under the facts determined in 
this record.  He may take protective sanctuary in both MC 3 (prompt, good-faith correction of the falsification)and MC 5 (individual has taken positive steps to 
significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress).  Overall, Applicant's favorable credibility impressions enable him to 
mitigate his omissions with convincing evidence of his correcting his omissions in a prompt and good faith manner when interviewed by Agent A four months 
later.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 00-0033, <EM>supra.</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> of the evidence produced in this record and the available guidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E.2.2 factors), favorable 
conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paras. 1.a through 1.b of Guideline E. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because none of Applicant's covered omissions were isolated, never pursued to conviction, and are otherwise supported by credible evidence of mitigating 
corrections, these offenses are mitigated under the criminal conduct guidelines as well.   On the strength of the evidence presented, Applicant may claim the full 
mitigation benefits of MC 2 (isolated) and MC 6 (clear evidence of successful rehabilitation).  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraph 2.a 
of Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E.2.2 of the 
Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS and the FACTORS and CONDITIONS listed above, this 
Administrative Judge makes the following separate FORMAL FINDINGS with respect to Appellant's eligibility for a security clearance. </SPAN></P>
