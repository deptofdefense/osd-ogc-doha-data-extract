<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns were raised by a 29-year-old Vietnam-born naturalized U.S. citizen Applicant with an aunt (a housewife) and uncle (a retired doctor, teacher, 
and pedicab driver) who remain citizens and residents of Vietnam, neither of whom is an agent of Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRVN) or in a position to be 
exploited by that government.  Applicant's husband, father (who spent years in a re-indoctrination and re-education camp), stepmother, and half-siblings are

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 17, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn written statement, dated December 2, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing.  The case was 
assigned to, and received by, me on February 20, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued that same day, and the hearing was held before me via video-teleconference on March 10, 2004.  During the hearing, one joint exhibit (a stipulation), three government exhibits, 10 Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of 
one Applicant witness (the Applicant), were received.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 22, 2004.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the proceeding, under Rule 201(b)(2), Federal Rules of Evidence, Department Counsel requested that official notice be taken of certain adjudicative 
facts as set forth in a document furnished for consideration.  There being no objection by Applicant, official notice was taken of the U.S. Department of State, 
Bureau of Consular Affairs, <EM>Consular Information Sheet: Vietnam</EM>, dated January 28, 2004, consisting of nine pages.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted all of the factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence under Guideline B (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.).  Those admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a SECRET security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">She was born in 1974 in what was then the Republic of Vietnam (RVN).<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant resided with her parents for a short period and then with her mother and 
paternal grandparents and attended school in the successor Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRVN).<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  During the Vietnamese Conflict, Applicant's father 
served as an officer with the Army of RVN (ARVN).<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Upon the collapse of RVN in 1975, he was sent to a re-indoctrination and re-education camp, referred 
to by Applicant as a concentration camp, where he remained for about seven years.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Her relocation to her grandparent's home coincided with the family home 
being taken and her father being taken into custody.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  During her father's incarceration, Applicant and other members of the family visited him in the camp 
about one time each year after taking a lengthy boat trip to the location of the camp.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  When her father was eventually released in about 1982, her parents 
divorced.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  She continued to reside with her father and paternal grandmother (her grandfather had passed away in about 1984) for the next 10 years.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1992, when she was 17 years old, her father and other members of his new family were sponsored by his half-brother, a former ARVN officer who had 
managed to escape the country in 1975 when the RVN government fell to the Communists, as well as under the sponsorship of a humanitarian operation, and 
they immigrated to the United States to seek a better life.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After attending a local U.S. college during 1994-97, and obtaining a general education diploma, Applicant subsequently attended a state university during 1997-2001, and was awarded a B.S. degree in computer science.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  In May 2000, upon completing her degree requirements but before receiving her degree, and to 
fulfil a promise to her grandmother, Applicant returned to SRVN to visit her.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  She remained in SRVN for five weeks and also visited with her now-retired 
paternal aunt (who is 69 years old) and her now-retired paternal uncle (who is 63 years old).<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  The aunt has always been a housewife.  The uncle is a France-trained medical doctor who became a school teacher, but when the Communists took over, he was no longer permitted to teach school, and he became a pedicab 
"cyclo-driver" until his eventual retirement.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  She is not close to them and rarely communicated with them in the past.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant usually sent her grandmother about $600.00 each Lunar New Year, and continued that practice until her grandmother passed away in August 2003.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  
She also used to call her grandmother during that holiday season.  Upon her grandmother's passing in August 2003, Applicant returned to SRVN to attend the 
funeral.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  She also visited with a childhood friend who is an accountant for a foreign company.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  Applicant and the friend used to exchange e-mails as 
frequently as each month, but upon her friend's marriage, they no longer do so.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Her father hates the Communists and blames them for causing the family to lose their home and for sending him to the re-indoctrination and re-education camp.  
His hatred for them is so intense that he has vowed to never return to SRVN, and that vow caused him to refuse to attend his mother's funeral.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The current citizenship and residency status of Applicant's immediate family is as follows: her father is a naturalized U.S. citizen residing in the U.S.;<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> her 
mother is a citizen of SRVN who has applied for U.S. citizenship permanently residing in the U.S. for the past six years;<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> her husband, whom she married in 
June 2002,<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> is a naturalized U.S. citizen residing in the U.S.;<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> her stepmother is a naturalized U.S. citizen residing in the U.S.;<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> two of her three half-siblings are naturalized U.S. citizens residing in the U.S.;<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> the other half-sibling is a native-born U.S. citizen residing in the U.S.;<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> and her aunt and uncle are 
citizens of SRVN residing in SRVN.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant renounced her Vietnamese citizenship when she became a naturalized citizen of the United States in September 1999, and pledged her loyalty to 
protect and defend the interests of the U.S.  Applicant is not a dual citizen and considers herself to be a citizen of only the U.S.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  The government has offered 
no evidence to rebut Applicant's contention, and I accept it as fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No member of Applicant's immediate family is an employee of any SRVN governmental agency or department or affiliated with any intelligence organization 
or with the Communist Party.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  During her two visits to SRVN, Applicant was not approached by anyone seeking information about her activities in the U.S.  
She has vowed to report any such contacts if they occur.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  Neither her relatives nor her friends in SRVN are aware of what she does in the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant does not have any foreign investments or financial interests in SRVN,<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> but does own a rather expensive residence in the U.S.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  She does not send 
money or presents to anyone, including family or friends, residing in SRVN.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been employed by the same government contractor since June 2001 where she serves as a software engineer.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>  Her supervisors and colleagues 
strongly support her application and characterize her performance and character in glowing terms.<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government of RVN collapsed in 1975, coinciding with the establishment of the Communist SRVN.  Full diplomatic relations were established between 
the U.S. and SRVN in 1995, and, in 2001, a bilateral trade agreement between the two countries finally commenced.  Under that agreement, <EM>temporary</EM>--later 
modified to <EM>conditional</EM>--normal trade relations (formerly known as most-favored nation status) were extended by the U.S.  SRVN has also given the U.S. 
modest support in the war against terrorism.  While SRVN has a Communist totalitarian government that seemingly encourages technology transfers from the 
Vietnamese expatriate intellectuals abroad, the Department Counsel has offered no evidence to indicate SRVN conducts intelligence operations or economic 
espionage against the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E.2.2., Enclosure 2, 
of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>GUIDELINE B - FOREIGN INFLUENCE:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other 
persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  
These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of 
other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable 
to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in 
the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the protection of the national security is the paramount determinant, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest."  For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded that both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences that are grounded on 
mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government 
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient 
to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
the applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that the government must 
be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to 
the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness testimony, demeanor, and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal 
precepts and factors, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline B, the government has established its case.  Applicant has been portrayed as a person who is a potential security risk because 
members of her immediate family or persons to whom she is bound by affection, influence, or obligation--in this instance, her paternal aunt and paternal uncle, 
are citizens and residents of SRVN and her mother is a citizen of SRVN--are either not citizens or residents of the United States or may be subject to duress.  
These situations raise the potential for vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure, and the exercise of foreign influence that could result in the 
compromise of classified information.  However, the mere possession of family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying 
under Guideline B:<A HREF="02-14245.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The language of [Guideline] B (Foreign Influence) in the Adjudicative Guidelines makes clear that the possession of such family ties <EM>may</EM> pose a security risk.  
Whether an applicant's family ties in a foreign country pose a security risk depends on a common sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of 
those family ties.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0419 (April 30, 1999) at p. 5.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The citizenship status of Applicant's aunt, uncle, and mother, when considered in light of the nature of the government in SRVN--a Communist totalitarian 
country that is no longer involved in open military hostilities with the United States, and whose interests are not necessarily inimical to the United States, and 
currently is engaged in normal trade relations with the U.S.--facilitates an analysis involving the adjudicative guidelines and the various applicable conditions 
set forth therein.  Applicant's husband, father, stepmother, and three half-siblings are already either native-born or naturalized U.S. citizens, and only the 
continuing SRVN citizenship of her mother and the citizenship and residency of her aunt and uncle raise the issue of potential foreign influence.  In this regard, 
see Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (<EM>an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of 
affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, also applicable, in this instance, is Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. (<EM>a determination that the immediate family 
member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power in a position to 
be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States</EM>).  After an 
examination of the evidence, I determine that Applicant's mother, aunt, and uncle, considering their citizenship and residency status, do not constitute an 
unacceptable security risk.  Her mother has resided in the U.S. for a substantial period and, but for difficulty in learning English, would have applied for U.S. 
citizenship at an earlier date.  Nevertheless, she has now done so.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, Applicant's infrequent, and apparently casual, personal relationship with her 69-year-old aunt (a housewife to a pedicab "cyclo-driver") and 63-year-old uncle (a retired teacher and pedicab "cyclo driver"), as well as her more recent relationship with her childhood friend, has no security significance, and 
raises FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3. (<EM>contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent</EM>).  Her relationship with her aunt and uncle consisted 
substantially of infrequent holiday greetings and casual meetings when she visited her grandmother and later at her grandmother's funeral.  She does not send 
gifts or money to them.  While the e-mails between Applicant and her childhood friend were previously more frequent, their relationship has changed following 
the friend's marriage, and Applicant has seemingly withdrawn from such frequent contact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because Applicant's father served honorably alongside U.S. military forces during the Vietnam Conflict, he lost his home and was later forced to undergo 
postwar re-indoctrination and re-education for seven years.  The family is not Communist-to the contrary, they apparently hate the Communists-and with the 
rapidly improving relations between the two countries, there is no indication they are targets of any intelligence gathering.  Also, Applicant's husband, father, 
stepmother, and half-siblings, are all U.S. citizens residing in the U.S.  Thus, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, 
successfully mitigated and overcome the government's case with respect to Guideline B.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.d. of the SOR are concluded in 
favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
