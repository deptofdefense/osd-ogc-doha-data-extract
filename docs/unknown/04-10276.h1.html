<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 9, 2003, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).<A HREF="04-10276.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  On August 15, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  The SOR detailed reasons 
under Guideline C (foreign preference) and Guideline B (foreign influence) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn, written statement, dated October 5, 2005, but notarized October 4, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.  Department Counsel indicated the government 
was ready to proceed on November 10, 2005, and on the following day, the case was assigned to another Administrative Judge.  It was reassigned to me on March 7, 2006.  A notice of hearing was 
issued that same day, scheduling the hearing for March 30, 2006.  The hearing was held as scheduled.  During the hearing, five Government exhibits, two Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of six 
Applicant witnesses, including Applicant, were received.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 10, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel requested Official Notice be taken of the contents of the following documents: Memorandum from the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control, Communications, and 
Intelligence (ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP>I), <EM>Guidance to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of the Foreign Preference Adjudicative Guideline</EM>, dated August 16, 2000; and U.S. 
Department of State, Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, <EM>Background Note: Switzerland</EM>, dated July 2005.  Applicant requested Official Notice be taken of the contents of the following document: 
emorandum from Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, <EM>Adjudicative Guidelines</EM>, dated December 29, 2005, along with the referenced attachment. Pursuant to Rule 201, <EM>Federal 
Rules of Evidence </EM>(F.R.E.), I took Official Notice as requested, without any objection by either party.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant argued that the newly revised Adjudicative Guidelines approved by the President  in December 2005, identified above, and forwarded to the Director, Information Security Oversight Office 
(ISOO), with directions for "immediate implementation," should be in effect for this matter. I indicated that I had been previously directed by the Director, DOHA, that until such time as 
implementation guidance was issued to DOHA from higher authority, the current or "old" guidelines, as opposed to the "new" guidelines, would continue to apply.  Accordingly, I declined to apply the 
new guidelines.<A HREF="04-10276.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The argument was preserved for possible appeal.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the conclusion of Applicant's case, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to the testimony.  More specifically, he moved to delete the contents of subparagraph 1.c. of the SOR 
and substitute therefor the following language: "You maintained your citizenship with Switzerland because of your inheritance."<A HREF="04-10276.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant offered no objection to the motion and it was granted.<A HREF="04-10276.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations pertaining to foreign preference under Guideline C (subparagraphs 1.a. through c.) and all of the factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence under 
Guideline B (subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c.).  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 62-year-old<A HREF="04-10276.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> employee of a defense contractor.  He is seeking to retain a SECRET security clearance.  He previously held a CONFIDENTIAL clearance from about 1986-87 to about 
1991, and then a SECRET clearance since about 1991.<A HREF="04-10276.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  He has been employed by the same government contractor since September 1986, and currently serves as the Director of Advanced Programs.<A HREF="04-10276.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>

Swiss militia or Army Reserve.<A HREF="04-10276.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  Complying with Swiss law, Applicant served as a first lieutenant in the Swiss militia (the National Guard) from February 1963 until April 1975.<A HREF="04-10276.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  He no longer has

interviews with the U.S. government investigators, they sensed the government really wanted them to divest themselves of the property and they felt pressured to do so.<A HREF="04-10276.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A>  Had they retained the real 
estate, they believe they would have realized the full potential value of their property as both properties were still appreciating in value at the time of the respective sales.<A HREF="04-10276.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A>  However, because of the

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his wife retained their dual citizenship with Switzerland because of the Swiss laws dealing with real property ownership.  Since only Swiss citizens may own real property in 
Switzerland,<A HREF="04-10276.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A> it was financially and fiscally advisable to retain their Swiss citizenship until such time as the properties could be sold.  To do otherwise would have exposed them to substantial financial 
loss, something he would like to avoid.<A HREF="04-10276.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A>  Now that the properties have been sold, he is seriously considering renouncing his Swiss citizenship.<A HREF="04-10276.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's allegiance and loyalty towards the U.S. is "unswerving."  He made his choice of loyalty to the U.S. over Switzerland because his life is here.  He has no intention of returning to live in

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:<A HREF="04-10276.h1.html#N_77_"><SUP> (77)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>GUIDELINE B - FOREIGN INFLUENCE: </STRONG> A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>GUIDELINE C - FOREIGN PREFERENCE: </STRONG> When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide 
information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed in the 
Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 16, 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD/C<SUP>3</SUP>I) issued a passport policy "clarification" pertaining to Adjudicative Guideline 
C--foreign preference.  It is unclear if a photocopy of the memorandum was ever furnished to Applicant.  The memorandum states, in pertinent part:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify the application of Guideline C to cases involving an applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport.  The guideline specifically provides that 
"possession and/or use of a foreign passport" may be a disqualifying condition.  It contains no mitigating factor related to the applicant's personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the 
identity of the foreign country.  The only applicable mitigating factor addresses the official approval of the United States Government for the possession or use.  The security concerns underlying this 
guideline are that the possession and use of a foreign passport in preference to a U.S. passport raises doubt as to whether the person's allegiance to the United States is paramount and it could also 
facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by the United States.  <STRONG><EM>Therefore, consistent application of the guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the 
foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government. </EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Modification of the Guideline is not required.  (Emphasis supplied)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security" or "clearly consistent with the national interest."<A HREF="04-10276.h1.html#N_78_"><SUP> (78)</SUP></A> For the purposes herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded all of the standards 
are the same.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
that are grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which raises a security concern under the Directive that it is not clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present 
evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty hours 
and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial 
security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many 
characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or 
implied decision as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I 
conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted above, the entire process involves a crucial aspect of the entire analysis and synthesis of the facts-a conscientious scrutiny of the variables known as the "whole person concept." In this 
instance we are concerned with two different issues, one involving Applicant's actions pertaining to matters which might indicate a foreign preference, and another involving primarily the status of his 
and his wife's financial interests in Switzerland and potential foreign influence generated by those financial interests.  Applicant is a person whose drive and enthusiasm to work hard and 
excel--characteristics which we used to hold dear in the U.S.--motivated him to obtain extensive education, work hard, invest, and seek opportunity in the U.S.  He is to be lauded for his numerous 
successes.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, the government has chosen to question his efforts because of several issues which it considers to be negative influences on his security clearance eligibility and suitability.  He exercised dual 
citizenship based on his birth in Switzerland and his naturalization as a U.S. citizen; as required by law, he served in the Swiss militia; he inherited foreign real estate, as did his wife; they invested in 
foreign stocks and bonds; realized a return on their investments; maintained their Swiss financial interests in a Swiss bank; and he was initially reluctant to relinquish his Swiss citizenship to protect his 
inheritance.  Although not specifically alleged in the SOR, the government also indicated an interest and concern that he had used a foreign passport as a convenience; and was reluctant to remove his 
foreign financial interests from Swiss banks to U.S. banks.  Thus, Applicant's allegiance to the U.S. has been questioned, and an allegation has been made that he prefers Switzerland over the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline C plainly states an individual may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the U.S. when that individual acts in such a way as to indicate a 
preference for a foreign country over the U.S.  The government has presented evidence under Guideline C which it believes raises that vaguely-defined situation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A review of the evidence reveals his allegiance and loyalty to the U.S. are resolute, and supported by significant indicia of same.  Applicant has: surrendered his expired Swiss passport after having used 
it on several occasions for convenience, but not using it after 1995; maintained a family residence in the U.S.; made substantial investments in the U.S.; had two children born in the U.S.; sold the Swiss 
real estate his father had left him; been employed in the U.S. by the same company since 1986; and declared allegiance to the U.S.  Moreover, as stated above by a coworker, he is more American than 
many American-born Americans.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's actions in serving in the armed forces of Switzerland raises Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) E2.A3.1.2.3. (<EM>military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign 
country</EM>).  However, as previously noted, Applicant was merely fulfilling his mandatory military service obligation before becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen.  Thus, the significance of his membership 
in the Swiss militia or Army Reserve is minimized and overcome by Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition (FP MC) E2.A3.1.3.2. (<EM>indicators of possible foreign preference (e.g., foreign military 
service) occurred before obtaining United States citizenship</EM>).  Those facts alone should have been sufficient to either avoid placing the allegation in the SOR or once the allegation was made, faced with 
the evidence, the government should have withdrawn it at or before the hearing.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Possession of a foreign passport cannot be considered merely in isolation, but should be analyzed in light of all the facts and circumstances, "with the adjudicator needing to consider whether the facts 
and circumstances of possession reasonably indicate the applicant is demonstrating a foreign preference within the meaning of [Guideline] C."<A HREF="04-10276.h1.html#N_79_"><SUP> (79)</SUP></A>  The ASD/C<SUP>3 </SUP>I memo appears to be conclusive in this 
regard, negating any consideration of the facts and circumstances.  Thus, the remaining issues are whether the following actions by Applicant were indicative of a preference for Switzerland over the 
U.S.: (1) keeping and using his Swiss passport as a convenience until 1995, and then retaining the expired passport until he surrendered it in March 2006--issues which were not alleged in the SOR; and 
(2) maintaining his Swiss citizenship to protect his inheritance--an issue which was alleged in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's actions in retaining and using the Swiss passport after he became a naturalized U.S. citizen were exercises by him of his Swiss citizenship and fall within FP DC E2.A3.1.2.1. (<EM>the exercise 
of dual citizenship</EM>) and FP DC E2.A3.1.2.2. (<EM>possession and/or use of a foreign passport</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's dual citizenship is based solely on his birth in Switzerland to Swiss parents. Thus, Applicant benefits from FP MC E2.A3.1.3.1. (<EM>dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or 
birth in a foreign country</EM>).  And now that the real estate which was his inheritance has been sold, he has indicated a willingness to consider the actual renunciation of his Swiss citizenship. That comes 
within FP MC E2.A3.1.3.4. (<EM>individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship</EM>).  The ASD/C<SUP>3 </SUP>I memo states there are no mitigating factors "related to an applicant's personal 
convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country," a phrase which I construe to relate to the use of a foreign passport.  In this instance, Applicant has used that 
passport until 1995, but not thereafter.  Furthermore, the memo states "consistent application of the guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign 
passport. . . ."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon being advised of the significance of possessing a foreign passport, Applicant immediately surrendered the expired Swiss passport to Swiss authorities and indicated no desire to ever have it 
renewed.  Applicant's actions have complied with the surrender provisions of the ASD/C<SUP>3 </SUP>I memo.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have also examined the various allegations under the spotlight of those factors identified as part of the "whole person concept."  The allegations are simply that Applicant is a dual citizen having been 
born in Switzerland; that prior to becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen he complied with his military service obligation; and he maintained his Swiss citizenship to protect his inheritance. As to the first 
and third allegations, the circumstances and motivation are clear: Applicant was Swiss-born and he maintained his dual citizenship to protect his inheritance.  To do otherwise would have placed him in 
a situation where he would lose the real estate left to him by his father and caused him substantial financial loss.  Now that the property has been sold, and he is contemplating renouncing his Swiss 
citizenship, the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, to the extent there ever was any generated by the Swiss government, have been minimized and are not likely to recur.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has clearly stated his position regarding his relationship with the U.S. and his country preference.  His family is here and they are all U.S. citizens.  His home and job are here.  His allegiance 
and loyalty towards the U.S. is "unswerving."  I have read his statements and listened to his testimony, and I believe him.  I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, 
successfully mitigated and overcome the government's case with respect to Guideline C.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.c. of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B plainly states a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or 
obligation are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress.  Additionally, financial interests in other countries are relevant if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure.  The government has presented evidence under Guideline B which it believes raises those situations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been portrayed as a person who is a potential security risk because his spouse inherited an apartment house in Switzerland; he inherited some Swiss real estate from his father; and he and 
his spouse maintain a bank account in Switzerland.  This situation purportedly raises the potential for vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure, and the exercise of foreign influence that could 
result in the compromise of classified information.  In support of its contentions, the government has cited the above facts and argued that maintaining financial assets in a Swiss bank should be 
considered clear vulnerability to the whims of the Swiss government.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This is a rather unusual situation because this case does not involve the possibility of Applicant's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure arising from relationships with family members in a 
foreign country.  The purported vulnerability is derived solely from the financial holdings he and his wife have in Switzerland.  Based on the evidence, I conclude the security concerns manifested by the 
government, in this instance, are largely unfounded.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted above, Switzerland is politically stable, and its economy is among the world's most advanced and prosperous.  It has a highly developed judiciary.  It subscribes to most of the ideals with 
which the U.S. is identified.  More important is the moral obligation Switzerland takes to contribute to world peace and prosperity. Also, there is no evidence that Switzerland conducts intelligence 
operations or economic espionage against the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is little merit to the government's concerns regarding the need for heightened awareness regarding Applicant's potential vulnerability to threats from Switzerland and the presence of Applicant's 
and his wife's financial assets in Swiss banks.  Specifically, I reject the government's position that such heightened concern is justifiable simply because those assets are in Swiss banks without any 
other specific indication of the nature of the concern.  In sum, the government has argued that having foreign investments is both a foreign preference and a foreign influence suggesting there is a greater 
vulnerability to Applicant.<A HREF="04-10276.h1.html#N_80_"><SUP> (80)</SUP></A>  Upon considering the evidence, I find the government's position is unfounded and unreasonable.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Nevertheless, it is necessary to consider Applicant's potential vulnerability to exploitation through his financial interests overseas.  As noted above, Applicant has substantial financial holdings.  As of 
arch 2006, the family assets worldwide totaled about $16,000,742.  In the U.S., he has retirement plans and pensions worth approximately $1.4 million dollars.  He also owns a residence worth about 
$1,500,000, and has about $3,000,000 in U.S. banks.  Applicant's annual salary is over $140,000.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The remaining family assets, including stocks in Swiss companies, bonds, and the proceeds from the sale of the Swiss real estate holdings, are in Switzerland.  All the financial interests in Switzerland 
are in Swiss bank accounts where privacy is paramount.  Applicant intends to move all those financial assets currently in Swiss banks to the U.S. as soon as the exchange rate improves because to do so 
at this time would cost Applicant a loss of 15 per cent of the overall value of his holdings.  That would equate to a loss of about $1,000,000 or more.  From the above facts, the government has pursued 
Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.8. (<EM>a substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign-owned or -operated business that could make the individual vulnerable 
to foreign influence</EM>).  It is clear that on its face, Applicant's and his wife's foreign holdings are substantial.  It is equally clear that these facts may not fall within FI MC E2.A2.1.3.5. (<EM>foreign financial 
interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">One factor which must be considered is "the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress."  In that regard, it is important to consider the character of the foreign power in question, including 
the government and entities controlled by the government, within the relevant foreign country.  It is reasonable to presume that a friendly relationship, or the existence of a democratic government, is not 
determinative, but it may make it less likely that a foreign government would attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen through threats and intimidation under its banking laws.  Moreover, if past actions, or 
inaction, can in any way be predictive of possible future actions, or inaction, the likelihood of the exercise of any threats or intimidation coming from the Swiss government or banking authorities is nil 
because Applicant has never been approached or pressured by anyone or threatened with the loss of those foreign assets.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted above, I have also examined the various allegations under the spotlight of those factors identified as part of the "whole person concept."  The allegations, now simplified, are simply that 
Applicant and his wife currently maintain a substantial amount of financial assets--about $10,000,000--in Swiss banks.  Applicant intends to move all remaining financial assets currently in Swiss 
banks to the U.S. as soon as the exchange rate improves because to do so at this time would cost Applicant a loss of 15 per cent of the overall value of his holdings.  That would equate to a loss of about 
$1,000,000 or more.  To do so would be irresponsible.  Considering the nature of this entire situation, the motivation for the conduct, and the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, to 
the extent there ever was any generated by the Swiss government, I believe there is little likelihood for vulnerability by this U.S. citizen maintaining his Swiss financial assets in a Swiss bank until such 
time as they can be transferred to U.S. banks without ever having to personally return to Switzerland.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because of Applicant's deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in and to the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.  Consequently, I find the potential 
for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress does not constitute a security risk.  Thus, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome 
the government's case with respect to Guideline B.  Accordingly, allegations 2.a. through 2.c. of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
