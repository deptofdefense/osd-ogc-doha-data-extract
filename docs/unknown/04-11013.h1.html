<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant failed to disclose her use of drugs as required in a SF 86 she submitted in 2003, and minimized her alcohol/drug involvement during background 
interviews and at her hearing. She used illegal drugs and alcohol for at least 20 years and was diagnosed as alcohol and drug dependent. Although recovering

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 21, 2005 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security 
concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). 
The SOR informed Applicant that, based on information available to the Government, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber3"></A>On September 8, 2005, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer). Applicant admitted (in certain cases with explanations) the allegations in subparagraphs 1a, 1c, 
1d, 1e, 1f, 1g, 1h, 1i, 1j, 1k, 2b, 2d, 3c, 3d, denied the allegations in subparagraphs 1b, 1l, 1m, 1n, 2a, 2c, 2e, 3a, 3b, 3e, 3f, 4a, and 4b, and requested a hearing. 
The case was assigned to me on October 6, 2005. On November 10, 2005, I convened a hearing at which the government presented 12 exhibits, marked GE 1-12, to support the SOR.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> GE 1-10 were admitted into evidence and administrative notice was taken of the information contained in GE 11 and 12 (for 
identification) without objection. Applicant testified and presented five post-hearing</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> exhibits that were admitted without objection and marked AE 1-5.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> DOHA 
received the transcript (Tr.) on November 28, 2005.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">admissions are incorporated herein as findings of facts. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following 
additional findings of facts:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 40 years old, single, and has completed approximately one year of college. In March 2002, she was hired by a defense contractor to work as a 
meeting planner/coordinator. In March 2003, Applicant was granted an interim secret clearance. As a result of concerns raised by her background investigation, 
Applicant's interim security clearance was revoked in April 2005. Because of her outstanding duty performance, her employer considers Applicant a crucial 
element to their continued success, and has supported Applicant's clearance application.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father was an alcoholic, and her step father, brother, and members of her extended family abused alcohol and/or used drugs. Applicant testified that 
as an adolescent, she was a follower, not a leader. Most of her problems arose as a result of her following bad examples, being involved with the wrong people, 
and making bad choices. She began drinking alcohol as an adolescent, using marijuana as a teenager, and using cocaine at age 20. Initially she was a social 
drinker/user, consuming alcohol, marijuana and cocaine during weekends, at parties, and during holidays. From age 20 through 35, Applicant's abuse of alcohol 
and illegal use of drugs escalated with the passage of time until she became alcohol and crack cocaine dependent. From age 30 through 35, she consumed 
alcohol and illegal drugs at least three times a week, sometimes on a daily basis. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also purchased and sold illegal drugs, and around 1992 
experimented with PCP and heroin.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1996, Applicant sought rehabilitative treatment to stop her consumption of illegal drugs and alcohol. She failed, however, to follow her treatment plan and 
was dismissed from the treatment facility. In November 2000, Applicant realized she had a serious drug and alcohol related problem and again sought help. 
After she stopped using drugs for a number of days in December 2000, Applicant successfully attended a four day detoxification program in her home state. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Not satisfied that she was cured, and afraid of a recurrence, Appellant sought additional long-term drug and alcohol rehabilitation treatment. Applicant claimed 
that to secure admission/referral into a long-term rehabilitation program she purposely lied and exaggerated her history and consumption of drugs and alcohol. 
Applicant testified that part of her exaggerations and lies, reflected on her medical records, included: that she began consuming alcohol at age four; consuming 
alcohol daily; beginning her use of marijuana at age 15; using marijuana daily; using crack cocaine daily from age 20 through 35, and using PCP and heroin.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After her four day detoxification treatment, from December 11, 2000 through January 23, 2001, Applicant successfully attended four other inpatient 
rehabilitative treatment facilities. On December 12, 2000, a psychiatrist from one of these facilities, diagnosed her with a bi-polar disorder, crack cocaine and 
alcohol dependency, and marijuana abuse.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Applicant's medical discharge records from one of these facilities, showed that From January 23 through March 22, 
2001, Applicant received additional aftercare treatment at another facility, and then continued her aftercare treatment at a live-in facility through December 
2001. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant claimed she was successful in her rehabilitation efforts and has been clean and sober, with no relapses, since December 2000. Applicant's assertions 
are corroborated, in part, by her medical records and letters from four different treatment facilities.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> These documents corroborate that, at least up to April 16, 
2001, Applicant was clean and sober. There is no evidence Applicant has been involved in any incident related to the consumption of alcohol or drugs since her 
release from rehabilitative treatment. Applicant claimed that after her release from the live-in facility she attended Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) and/or Narcotics 
Anonymous (NA) in her home state, until sometime in 2004. To corroborate her testimony, Applicant introduced her third and fourth year medallions from NA 
showing that she has remained clean and sober.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been arrested and/or charged five times. In July 1990, Applicant was arrested for larceny. In August 1990, she was arrested and charged with 
attempted possession of cocaine, a felony.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Applicant testified she was intoxicated at the time of the August 1990 incident and was arrested primarily because 
she was disorderly. The charge was later dismissed by the court. In May 1991, she was arrested and charged with uttering paper with a forged endorsement, a 
felony. The charge was dismissed after she made restitution. Applicant testified she was intoxicated at the time of the incident.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> In September 1999, she was 
charged with the unauthorized use of her step father's car. Applicant was not arrested for this offense, and the charge was dismissed. Finally, in July 2000, she 
was arrested and charged with second degree assault, disorderly conduct, and reckless endangerment. Applicant indicated she was intoxicated the night before 
and was suffering from the effects of alcohol at the time of this incident. In July 2000 these charges were dismissed.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In February 2003, Applicant submitted an Office of Personnel Management Security Clearance Application (SF 86) in which she answered "NO" to questions 
inquiring about her felony arrest record and use of illegal drugs within the preceding seven years. Applicant claimed that, because of her alcohol and drug 
involvement, she did not know she was ever charged with a felony offense. Applicant testified the first time she realized she had been charged with a felony 
offense was when she received the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding her failure to disclose her use of illegal drugs, Applicant initially testified she had no explanation for her failure to disclose her 15-year use of illegal 
drugs.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Later during her testimony, Applicant claimed, for the first time, that a corporation facility security officer (FSO) advised her to be careful with her 
answers. Applicant took that warning as a suggestion to change her answers to the SF 86 questions asking about her criminal history and drug abuse and 
omitted the information from the SF 86.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After falsifying the SF 86, Applicant continued to minimized the extent of her drug and alcohol history. In her November 2003 statement, Applicant stated she 
never purchased or sold drugs, that she never used cocaine powder, that she never used PCP or heroin, and that she used crack cocaine and marijuana only three 
or four times a year. In her August 2004 statement, Applicant admitted to purchasing and selling drugs, using marijuana since 1983, and using marijuana laced 
with cocaine and another drugs. At the hearing, Applicant admitted to using crack cocaine two to three times a week prior to her attending detoxification 
treatment, and probably using PCP and heroine. Applicant's medical/treatment records reflect the true extent of her alcohol and drug abuse. She had a 20 year 
history, from approximately age 15 to age 35, of alcohol and illegal drug use that culminated with her dependance on alcohol and crack cocaine, and marijuana 
abuse.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant presented character reference letters provided by Applicant's general manager and two friends. The general manager's letter is noteworthy. It 
indicates Applicant has been employed by his corporation since 2002. During that time, she has been characterized as a dependable and trusted employee with 
an exemplary duty performance. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified 
information. The administrative judge has to take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the 
facts and circumstances of the case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and <A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber9"></A>impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the 
Directive,<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> and the whole person concept.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or 
against an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy 
guidance governing the granting or denial of access to classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant 
adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline H (Illegal Drugs), and Guideline 
J (Criminal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> for an Applicant to either receive or 
continue to have access to classified information. The government has the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must establish a prima facie case that it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. The responsibility then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the 
Government's case. Because no one has a right to a security <A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber10"></A>clearance, the Applicant carries a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> A person who has access to 
classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a compelling 
interest to ensure each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her 
own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access to 
classified information in favor of protecting national security.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Personal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the ultimate question - whether a person's past conduct instills 
confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">An applicant's conduct is a security concern if it involves questionable 
judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such behavior could indicate that 
the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Here, the government's concern stems from Applicant's falsification of her SF 86 by </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">failing to 
disclose that she was charged with two felony offenses (larceny in 1990, and uttering paper with forged endorsement in 1991), and her illegal drug use from 
about 1996 to at least 2000. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In her answer, Applicant admitted she was arrested in 1990 and charged with shoplifting, but denied that she was charged with a felony larceny offense. She 
averred that she did not know she was ever charged with a felony offense until she received the SOR. The government failed, however, to present evidence to 
establish the controverted fact that Applicant was indeed charged with a felony larceny offense.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Concerning the May 1991 arrest and charge for uttering paper with forged endorsement, GE 9 shows Applicant was charged with a felony. Applicant admitted 
she was arrested and charged. She claimed, however, that she was intoxicated at the time of the arrest and was not aware of being charged with a felony offense 
until she received the SOR.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> I cannot discount Applicant's explanation for her actions in light of her drug/alcohol problems that arguably clouded Applicant's 
recollection of the incidents. In light of Applicant's lifestyle at the time of the offense, I conclude she was not aware she was charged with a felony offense 
when she answered SF 86 Question 21.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant deliberately failed to disclose her illegal use of cocaine, crack cocaine, and marijuana. Furthermore, she did so after being warned by one of the 
corporation's FSOs to be careful with her answers in the SF 86. Applicant elected to take the warning as a suggestion to hide her past use of illegal drugs 
instead of being truthful in her answers. Her omissions were deliberate and with the intent to mislead the government about information relevant and material to 
her suitability to hold a clearance. Based on the facts and circumstances, Disqualifying Condition (DC) 2<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> and DC 4<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> are applicable and must be considered 
here.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">I have considered all the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>, and find that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">none apply. After falsifying the SF 86, Applicant continued to minimize the 
extent of her drug and alcohol history, providing additional piecemeal information in two subsequent statements and at the hearing. In light of all the facts and 
circumstances, I conclude Applicant's falsification is relatively recent and not an isolated incident. Furthermore, the pressures that led her to falsify the SF 86, 
her desire to cover up her drug abuse/dependency, are still present in her life. As such, she is likely susceptible to influence, pressure, or coercion to cover up 
her past behavior. Accordingly, I conclude Guideline E against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control 
impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> The government established its case under Guideline 
G by showing that Applicant consumed alcohol to excess and to the point of addiction.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> She was also arrested multiple times because she exercised 
exceedingly poor judgment when drinking. Applicant's drinking was addressed through two periods of treatment. Guideline G Disqualifying Condition (DC) 
1,<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> and DC 3,<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> DC 4,<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline H (Drug Involvement). Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect 
classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information. Such conduct may also be criminal and indicative of a disregard for rules and regulations in place to protect national interests.<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> The government 
established its case under Guideline H by showing that Applicant used marijuana, cocaine, and crack cocaine, with varying frequency, to include daily, from 
1985 until around December 2000; and that Applicant purchased and sold drugs.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Further, the government established that Applicant received drug rehabilitation 
treatment at several recognized drug treatment facilities, and was diagnosed by a physician/psychiatrist as crack cocaine dependent, and a marijuana abuser. 
Guideline H DC 1,<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> DC 2,<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> DC 3,<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> and DC 4<A HREF="04-11013.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> <A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber12"></A>apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In 2001, Congress passed 10 U.S.C. 986. The statute, in its pertinent part, prohibits the Department of Defense from granting or continuing a security clearance 
for any applicant who </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to a controlled substance (as defined by the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">I find that 
the government evidence failed to establish that, at the time of the hearing, Applicant was an unlawful user, or addicted to a controlled substance. I conclude 18 
U.S.C. 986, as it relates to Guideline H, is not applicable to this case.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P>

However, considering her long 
history of substance abuse, the nature and seriousness of her dependency, the numerous rehabilitation programs that she attended between December 2000 and 
December 2001, her failure to participate in any aftercare programs since approximately February 2005, and the fact that she minimized her behavior, I find 
none of the Guideline G and Guideline H mitigating conditions apply.</SPAN></P>

own account, had been clean and sober for approximately three years. Her actions cannot be attributed to the influence of alcohol or drugs. Applicant's 
falsification is relatively recent and her conduct is aggravated by her continued minimization of her history of drug use and dependency in her two statements 
and at the hearing. Under the totality of the circumstances, I find Applicant's criminal behavior is not isolated, and that she has not demonstrated clear evidence 
of successful rehabilitation. Furthermore, the pressures that led her to falsify the SF 86, her desire to cover up her drug abuse/dependency, are still present in her 
life. Guideline J is decided against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

Applicant's request for a security clearance.</SPAN></P>
