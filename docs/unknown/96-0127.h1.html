<P>	On April 8, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January
2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be
denied or revoked. The SOR is attached. Applicant filed his Answer to the SOR on May 2, 1996.</P>

<P>	The first hearing was held on June 24, 1996.<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> The case was transferred to the undersigned
on July 5, 1996.<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> The Government and Applicant submitted documentary evidence.<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> The
Government presented 2 witnesses. Testimony was taken from Applicant and one witness. The
transcript was received on July 2, 1996. A supplemental hearing was held on February 19, 1997.
The transcript was received on February 28, 1997. </P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</U></STRONG>At the original hearing on June 24, 1996, subparagraph 2c was amended by adding the
number "4" to the clause describing alleged use of cocaine. Subparagraph 2c now reads,"You
answered "YES" and indicated that you had used marijuana 20-40 times during the approximate
period from 1979 to 1980, had used cocaine about 10 times during the period 1981 until
198[4]...." (Vol. I, Tr. 9-10).<STRONG><U></STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>In the week of July 15, 1996, Applicant was advised that the originally assigned Judge
was not expected to return for approximately 6 weeks. Applicant was advised he could have the
case reheard by another judge or he could have the case decided by the undersigned based on the
case record. On July 23, 1996, Applicant stated his preference to have the case decided by the
original judge. On October 4, 1996, and by telephone conversation in the week of October 7,
1996, Applicant was requested to furnish his decision to have the case reheard by another judge
or have the case decided on the written record. On October 16, 1997, Applicant's counsel stated
by letter his client would agree to this Administrative Judge deciding the case on the record if he
listened to the tapes of the first hearing. </P>

<P>	On October 16, 1996, Applicant provided a letter (dated October 16, 1996) from the
treatment center (Applicant's Exhibit C) regarding Applicant's updated status in the program. On
October 22, 1996, the Government filed a Motion in Opposition to the admission into evidence
of the treatment status letter.</P>

<P>	On February 7, 1997, a conference call was held with the parties. I indicated I would not
listen to the tapes of the first hearing because the transcript and not the tapes constitute the
official record. I scheduled a supplemental hearing for February 19, 1997 to allow Applicant an
opportunity to present any additional evidence he believed was relevant. I also indicated the post-hearing treatment exhibit (filed on October 16, 1997) would be ruled upon at the supplemental
hearing.</P>

<P>	At the supplemental hearing on February 19, 1997, Applicant presented a second updated
treatment report from the same treatment center.<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> The Government's Motion in Opposition to the
two updated treatment letters, was denied because of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, section 19,
which  provides that the rules of evidence should be relaxed to permit the development of a full
record.  Hence, even though the counselor's letters contain significant evidentiary defects of
hearsay and lack of foundation, the six documents were marked as Applicant's Exhibit D and
admitted in the record.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the
documents and the live testimony. The SOR alleges Criterion H (drug involvement), Criterion E
(personal conduct) and Criterion J (criminal conduct). Applicant denied subparagraph 1h and
explained he did not recall the recent use of marijuana until after he signed the statement. He
denied 1j and 1k because he did not recall his last use of marijuana until the interviews with the
Special Agent on or around October 19, 1995. He did not answer subparagraph 3a as the
subparagraph constitutes a conclusion of law. He admitted all the other allegations of the SOR.<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	Applicant is 36 years old and employed as an ---------------------- for 12 years by a defense
contractor.<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> He seeks a top secret clearance.</P>

<P>	Applicant first smoked marijuana in 1977 or 1988 and used the drug in different social
settings at different frequencies from 1977 to 1983.<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A> Sometimes, he smoked marijuana once a
week or twice a month. From 1983 to 1988, he used the drug about 20 times. Between 1988 and
January 1993, he used the drug about 10 times. He used the drug about 20 times in 1993, but
only three or four times in 1994. He smoked the drug two or three times between January 1995
and March 1995. After abstaining from the drug between March and May 1995, Applicant thinks
he used the drug on May 28, 1995. He purchased marijuana only two or three times between
1977 and 1985.</P>

<P>	Applicant smoked hashish on two occasions between 1980 and 1982.<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A> He never bought
hashish. He used cocaine in 1980 in a pipe. He used cocaine about 10 times between 1980 and
1983 or 1984.  He used LSD in 1979 but did not know it. He used 2 additional times and was
aware he was using the drug. He purchased LSD once. Applicant first used speed in 1979.
Between 1979 and 1981 and 1982, Applicant used speed about 15 times. He may have bought
the drug also. He used mushrooms in 1979 and also one or two times in 1983. Applicant may
have used PCP in 1980 but is not certain. Applicant continued using marijuana after being
granted a clearance on March 22, 1990.</P>

<P>	On July 11, 1988,<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A> Applicant falsified a supplemental questionnaire dated July 1988
(questions #1 and #2), by disclosing less marijuana, cocaine and amphetamine use than he
actually used.<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP>(10)</SUP></A> (Vol. I, Tr. 98). He failed to mention his frequency and use of PCP mushrooms
altogether. Applicant falsified questions #3 and #4 of the July 11,1988 supplemental form when
he answered "NO" to question #3 and then explained the only drug he purchased once or twice
was marijuana.<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP>(11)</SUP></A> (Vol. I, Tr. 98). </P>

<P>	On September 12, 1988,<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP>(12)</SUP></A> Applicant falsified a personal security questionnaire when he
revealed less than the full history of marijuana use.<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP>(13)</SUP></A> Applicant actually used marijuana about 20
times between 1984 and 1988. (Vol. I, Tr. 129-130; GE #6). He also did not reveal he had used
LSD, PCP, and mushrooms. In addition, Applicant  provided false information on the
questionnaire by answering "NO" to question 18b (the drug purchase and possession question).<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP>(14)</SUP></A>
Applicant answered "NO" because: (1) the drug use happened so long ago (Vol. I, Tr. 98); (2) he
did not understand the question;<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP>(15)</SUP></A> and, (3) he thought the question applied to drug dealers. (Vol.
I, Tr. 131).</P>

<P>	On January 13, 1995 (subparagraphs 2e and 2f), Applicant falsified questions 22a and
22b of his security form. In response to question 22a, he minimized his drug use. (Vol. I, Tr.
135). In response to question 20b, he indicated had never purchased any drug.<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP>(16)</SUP></A> He also provided
less than the full picture of his drug history on GE #2. (Vol. I, Tr. 137). </P>

<P>	Applicant provided a sworn statement on June 30, 1995 (subparagraph 2h) in which he
falsely stated he last used marijuana in January 1995, when his last use was really at the end of
ay 1995.<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP>(17)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	In an interview of June 20, 1995, Applicant denied ever falsifying a security form. (Vol.
I, Tr. 142).<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP>(18)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	Applicant provided false information during an interview on October 12, 1995. In the
initial interview about his drug use, Applicant provided false information when he said used
marijuana in February 1995, but denied any use or possession after that time. (Vol. I, Tr. 67). In a
later interview (during the polygraph examination), Applicant provided false information when
he said his last use of marijuana was no later than March 1995 instead of February 1995. (Vol. I,
Tr. 66-67). After the polygraph examination, Applicant stated his last use was May 28, 1995.
(Vol. I, Tr. 67).<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP>(19)</SUP></A> </P>

<P>	Applicant's performance evaluations for 1991, 1992 and 1993, signed by his supervisor,
reflect he has exceeded requirements. (Applicant's Exhibits A, B). Applicant has received a
promotion to ----------------- and has been awarded merit increases since the last hearing. (Vol. II,
Tr. 21). He is the ------------------ for the section and regularly participates in group meetings to
increase the competitiveness of the section. (Vol. II, Tr. 23). Applicant intends to forego all
future drug use because he has matured, recently married and become a father. (Vol. I, Tr. 117). </P>

<P>	Applicant's Exhibits C and D explain Applicant's participation in an outpatient treatment
program. Treatment for six months was recommended and Applicant began treatment on June
14, 1996.  As of June 20, 1996, he had completed three sessions with a negative urinalysis. On
October 16, 1996, the counselor indicated Applicant completed 24 three hour sessions and had
plans to accomplish the four months of one hour per week after care. On February 17, 1997,
Applicant completed all his after care sessions. He continued to use the 12 Step education, along
with his sponsor and home group. Applicant attended numerous Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)
meetings and continues to attend. (Vol. II, Tr. 19).<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP>(20)</SUP></A> Applicant has consumed no alcohol since
June 17, 1996,<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP>(21)</SUP></A> and believes his falsifications were primarily the result of minimization and
denial of his drug addiction. (Vol. II, Tr. 20, 27).</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	Applicant's supervisor since 1985 considers Applicant's job performance above average
with a good attendance record. (Vol. I, Tr, 74). Applicant is truthful, reliable, and sometimes,
performs supervisory duties. (Vol. I, Tr. 78-79).</P>

<P>	Applicant's credibility is negatively affected by the various explanations he provided for
furnishing false information on security forms and sworn statements.<A HREF="96-0127.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP>(22)</SUP></A> Even though Applicant
believes denial caused by his alcohol and drug addiction are at the heart of his falsehoods, the
other explanations are equally relevant to Applicant's state of mind at the times he was
confronted with official documents and had to decide whether to provide truthful or untruthful
information.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth policy factors which must be given binding
consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors must be considered in
every case according to the pertinent criterion; however, the factors are in no way <U>automatically</U>
<U>determinative</U> of the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's
reliance on his own common sense. Because each security case presents its own unique facts and
circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the entire realm of human
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. In addition, the Judge, as the trier of
fact, must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Factors most pertinent to
evaluation of the facts in this case are:</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criterion H (drug involvement)</CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P><U>Factors Against Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	1. any drug abuse.</P>

<P>	2. illegal drug possession, including...purchase....</P>

<P><U>Factors for Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	None.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criterion E (personal conduct)</CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P><U>Factors Against Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	2. deliberate omission...falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel
security questionnaire...to conduct investigations...determine security clearance eligibility or
trustworthiness....</P>

<P>	3. deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and
material matters to an investigator...in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness
determination.</P>

<P><U>Factors for Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	None.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criterion J (criminal activity)</CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P><U>Factors Against Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	1. any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged.</P>

<P>	2. a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</P>

<P><U>Factors for Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	None.</P>

<P>			<STRONG><CENTER>General Policy Factors (Whole Person Concept)</CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>Every security clearance case must also be evaluated under additional policy factors that
make up the whole person concept. Those factors (found at page 2-1 of Enclosure 2 of the
Directive) include: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances
surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or
absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; and,
(8) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	As set forth in the Directive, every personnel security determination must be a fair and
impartial overall commonsense decision based upon all available information, both favorable and
unfavorable, and must be arrived at by applying the standard that the granting (or continuance) of
a security clearance under this Directive may only be done upon a finding that to do so is clearly
consistent with the national interest. In reaching determinations under the Directive, careful
consideration must be directed to the actual as well as the potential risk involved that an
applicant may fail to properly safeguard classified information in the future. The Administrative
Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in
the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</P>

<P>	The Government must establish all the factual allegations under Criterion H (drug
involvement), Criterion E (personal conduct), Criterion J (criminal activity) which establishes
doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. While a rational connection, or
nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively
safeguard classified information, with respect to the sufficiency of proof of a rational connection,
objective or direct evidence is not required.</P>

<P>	Then, the applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,
explanation, mitigation or extenuation which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is
unlikely to repeat itself and Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The Government has established a case under Criterion H as Applicant has used seven
drugs over the years at various times and frequencies. Applicant's drug of choice was marijuana
because he used the drug from 1977 to May 28, 1995. He also purchased marijuana periodically
until 1985 and even continued to use the drug after he was granted a top secret clearance in
arch 1990. In addition, Applicant furnished false information about his marijuana and other
drug use on a number of occasions between 1988 and October 1995.</P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under Criterion E. The information sought by
the Government in the personnel security questionnaire and sworn statements was relevant and
material to the Government's investigation of Applicant's suitability for safeguarding classified
information. Applicant's explanations for falsifying the forms have been thoroughly evaluated
individually and together. Except for his explanation of alcohol or drug-related denial, and the
explanation of concern over his security clearance and/or his job, his other explanations lack any
credibility and are actually rationalizations for intentionally falsifying the security forms and
sworn statements. After analyzing all the explanations, the undeniable conclusion is Applicant,
even though he was going through different denial stages of his addictions between 1988 and
ay 1995, intentionally falsified the questionnaires and sworn statements with total denials or
partial pictures of the complete scope of his drug history.</P>

<P>	Applicant's concern about his job and clearance is not a satisfactory reason for
intentionally falsifying Government documents. An applicant must provide forthright and honest
information during all phases of the security investigation. Applicant's pattern of dishonest
conduct between 1988 and October 1995 raises significant concern about Applicant's judgment
to comply with security regulations in all places and at all times. </P>

<P>	Applicant's intentional falsifications between 1988 and October 1995 constitutes
felonious criminal conduct in violation of 18 USC 1001. The omitted information was material
because the Government was denied essential background information potentially affecting the
outcome of Applicant's application for a security clearance. </P>

<P>	 Applicant's performance evaluations, his job promotions and his participation in other
job-related activities weigh positively in Applicant's favor. The completion of therapy and after
care, and Applicant's continuing commitment to AA and the 12 Steps, provides sufficient
evidence to conclude Applicant will continue abstinence and recovery in the future. Because
Applicant's drug use was not extensive, and did not include long-term use of several kinds of
drugs or more serious drugs, i.e., cocaine, and the treatment program reports reflect he is
determined to maintain his recovery, I find for Applicant under Criterion H.</P>

<P>	But, the positive evidence of drug rehabilitation under Criterion H falls well short of
overcoming Applicant's ultimate burden of persuasion under Criterion E and J. The eleven
falsifications seriously undermine Applicant's credibility because the falsehoods occurred
repeatedly over a seven year period until October 1995 and involved the deliberate omission of
material information designed to minimize Applicant's drug history to maximize his chances of
obtaining a security clearance and/or protecting his job. </P>
