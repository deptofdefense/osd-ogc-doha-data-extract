<P>Applicant has a history of criminal conduct extending from 1986 to 1999.  This includes two felony convictions for physical altercations with police officers 
and several incidents of assault and battery.  He also has two convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol.  Applicant failed to mitigate the security 
concerns arising from his criminal conduct.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On June 13, 2002, Applicant submitted a security clearance application.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a security 
clearance for Applicant under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").  On April 5, 2004, 
DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.  The SOR alleges security concerns raised under the Directive, specifically 
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on May 5, 2004.  He elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.</P> 
<P>I received the case on October 12, 2005.  With the concurrence of Applicant and Department Counsel, I convened the hearing on November 17, 2005.  The 
government introduced Exhibits 1 through 12.  Applicant testified on his own behalf.  At the beginning of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend 
the SOR by deleting &para; 1.i in accordance with the amendment to 10 U.S. C. &sect; 986. <STRONG> </STRONG>There being no objection, I granted the motion.  DOHA received the 
transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 1, 2005. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted the factual allegations in &para;&para; 1.a through 1.h of the SOR, with explanations.  (Applicant's Answer to SOR, dated May 5, 2005.)  Those 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional 
findings of fact.</P> 
<P>Applicant was born in January 1960.  (Ex. 1 at 1.)  When he was 17 years old, he left high school and enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps, where he served from 
August 1977 to July 1979.  (<EM>Id.</EM> at 3; Tr. at 34-35.)  Applicant held a security clearance while in the Marine Corps.  (Tr. at 35.)<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant began working for his current employer, a defense contractor, in May 1980.  (Ex. 1 at 1.)  In June 1981, Applicant was married.  (<EM>Id. </EM>at 2.)  Two 
children were born of the marriage.  (<EM>Id.</EM> at 3.)</P> 
<P>In October 1986, while driving home after drinking alcohol during an evening in a club, Applicant allowed the vehicle he was driving to cross the center line 
and side-swipe another car.  (Tr. at 15; Ex. 12.)  The police responded and Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol 
(DUI) and Driving on the Wrong Side of the Road.  (Answer to SOR,<EM> supra</EM>, at 2.)  </P> 
<P>Applicant and his wife had a troubled marriage.  (Tr. at 13.)  They argued often and at times their disputes became violent.  In May 1989, Applicant's wife filed 
a complaint with authorities, who arrested Applicant for Simple Battery and Contempt of Court.  (Tr. at 20.)  The charge was later dismissed.  (Ex. 12 at 2.)  </P> 
<P>Similar problems with his wife led to an arrest for Disorderly Conduct in November 1989.  (Ex. 12 at 2.)  Applicant was found guilty and required to pay a 
$55.00 fine.  (Answer to SOR, <EM>supra</EM> at 2.)  </P> 
<P>Later that same month, Applicant was again involved in an argument with his wife at their home, and she called the police.  (Ex. 5 at 3-4.)  A witness reported 
that shots were fired, although Applicant denies this.  The police officers told Applicant to step into the yard, but he refused to leave his home.  (<EM>Id.</EM>)  As the 
police approached Applicant, he grabbed one of the officers, dragged him into the house, and scuffled with him.  A second officer entered the home to assist.  
Applicant struck and hit the police officers before he was physically subdued and placed under arrest.  Authorities charged Applicant with two counts of 
Aggravated Assault on a Police Officer, Aggravated Assault on his wife, and two counts of Obstruction of a Police Officer.  (Tr. at 22; Ex. 5 at 3.)  In April 
1990, pursuant to a plea agreement, Applicant pled guilty to two counts of Obstruction of a Police Officer.  The court sentenced him to five years confinement 
to be served on probation, a $1,000.00 fine, and 250 hours of community service.  (Ex. 5 at 1.)</P> 
<P>He was arrested again in December 1989 for Simple Battery and Contempt of Court.  (Answer to SOR, <EM>supra</EM> at 2.)  The court later dismissed the charges.  
(Ex.12 at 2.)  </P> 
<P>In August 1996, Applicant and his wife got into an argument.  His wife smashed the car windshield.  He asserted she got their pistol, but he took it from her.  
(Ex. 7 at 1.)  Applicant took the pistol and a half-pint bottle of whiskey and went out to his car.  When the police arrived, they attempted to restrain Applicant, 
but he resisted, leading to a scuffle.(Ex. 7 at 2.)  Applicant broke free of the police and ran into his house.  (<EM>Id.</EM>)  They later apprehended and handcuffed 
Applicant; he threatened to harm the arresting officers.  Authorities charged Applicant with two counts of Obstruction of Police Officers, making Terroristic 
Threats, Interference with Government Property, Possession of a Firearm by a convicted felon, Escape, Simple Battery, and creating a Public Disturbance.  (Ex. 
6 at 1.)  Applicant negotiated a plea agreement to Obstruction of Police Officers and Possession of a Firearm by a Felon; the remaining charges were not 
prosecuted.  The court sentenced Applicant to five years confinement to be served on probation, a $1,500.00 fine, and payment of court fees.  The court also 
required Applicant to submit to an alcohol/drug assessment.  (Ex. 6 at 1.)  </P> 
<P>Applicant enrolled in counseling to help with his marital problems, focusing on depression and anger management. (Tr. at 33.) He continued the counseling for 
about one year.</P> 
<P>On January 24, 1999, Applicant consumed several drinks of whiskey while watching a football game, and then drove to visit a friend.  (Tr. at 15-16.)  He saw a 
female acquaintance and stopped to pick her up.  (Tr. at 15.)  A police officer in a nearby patrol car pulled Applicant over for stopping his vehicle suddenly.  
(Tr. at 16.)  The patrolman administered a field sobriety test, then took Applicant to the police station for a Breathalyzer test.  (Tr. at 16.)  Applicant coughed 
into the machine; the officers concluded he refused to take the test.  Authorities charged applicant with DUI.</P> 
<P>In April 1999, Applicant pled guilty to the DUI charge.  (Tr. at 16.)  The court sentenced him to pay a $645.00 fine or serve six months in jail, and to perform 
community service.  He was also required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings for six months.  (Ex. 7 at 4; Tr. at 18.)  Applicant indicated he didn't learn 
anything from the program.  (Tr. at 19.) </P> 
<P>Applicant's last arrest for DUI occurred while he was still on probation for the incident in August 1996.  (Tr. at 20.)  As a result, on February 1, 1999, 
authorities revoked Applicant's probation.  He was required to spend ten days in confinement.  (Tr. at 20; Ex. 6 at 9.)  </P> 
<P>Applicant divorced his wife in September 1998.  (Ex.1 at 2.)  He was awarded custody of their children.  (Tr. at 27.)  </P> 
<P>Applicant still works for the defense contractor.  He began as a drill press operator in the fabrication shop.  (Tr. at 36.)  He then worked as a composite 
fabricator, and later as a mechanic on experimental aircraft.  (<EM>Id.</EM>)  In about April 1996, Applicant received a Secret clearance.  (Ex. 1 at 6.)  Subsequently, he 
was considered for a Special Access Program to work on a classified project; the military service involved denied his access.  (Tr. at 38; Ex. 9.)  Applicant also 
worked as a material review board investigator in the Quality Control area.  (Tr. at 37.)  In August 1999 he received a commendation for outstanding job 
performance.  (Ex. 8.)  At the time of the hearing, Applicant had successfully held a security clearance for about nine years.  (Tr. at 14.) </P> 
<P>Presently, Applicant stills consumes alcoholic beverages regularly.  Tr. at 17.)  He drinks whiskey on the average of three or four days each week.  (Tr. at 18.)  
He estimates his consumption at about one-half to one pint of whiskey each week.  (Tr. at 17-18.)  He denies drinking to the point of intoxication.  (Tr. at 18.)  </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently 
trustworthy to occupy a position &hellip; that will give that person access to such information."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">(<EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988)).  In 
Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding 
classified information within the executive branch. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this 
case is: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J, Criminal Conduct:  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  (Directive, &para; E2.2.1.)  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, 
reliable information about the person. <EM> Id.</EM>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age 
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
(<EM>Id.</EM>) <BR> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.  (Directive, &para; E3.1.14.)  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  (Directive, &para; E3.1.15.)  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance."  (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly 
consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  (Directive, &para; E2.2.2.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  (Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.)  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President has established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A10.1.2.1 of the Directive provides that "allegations or admission of criminal conduct" may be disqualifying.  Similarly, under &para; E2.A10.1.2.2 of 
the Directive, it may be disqualifying where an applicant committed "a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses."  Applicant's record includes two felony 
convictions and several misdemeanor offenses.  I find both these potentially disqualifying conditions are raised in this case.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the Directive, the security concerns arising from a history of criminal conduct may be mitigated in certain circumstances.  Under &para; E2.A10.1.3.1 of the 
Directive, it may be mitigating when "the criminal behavior was not recent."  The Directive does not define the term "recent"; the recency of an incident is 
determined by considering all the circumstances, including the applicant's age, his pattern of behavior over a period of time, and the number of years since the 
last incident relative to the entire course of conduct.  Applicant has a history of criminal charges for offenses related to alcohol abuse and violent conduct 
extending from 1986 through 1999, a period of about 13 years.  However, he has had no criminal incidents for about seven years.  Considering all the 
circumstances, I conclude Applicant's criminal conduct is not recent, and this potentially mitigating condition applies.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, &para; E2.A10.1.3.2, also provides that it may be mitigating where "the crime was an isolated incident."  As noted above, Applicant has a long history 
of crimes related to alcohol abuse and violence.  His crimes are not isolated incidents; therefore, this potentially mitigating condition does not apply. <STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A10.1.3.4 of the Directive states it may be mitigating where "the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur."  Similarly, under &para; 
E2.A10.1.3.6 of the Directive, it may be mitigating where "there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation."  Applicant's repeated arguments with his wife 
gave rise to the offenses that resulted in violence or public disturbance.  He divorced her in 1998 and has little regular contact.  I find the factors leading to 
Applicant's violent offenses are not likely to recur.  Several of applicant's offenses related to excessive alcohol consumption.  Applicant attended alcohol abuse 
counseling, but derived little benefit from it.  He continues to drink alcohol, although he asserts he no longer drives after drinking.  Applicant has not met his 
burden of demonstrating clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.  I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions do not apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I carefully considered the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case, in light of the "whole person"concept.  I conclude Applicant has<STRONG> </STRONG>not mitigated the 
security concerns arising from his history of criminal conduct.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>
