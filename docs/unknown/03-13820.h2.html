<P>Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor who was arrested and convicted of two armed robberies when he was 21 years old and served three 
years and six months in confinement. While in prison, Applicant realized the foolishness of his ways, changed his attitudes and conduct, and that has been the 
model for his life. Since his confinement, Applicant has led an exemplary life working with a national community service agency on rehabilitation of young 
persons. Applicant has held a security clearance since 1989. However, the law requires that the finding must be adverse since he was incarcerated for more than 
one year. I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986 and am joined by the government in that recommendation. Clearance is 
denied. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On December 31, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
<P>On January 28, 2004, Applicant, in a sworn written statement, responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned 
to me on May 12, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on June 15, 2004. A hearing was held on June 22, 2004. The Government introduced two exhibits. The 
Applicant introduced seven exhibits with sub-parts to each. All of the exhibits were admitted into evidence. The Applicant was the only witness. The transcript 
was received on July 1, 2003. I issued a decision on October 19, 2004, concluding that the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 986 and the implementing regulations 
precluded a finding for Applicant because of his conviction and sentence to more than one year in jail. I recommended further consideration of the case for a 
waiver under the provisions of DOHA Operating Instruction No. 64 &para; 3.e (July 10, 2001). The Director, DOHA, declined to recommend a waiver. </P> 
<P>In 2004, Section 986 was amended by Section 1062 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 limiting the prohibition on granting 
security clearances to those who are not only convicted and sentenced to more than one year but who were incarcerated as a result of the conviction for at least 
one year. Applicant appealed to the Appeal Board on November 20, 2004, and the matter was remanded to me on August 9, 2005, to take additional evidence, 
to issue a new decision consistent with the Directive, and to determine if Section 1062 has any effect on Applicant's case. I issued an order on September 6, 
2005, giving an opportunity to both Applicant and the government to submit additional evidence. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record, the following findings of fact are made:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 53-year-old employee if a defense contractor who was arrested and convicted of armed robberies in two different counties in 1971 when he was 
21 years old and sentenced to a total of 5 to 12 years of confinement. He served three years in one county and six months in another. </P> 
<P>The crimes were the result of falling in with a bad crowd who were committing robberies. He joined them on two robberies in two counties. No one was injured 
in either robbery and Applicant was the</P> 
<P>only one of the group who was apprehended and tried. He pled guilty. While in prison, Applicant realized the foolishness of his transgressions and changed his 
attitudes and conduct, and that has been the model for his life since then. He studied in prison, obtained skills, and received recommendations from the prison 
supervisors to shorten his sentence. </P> 
<P>Since his confinement, Applicant has led an exemplary life working with a national community service agency on rehabilitation of young persons. In 1985 he 
was named the organization's outstanding young man of the year. Applicant and his wife have taken in 27 foster children over the years and are active in 
community affairs.  </P> 
<P>Applicant is highly regarded by his employer and has received numerous corporate and civic awards as illustrated in his lengthy exhibits. He held a security 
clearance since 1989 with no security violations. Pursuant to my Order of September 6, 2005, both Applicant and Department Counsel submitted additional 
evidence. Applicant related his loss of employment and inability to find meaningful employment as a result of the loss of his security clearance. Department 
Counsel noted that Applicant's conduct since his conviction in 1971 presents a compelling case for the grant of a waiver. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b)<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant's admissions, the Government established reasons to deny him a security clearance because of criminal 
conduct. The applicable Disqualifying Condition Criminal Conduct (DC) 2 is applies to Applicant in that he was convicted of a serious crime and sentenced to 
a five year term in prison. Having established such reasons, the Applicant has the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, 
mitigates, or extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 
99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's criminal conduct is mitigated by Mitigating Conditions (MC) l, the conduct was not recent; 2, the crime was an 
isolated incident; 4 the factors leading to the violations are not likely to recur; and 5, there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having observed Applicant at the hearing, I conclude he is a person of serious demeanor who has been totally rehabilitated since his release from prison. He is 
an active member of his community. He receives credit under the whole person concept for long and continuous service to his community and dedication to 
work with others who might be in a similar position as he was as a young man. The record is replete with documentation of his accomplishments and honors 
since his release from prison. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record in this matter is confusing in that the reports indicate several more offenses than occurred since transfers of confinement facilities are reported as if 
they were the product of additional offenses. Applicant has clarified this to my satisfaction. He is completely rehabilitated and has not had any legal difficulties 
since his release from prison in 1975. He has a stable marriage of  25 years. His employment record is impressive having been recognized on numerous 
occasions for service to his company and country.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The "whole person" concept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts 
and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, 
and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The provisions of 10 U.S.C. 986 and the implementing regulations are unequivocal that a person is disqualified from holding a security clearance if convicted 
of a crime and sentenced to more than one year of imprisonment. Although that provision has been amended to require incarceration of one year for 
disqualification from holding a security clearance , and that amendment is applicable to Applicant since he did serve more than one year, a waiver is still 
required for obtaining a security clearance. Thus, the only relief available to Applicant is through a waiver by the Secretary of Defense so I must find against the 
Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, applying the whole person concept to Applicant's case, I believe that he has successfully been rehabilitated and is worthy of future trust by the 
government. I adhere to my original recommendation, and conclude that a compelling case has been made for the grant of a waiver in this matter so that his 
security clearance can be restored. Applicant has made a most compelling case for rehabilitation and qualification for a waiver. His case is bolstered by the 
recommendation for a waiver from Department Counsel. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In view of the continued applicability of Section 986, I must conclude that he is not eligible for access to classified information absent a waiver. Thus, I find 
against the Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS </SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1. Guideline J:  AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.a.:  For Applicant</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.b.:  For Applicant</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.c.:  For Applicant</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.d.:  Against Applicant</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or renew a security clearance 
for Applicant. The provisions of 10 U.S.C. 986 and the implementing regulations preclude such a finding because of Applicant's conviction, sentence, and the 
period of time served. However, I adhere to my original recommendation for further consideration of the case for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. 986. Clearance is 
denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
