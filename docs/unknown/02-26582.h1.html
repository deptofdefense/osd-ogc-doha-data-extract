<P>Applicant's mother and four siblings are citizens and  residents of Vietnam. They are not in a position to be exploited by Vietnam in a way that could force 
Applicant to choose between loyalty to her family members and her loyalty to the United States. Applicant has given some money to her mother in Vietnam, but 
the amount is not significant. Applicant's strong attachment to the United States and minimal ties to Vietnam makes it unlikely that she would respond 
favorably to any efforts to act against United States interests.  Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On March 11, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">March 17, 2004</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant submitted a signed and sworn response to the SOR. Applicant requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 20, 2004, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A notice, dated July 1, 2004, indicated 
that Applicant's employment was terminated on August 31, 2004, and she would not require a security clearance from her employer. After Applicant informed 
the Government that she had another employment position in which she would again require a security clearance, a Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties 
on December 21, 2004. The hearing was conducted on January 25, 2005. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 4), and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered no documentary 
exhibits, but she offered her own testimony. The transcript (TR) was received on February 2, 2005.  The record was left open after the hearing for Applicant to 
submit additional evidence.  She submitted two one page letters of reference, dated January 25 and January 28,  2005, respectively, which were not objected to 
and have been entered into evidence as Exhibit A. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B of the Directive because Applicant's immediate family, and 
other persons to whom she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not United States citizens or may be subject to duress, that she has </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> given 
some money to her mother </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in Vietnam, and that she has traveled to her native Vietnam on more than one occasion. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains seven  allegations, 1.a. 
through 1.g., under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  In her response to the SOR, Applicant admits all seven allegations. These allegations are incorporated as 
findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to add an additional allegation, 1.h., which would state, " </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Your two sisters-in-law and one 
brother-in-law are residents and citizens of Vietnam." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant did not object, and allegation 1.h. has been added to the SOR.  Applicant admitted this 
allegation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon 
due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 54 years old. She is employed as an electrical technician by a defense contractor, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">and she seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his 
employment in the defense sector.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> She </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was born in Vietnam, and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">she left Vietnam by boat at night with her family in 1980 to escape the communist ruled Vietnam.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> She became a naturalized 
United States citizen in 1990. Her husband,  two daughters and one son are also naturalized United States citizens. Her second son, who resides in the United 
States, took and passed the test to be a United States citizen in 1994, but through some apparent error, which Applicant could not explain, he has never received 
notice to be sworn in as a U.S. citizen </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Tr at 42- 43)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father, a Vietnam citizen and resident,  died in 1980. Her mother is a citizen of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Vietnam and continues to reside there</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. She is retired and in poor 
health. She does not now nor has she ever had contact with or worked for the Vietnamese government. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> last saw her mother approximately 3 years 
ago. She has contact with her mother, by telephone, every two or three months. Applicant contributes approximately $200 to her mother on a yearly basis,  
although she has sent as much as $500 in a year, if it was needed. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also has three sisters and one brother, who are residents and citizens of Vietnam. The sisters all work together in a family business,  involving food 
supply. Her brother is a glasscutter. None of them have ever worked for the Vietnamese government. Her contact with them is limited and sporadic. She also 
has one brother who resides in the United States and is a U.S. citizen.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, Applicant has two sisters-in-law and one brother-in-law, who are residents and citizens of Vietnam. Neither Applicant or her husband has been in 
contact with any of them in many years.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since Applicant  first moved to the United States in 1980, she has traveled to Vietnam on  two occasions, in 1996, and again at the end of  2001 until January 
12, 2002. The latter trip was to see her ailing mother (Tr at 37-38).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has no financial interest or property in Vietnam. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">She testified that she would never do anything to compromise the United States. If her mother or any family member was ever threatened by the government of 
Vietnam, she would report it to the proper United States authorities (Tr at 34-35). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted two letters of reference from coworkers on her behalf.  The letters spoke highly about her honesty and trustworthiness </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Exhibit A)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> considered</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother and siblings are citizens and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">residents of</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Vietnam. The Vietnam citizenship and residency of a member of Applicant's immediate 
family creates the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable 
to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such a tie raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, 
extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security 
clearance for him. This </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has done. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The evidence of family members, who are citizens and  residents of Vietnam, comes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1.  The fact that the 
foreign country in question is Vietnam, a country under communist rule, is also a concern; but that fact is not automatically controlling. Based on the nature of 
the overall record and the totality of the evidence, including: the age and lack of government involvement of Applicant's mother and siblings, Applicant's long 
history since coming to the United States, her ties to all of her family members, who are United States citizens, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and  her testimony about her feelings 
concerning the United States</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, I have determined that her family in Vietnam does not constitute an unacceptable security risk, and Mitigating Conditions (MC) 
E2.A2.1.3.1.  applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant does contribute some funds to her mother under DC E2.A2.1.2.8., but the amount is small. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude that MC E2.A2.1.3.5. applies because t</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he 
financial interests are not </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">significant enough to cause Applicant to do anything which would be contrary to the interests of the United States. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">         After considering all of the evidence of record on these issues, I conclude that the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the 
SOR, and even in the unlikely event pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, she would resist it, and would  report the 
incident to the proper authorities.</SPAN></P>
