</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">On December 16, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant alleging facts which raise 
security concerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference), and Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not find that it is 
clearly in the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In a sworn written statement, dated December 22, 2004, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) and elected to have his case decided on the written record in 
lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material (FORM) in support of the government's preliminary decision, a copy of which was 
received by Applicant on February 4, 2005.  Applicant was afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation by March 5, 2005.  Applicant submitted a response to the FORM by letter dated January 29, 2005.  On February 18, 2005, Department Counsel's

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Applicant has admitted to one of two factual allegations pertaining to foreign preference under Guideline C  and all allegations of foreign influence under 
Guideline B.  Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a thorough review of the record as a whole, I make the following additional 
findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Applicant is a married, 30-year-old employee of a federal contractor.<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  She was born in the People's Republic of China (PRC) and lived with her family until 
immigrating to the U. S. in 1994, to attend college.  She married a natural born citizen in 1996, and became a U. S. citizen in 2002. She subsequently was issued 
a U. S. passport.  She last used her Hong Kong passport in 1998, one of three trips to China since 1995.  She believed that because Hong Kong does not 
recognize dual citizenship that she automatically relinquished her Chinese citizenship when she became a naturalized U. S. citizen.  Likewise, she thought her 
passport expired in the same manner.<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  She has subsequently cancelled her Hong Kong passport which accompanied her change of nationality form, effective 
February 4, 2005.<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Applicant's parents, sister, half-brother, two great-aunts and one great-uncle reside in Hong Kong.  Her grandmother and two great-uncles live in the PRC.  She 
maintains a close relationship with her parents and sister.  Since September 11, 2001, her mother started calling her daily to make sure she was safe.  Since that 
time they talk almost daily.  They never discuss her employment.  None of her family has any political or religious ties that would focus attention on them by 
the Chinese government.<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  She calls her other family members in China during the Chinese New Year holiday as a courtesy.  She also maintains telephone 
contact with three friends living in China about every three months.  She has visited her family in PRC and Hong Kong three times since 1995.  She monthly 
sends money to her parents out of respect, not as it is needed or as an obligation.  Her family and friends living in PRC and Hong Kong know nothing of her 
work.<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In July 1997, PRC resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and established the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Hong Kong has a 
high degree of autonomy in all maters except foreign and defense affairs, and has retained its political, economic, and judicial systems since 1997.<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  "Hong 
Kong remains a free open society where human rights are respected, the courts remain independent, and there is well established and longstanding respect for 
the rule of law," although there were alleged irregularities in the fall 2004 legislative council elections which the government is investigating.<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Moreover, Hong 
Kong is a strong ally of the U. S. in the global coalition against terrorism.<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">"[No] one has a 'right' to a security clearance."<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on 
national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such 
information."<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history 
affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom 
from conflicting allegiances and potential coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing use, handling, and protection of classified 
information."<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> An 
administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth &sect; E.2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">, are 
intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the surrounding circumstances of the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven 
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides industrial security decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of 
the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this 
Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG>GUIDELINE B - FOREIGN INFLUENCE:  (FI), Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG><EM>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including 
cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligations are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may 
be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. 
Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual 
potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG>GUIDELINE C</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG> (foreign preference) (FP), Directive, &para; E2.A3.1.1. </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG><EM>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country 
over the United Sates, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">On August 16, 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD/C</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><SUP>3</SUP>I) issued a passport policy 
"clarification" pertaining to Guideline C - foreign preference.<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG>  </STRONG>A photocopy was furnished Applicant.  The memorandum states, in pertinent part:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify the application of Guideline C to cases involving an applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport.  The 
guideline specifically provides that "possession and/or use of a foreign passport" may be a disqualifying condition.  It contains no mitigating factor related to 
the applicant's personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country.  The only applicable mitigating factor addresses 
the official approval of the United States Government for the possession or use.  The security concerns underlying this guideline are that the possession and use 
of a foreign passport in preference to a U. S. Passport raises a doubt as to whether the person's allegiance to the United States is paramount and it could also 
facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by the United States. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG><EM>Therefore, consistent application of the guideline requires any clearance be denied or revoked 
unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government.  
</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Modification of the guideline is not required. (Emphasis supplied.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Since the protection of the national security is the paramount determinant, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest."  For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on th evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere 
speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance."<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">A person who has access to classified information enters into a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">confidence. The 
Government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will 
protect the national interests as his or her own.  The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an 
Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG><EM>1.  Foreign Influence Guideline</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The Government established its case under Guideline B.  Applicant has been portrayed as a person who has a potential security risk because members of her 
immediate family or persons to whom she is bound by affection, influence, or obligation - in this instance her parents, sister, and half-brother are citizen 
residents of Hong Kong - and may be subject to duress.  These situations raise the potential for vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure, and the 
exercise of foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  However, the mere possession of family ties with a person in a 
foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The language of [Guideline] B (Foreign Influence) in the Adjudicative Guidelines makes clear that the possession of such family ties </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><EM>may</EM> pose a security risk.  
Whether an applicant's family ties in a foreign country pose a security risk depends upon a common sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of 
those family ties.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0419 (April 30, 1999) at p.5.<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Applicant's husband is a native-born U. S. Citizen, and only the continuing Hong Kong citizenship of her immediate family members raise the potential issue of 
foreign influence.  In this regard, see Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><EM>an immediate family member, or a person to whom the 
individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen or present in, a foreign country</EM>).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">However, also applicable, in this instance is Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">E2.A2.1.3.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><EM>a determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitants, or associate(s) in 
question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by foreign power in a way that would force the individual to choose between loyalty 
to the person(s) involved and the United States</EM>).  After an examination of the evidence, I determine that Applicant's parents, sister, half-brother, great-aunts and 
great-uncle, considering their Hong Kong citizenship, residency, and work status, do not constitute an unacceptable security risk.  Furthermore, their continuing 
personal relationship has no security significance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Also applicable in this case is FI MC and FI MC E2.A2.1.3.5. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><EM>foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security 
responsibilities</EM>).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">  Applicant's trips to Hong Kong and the PRC in 1995, 1998, and 2003, were to visit family and friends and appear innocuous.  Her phone calls 
with her mother are the result of calming her mother's natural concern for her daughter in a time of worldwide terrorist threats.  Applicant has not engaged in 
any misconduct such as to render her an inappropriate candidate for a security clearance.  Considering the absence of any scintilla of evidence that Applicant's 
family and friends are targets of any intelligence gathering efforts, their residency status does not establish any doubts regarding possible duress. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">I note with some interest that no evidence has been offered by the Government indicating any sinister Hong Kong intentions or activities, such as industrial 
espionage or active collection of foreign economic information, directed toward the United States.  Although the PRC has an abusive civil rights record<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> and is 
among the most active collectors of intelligence from U. S. sources<A HREF="03-23349.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>, Applicant's immediate family live in Hong Kong.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The fact that extended family members 
live in the PRC must be contrasted with the resounding support for Hong Kong, "a free and open society where human rights are respected, the courts remain 
independent, and there is a well established and longstanding respect for the rule of law."  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> Thus I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the government's case with respect to 
Guideline B.  Accordingly, allegations 2.a through 2.h of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant find for Applicant.</SPAN></P>

The ASD/C</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><SUP>3</SUP>I memo states there are no mitigating factors "related to 
applicant's personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country," a phrase which I construe to relate solely to the use 
of a foreign passport, and not to mere possession of the same.  On the other hand, the memo requires a clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant 
"surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government."  Applicant's actions in 
surrendering her passport and renouncing her citizenship by obtaining a Declaration of Change of Nationality in February 2005, makes the issue moot.
