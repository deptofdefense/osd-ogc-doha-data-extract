<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 49 year-old native born United States citizen, who served honorably for seven years in the United States Air Force.  Applicant's wife, a citizen of 
Russia,  has  resided in the United States for seven years and is in the process of becoming a United States citizen. The evidence establishes that, because of

<P>On <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">September 18, 2003, t</SPAN>he Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 
11328 and 12829) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR), to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct 
proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. The SOR was based on Foreign Influence (Guideline B) 
concerns.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant filed a notarized response, dated <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">October 10, 2003</SPAN>, to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative 
Judge.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 29, 2004, this case was assigned to another Administrative Judge, but because of medical considerations, on May 10, 2004, the case was reassigned to 
this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was originally issued to the parties on June 4, 2004, and the 
hearing was set for June 24, 2004. Applicant's counsel filed a Motion to Continue the hearing, which was granted for good cause, and the hearing was 
ultimately held on July 7, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-4), and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered 17 documentary exhibit 
(Exhibits A-Q) and offered his own testimony. All of the documents were accepted into evidence without objection. The transcript was received on July 27, 
2004.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B of the Directive because Applicant's immediate family, 
specifically his wife and other family members are not United States citizens and some reside in a country other than the United State. The SOR includes </SPAN>four 
allegations<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). </SPAN>In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the allegations 1.a. through ,1.d. The admitted allegations 
are incorporated as findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon 
due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 49 year old employee of a defense contractor, and he seeks a security clearance. He is a native </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">born United States citizen. Applicant was married 
and divorced two previous times, and he has a 12 year old son from one of the  previous marriages, who is a United States citizen. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was honorably 
discharged from the United States Air Force in 1990. He served from 1983 to 1990 (Exhibit E).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been married to his current wife for seven years. He met her through an international dating agency. His wife was born in Russia and is a Russian 
citizen. She was a special education teacher in Russia. They were married in 1997 in the United States, and she has resided here since then. For the past five 
years she has been a pre-school teacher in a Jewish community center. Currently, she is a permanent resident of the United States, and she is in the process of 
becoming a United States citizen (TR at 28-32).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The mother of Applicant's wife still resides in Russia, and she works as an assistant principal at a public school. His wife and his mother-in-law communicate 
approximately two times a month. Her father is deceased. Applicant's wife's uncle was a general in the army of Russia, but he retired in 1991 and is now in the 
clothing business. His wife communicates with her uncle one or two times a year. Applicant has no regular contact with his wife's mother or uncle.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant traveled to Russia two times in 1996, first to meet the woman, who is now  his wife, in person, and the second time to see her again. The next trip 
was with his wife in 1999, to visit his wife's family. The last trip he made to Russia was in 2000, because of the severe illness of his wife's father (TR at 33-36). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant introduced five letters of recommendation from individuals who have known him personally and professionally, They spoke very highly of 
Applicant's dedication and trustworthiness (Exhibits F-J).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">           Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative 
Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Each 
adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular 
condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this 
policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, etc. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of foreign influence. 
Applicant's wife is a citizen of Russia.  His wife's mother and  uncle are citizens and residents of Russia, and her uncle is a former general in the Russian army. 
The Russian citizenship, residency and Government involvement creates the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern 
sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet her burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A>or continue a security clearance for her. ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). This Applicant has done.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a 
citizen of, or resident in, a foreign country) applies in this case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns, thereby demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant him the 
clearance. This decision is based on the following factors: 1)Applicant is a native born United States citizen, who has lived his entire life in the United States. 
2) Applicant served seven years in the United States Air Force and received an Honorable Discharge. 3) His wife is a permanent resident of the United States 
and is now in the process of becoming a United States citizen. 4) Applicant's contact with his mother-in-law and the uncle of his wife is extremely infrequent.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Accordingly, Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition  (MC)E2.A2.1.3.1. (A determination that the immediate family member(s). . . in question are not agents of 
a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved 
and the United States) applies to this case. </SPAN>MC <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.3.3. </SPAN>also applies because Applicant's contacts with his wife's family in Russia is extremely casual and 
infrequent.    </P> 
 
<P>         After considering all of the evidence of record on these issues, I conclude that the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the 
SOR and even in the unlikely event pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would resist it, and would  report the 
incident to the proper authorities. </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>         <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that Applicant has overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance. Guideline B is found 
for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
