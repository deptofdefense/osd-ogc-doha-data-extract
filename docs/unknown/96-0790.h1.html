<P>On November 25, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make
the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  In a sworn written
statement, dated January 3, 1997, the Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR and requested a hearing.  A copy of the SOR is attached to this
Decision and incorporated herein by reference.</P>

<P>The undersigned Administrative Judge received the case assignment on January 27, 1997, and held a hearing on February 19, 1997<A NAME="date (s) of hearing(s)"></A>.  The Department Counsel
presented three exhibits ("Exhs"), but did not call any witnesses.  The Applicant's case consisted of five exhibits and the testimony of one witness in addition to
his own.  The Applicant's exhibit E was received before February 26, 1997, <EM>i.e.</EM>, within the time limit set at the hearing.  The undersigned Administrative Judge
received the transcript ("Tr") of the hearing on March 4, 1997.</P>

<P><STRONG><U>RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</STRONG></U></P>

<P>Exhibit 1 was presented by the Government and admitted into evidence without objection.  Tr pages 19-20.  Exhibit 1 is an unsigned, typewritten excerpt from
Form 86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions.  The decision, however, does not rely upon this exhibit because the exhibit is neither complete nor does
it bear a signature or date.</P>

<P><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></STRONG></P>

<P>The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on one criterion: paragraph 1, Criterion G (alcohol consumption).  The Applicant has
admitted the factual allegations contained in each subparagraph of the SOR.  Except as noted herein, the Applicant's admissions are hereby incorporated as
findings of fact.</P>

<P>The undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, makes the
following additional Findings of Fact:</P>

<P>The Applicant is a 33-year-old ---------- employed since 1987 by a U.S. Government contractor.  The Applicant seeks to retain a Secret personnel security
clearance.</P>

<P>The Applicant began drinking alcohol to excess in his teens.  He has a pattern of binge drinking interspersed with periods of sobriety.  He has at times
experienced numerous blackouts and has had the "shakes," even at work.  Tr pages 70-74.  After he graduated from high school, he served in the military as an
enlisted man for 4+ years, during which time he married.  In October 1991 he was divorced.  One of the significant causal factors in the uncontested divorce was
his ex-wife's complaint of his excessive drinking.  Tr pages 55-57, 114-115.  Due to his deteriorating relationship with his wife the Applicant voluntarily
admitted himself as inpatient into a hospital's mental health unit on August 14, 1991.  The Applicant was diagnosed by his treating physician as suffering from,
<EM><STRONG>inter alia</STRONG></EM>, alcohol dependency and severe depression.  He was discharged on September 6, 1991, into an aftercare outpatient counseling program (in connection
with his employer's Employee Assistance Program) and a local Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) group.  The Applicant took his first alcoholic drink after treatment
in October 1991 when he was divorced, but remained sober thereafter for about eight months.  Tr pages 76-77.  He attended AA meetings from October 1991 to
July 1992.  Exhibit E.  The Applicant lived with his girl friend, who was heavily involved with alcohol, from April 1992 to May 1995.  Tr page 110; exhibit 2. 
He was sober again during the period October 1993 through May 1995 with the renewed support of consistent AA attendance.  Tr pages 97-106, 110; exhibit E. 
The Applicant resumed alcoholic consumption in about  May 1995 and plans to continue drinking.  Exhibit 2; tr pages 79-83, 96-97, 111.  He denies that he  is
an alcoholic and does not currently attend AA meetings.  Tr pages 84, 117.  </P>

<P>On the evening of March 17, 1996, the Applicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of alcohol (DUI).  During that period of time he was suffering a
"bout of depression" and was taking two prescription medicines, Prozac and Klonopin.  Tr pages 41, 43, 93-96; exhibit 2, page 1.  Prozac is an antidepressant,
and Klonopin is an anti-seizure medicine.<A HREF="96-0790.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  The Applicant believes that the latter was prescribed for symptoms of anxiety.  He had been drinking a total of
about eight beers during the afternoon, with dinner, and after dinner on March 17, 1996.  He deliberately waited two hours after drinking his last beer before
driving his automobile.  When arrested he was under the influence of alcohol and his prescription medicines.  Tr page 91.  The arresting officer told the
Applicant that he had a strong odor of alcohol about his person and, later, that the Applicant had failed some field sobriety tests.  Upon being arrested, the
Applicant refused to take a breathalyzer test, even though he knew that his operator's permit would thereby be suspended, because he was unsure whether the
breathalyzer would mistakenly register his ingestion of prescription medicines rather than alcohol.  Tr page 93.  The Applicant was released from jail the next
day on a $500 bond.  On May 21, 1996, he pleaded <EM>nolo contendere</EM> to a reduced charge of "Less than Safe," found guilty thereof, and was sentenced to 90 days
in jail suspended upon payment of a $380 fine plus costs, four months' unsupervised probation, and 40 hours of community service.  He was also required to
complete a DUI Driver course in order to regain his operator's license.</P>

<P>His performance on the job has been satisfactory, and he possesses "some very good talents."  He has never been drunk or smelling of alcohol while at work.  Tr
pages 123-134; exhibits A, B, D.</P>

<P><U><STRONG>POLICIES</U></STRONG></P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluation of an individual's
security eligibility.  The guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or revoke a clearance (Disqualifying
Conditions or DC) and those that may be considered in determining whether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified information (Mitigating
Conditions or MC).  In evaluating this case, relevant adjudicative guidelines as set forth below have been carefully con-sidered as the most pertinent to the facts
of this particular case.</P>

<P>The criteria, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating conditions most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case are:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>CRITERION G - ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of
unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG>  </P>

<P>  (1) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to
alcohol use; </P>

<P>  (2) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job; </P>

<P>  (3) diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional<FONT SIZE="-1"><FONT FACE="Times"><SUP></FONT></FONT></SUP> (cre-dentialed medical professional: licensed physician, licensed clinical psychologist, or board certified
psych-iatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence;</P>

<P>  (4) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment; </P>

<P>  (5) consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed medical professional (credentialed medical professional: licensed
physician, licensed clinical psychologist, or board certified psych-iatrist) and following completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P>

<P>None applicable.</P>

<P>The Directive also requires the undersigned to consider, as appropriate, the factors enumerated in Section F.3:</P>

<P>a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</P>

<P>b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P>

<P>c. Age of the applicant.</P>

<P>d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences
involved.</P>

<P>e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P>

<P>f. Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</P>

<P>Enclosure 2 to the Directive provides that the adjudicator should consider the following factors:</P>

<P>The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</P>

<P>The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P>

<P>The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<P>The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<P>The voluntariness of participation</P>

<P>The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes</P>

<P>The motivation for the conduct</P>

<P>The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</P>

<P>The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</P>

<P>Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made
only upon an affirmative finding that to do so is <U>clearly consistent</U> with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense
determination required, the Administrative Judge may only draw those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of
record.  Determinations under the Directive include consideration of the risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly
classified information as that term is defined and established under Executive Order 12958, effective on October 14, 1995.</P>

<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme Court has said:</P>

<P>It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence standard without departing
from the 'clearly consistent with the interests of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations
should err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government to support the denial [of a security clearance] by a preponderance of the
evidence would inevitably shift the emphasis and involve the Board in second-guessing the agency's national security determinations.</P>

<P> <EM>Dept. of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that Supreme Court guidance in its context to go to the minimum
<STRONG><EM>quantum</EM></STRONG> of the admissible evidence that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its case, that is, substantial evidence but something
less than a preponderance of the evidence -- rather than as an indication of the Court's tolerance for error below.<A HREF="96-0790.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his security eligibility through evidence of refutation,
extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case or through evidence of affirmative defenses.  Assuming the Government's case is not refuted, and further
assuming it can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an applicant might deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified
information, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he is nonetheless eligible to hold a security clearance.<A HREF="96-0790.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility and demeanor of those who
testified, the undersigned concludes that the Government established its case with regard to Criterion G.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">The Applicant has had a long history of binge drinking, has experienced blackouts and the "shakes," and has suffered disruption of his family life due in part to
alcohol.  He has been diagnosed as alcohol dependent by a credential medical professional.  He has resumed drinking after inpatient treatment, outpatient
counseling, and periodic Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) participation.  The Applicant admits that he has had the "shakes" at work.  He still denies that he is an
alcoholic.  He has been arrested for DUI less than a year before the close of the record.  He admits that he was under the influence of alcohol when he was
arrested.   He was required to complete a DUI Driver course to regain his operator's license that was suspended because he refused to take a breathalyzer test
when arrested.  He is still drinking alcohol and is neither currently attending AA meetings nor seeking treatment for alcoholism.  Each of the five DCs cited on
page 4 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM> have application to the facts of this case.  The Applicant has offered little in the way of mitigating or extenuating evidence; certainly the MCs
pertaining to Criterion G are inapplicable to those facts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Each case decision is required to consider, as appropriate, the factors listed in Section F.3 and enclosure 2 to the Directive.  Those factors are identified on page
5 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  The Applicant has a serious and continuing alcohol problem that he denies.  The absence of current rehabilitation as well as the relapse after treatment
received as an inpatient in a hospital--and, indeed, education in the course of alcoholism--suggest recurring and deepening health problems yet await the
Applicant.</FONT></P>
