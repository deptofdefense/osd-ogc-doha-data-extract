<P>Applicant's personal conduct, drug use, and criminal conduct raise security concerns.   He knowingly and willfully omitted adverse information from his 
security form and misrepresented information about his employment history and past and current drug use.  Applicant failed to meet his duty to disclose his 
illegal drug use that continued until March 2000 even though he understood such marijuana use was against the government's security policies.  His hard work 
and favorable references do not erase the security significance of these material false statements; while to his credit he has abstained from any marijuana use for 
three years, security concerns persist over  his drug use which continued even after he applied for a security clearance.  Clearance is denied. </P>

</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on September 12, 2002.  The SOR detailed 
reasons why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="01-20558.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over personal conduct (Guideline E), drug use (Guideline H), and criminal conduct (Guideline J). 
Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized November 25, 2002, where he admitted all of the allegations in paragraphs 1 and 2; he 
requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel who on December 17 , 2002, attested it was ready to proceed; on that day the case was assigned to another 
administrative judge, but immediately re-assigned to me.  Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for hearing was agreed to; a Notice of Hearing was issued 
on January 7, 2003, which set the matter for January 30, 2003, at a location near where Applicant works and lives.  At the hearing the Government offered into 
evidence eight Government exhibits; all were admitted into evidence. (Exhibits 1-8)  The Applicant represented himself and  testified; he requested seven days 
to submit exhibits.  I granted him seven days until February 6, 2003 and allowed the Department Counsel until February 12, 2003, to review them.    (TR 28-30; 
48, 55)  On February 6, 2003, Applicant offered eight exhibits into evidence.  Department Counsel reviewed them and offered no objection to these exhibits 
being admitted into evidence.  (Exhibits A-H)    The exhibits were admitted into evidence and the record closed.  The  transcript (TR) was received on February 
13, 2003.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Procedural Issues</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to the evidence:</P> 
<UL> 
  <LI>2.c. to amend the date of Applicant's arrest to conform with Exhibit 5, and </LI> 
  <LI>2.d. to amend the date that he had used marijuana during his lunch period to conform with Exhibit 8.   </LI> 
<P>As Applicant did not object, I granted the technical amendments.  (TR 19-21)</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant, 37 years old, has worked for Company #1 since November 1985; however he has had frequent layoffs.  In his current job he does not need a security 
clearance, but he would need one to be promoted.  He has also had a part-time job with Company #2 from May 1998 to present. He has also worked for 
Company #3 from 1994 to February 1998.  He's maintained two jobs for a ten year period.  (Exhibits 1, 2; TR 25-28, 45-47, 53-54)  He has never held a 
security clearance. (TR 31)  His first love is music; he has been a deejay, played in a band, recorded music, and run light shows for bands.  (TR 37-38, 46-47)</P> 
<P>Applicant has a child born in 1988.  (Exhibits 1, 2; TR 38)</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct, Drug Use, and</STRONG> <STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>In February 2000 Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) but only disclosed part of the required adverse information.  In response to 
Question 20 in the SF 86 concerning his employment record, he stated he left a job with Company #3 in February 1998 by "mutual agreement following 
allegations of unsatisfactory performance"; he failed to note that he had left this employer in February 1998 for misconduct.  Also, he falsely answered "no" in 
response to Question 27 about illegal drug use.  However, he did disclose his 1999 arrest for "possession of a weapon &amp; pipe" and a $98 fine.  (Exhibit 1, TR 
24)  Applicant conceded that he "lied basically" about the "no" answer to drug use as he needed his job.  At the time he filled out the security form he was still 
using marijuana and continued to use it through March 2000.  (TR 33-35)</P> 
<P>Finally, when he was interviewed by the Defense Security Service (DSS) in February 2001, he disclosed he used marijuana at age 11 in 1975 and he continued 
to use it in varying amounts until March 2000.  In addition he experimented with other drugs - yellow jackets (barbiturates) , robin eggs (LSD), Christmas trees 
(LSD), and cocaine.  Also, he purchased about $20 worth of marijuana monthly from 1984 to 2000.  In September 1999 he was arrested for three charges: (1) 
displaying unauthorized registration plates, (2) possession of drug paraphernalia, and (3) possession of prohibited weapon. Counts 1 and 2 were dismissed and 
he pled guilt to Count 3 in a plea agreement; he was fined $230.  He did possess drug paraphernalia.  In March 2000 he failed a drug test conducted by 
Company #1; he was suspended from work for three weeks and ordered to undergo drug counseling.   From April to July 2000 he attended drug treatment.  He 
stopped using marijuana in March 2000 as he did not want to lose his job or his new girlfriend.  He has no intention of using any illegal drugs in the future and 
no longer associates with the friends with whom he used drugs.  (Answer; Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 5, 6; TR 24-25, 36-42)  In April 2000 Company #1 reported the 
adverse information regarding Applicant's positive drug test.  (Exhibit 8)</P> 
<P>His drug treatment records record that Applicant was "cooperative" in his treatment from April to July 2000.  His provisional and final diagnoses were 305.20, 
Cannabis Dependence Features, Adjustment Disorder with Depression.    (Exhibit 6)</P> 
<P>Employment records from Company #2 disclosed he was given a misconduct discharge in February 1998 after a series of warnings:  a co-worker filed a formal 
complaint about Applicant's conduct in May 1996 and he was given a verbal warning; in November 1997 he was given another Conduct Warning for 
inappropriate touching of a co-worker; in January 1998 he was given another Conduct Warning after he was presented with a " performance warning" and used 
vulgar language to his supervisor; in February 1998 he received another Conduct Warning for use of inappropriate language.  When he was interviewed by DSS 
in February 2002, he admitted that his "performance was lacking" with Employer #3 in 1998; he used inappropriate language and was given two warnings for 
this conduct as well as counseled on performance issues.  He admitted he "was not fully truthful when answering question 20" on his security form.  He should 
have stated that the reasons for his termination was "inappropriate conduct, using inappropriate language around co-workers and supervisor."  He did not 
include this information as he did not want these circumstances known by the workers at Company #1.  (Exhibits 1, 4; TR 31-33, 43-45)</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>References</STRONG></CENTER>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a

<P>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  The Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</P> 
<P> </P> 
<P>  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Government clearly established security concerns over Applicant's personal conduct.  Applicant had opportunities on the security form to disclose his past 
employment and drug issues, but he failed to disclose fully all adverse information in answering questions 20 and 27.  Applicant's behavior<A HREF="01-20558.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> reflects 
questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that he may not properly 
safeguard classified information. </P> 
<P> To rebut and overcome the Government's case, Applicant would have to demonstrate that he has mitigated<A HREF="01-20558.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN> this conduct.  His current favorable reference 
letters have to be measured against his knowing and willful failure to disclose required information about his adverse employment termination with Company 
#2 and his drug use.  He had a duty to disclose fully which he failed to meet.</P> 
<P>Further, while Applicant's supervisors and friends submitted references that they believed him to be an honest and trustworthy person, they did not testify at the 
hearing and were not subject to cross-examination, so I give them less weight as it is not clear that they are aware of all of the adverse circumstances.  
Consequently, after a review of him as a whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated his false answers on the security clearance form to the 
question on his past employment history and his past and current drug use.  While he one year later fully disclosed his drug history to the DSS agent, there is no 
evidence that he did so voluntarily and before he was confronted.  Further he was interviewed three times by DSS before he disclosed all of the facts about his 
past adverse employment history.   Thus, his knowing failure to make these required disclosures raises security concerns as he neglected to give truthful 
answers to questions that were both relevant and material to his security eligibility.  Applicant's favorable work record and references cannot erase these serious 
security concerns over his misleading conduct in the security clearance process.  Hence, after considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraph 1.a. and 1.b. under SOR Paragraph 1.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Use</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Government established security concerns over Applicant's intermittent marijuana use  from 1975 to March 2000.  He also used several other drugs on an 
experimental basis and had a drug paraphernalia arrest in 1999 that was dismissed.  He purchased marijuana on a regular basis and continued to use marijuana 
even after he completed a security form in February 2000 where he was questioned about such illegal drug use and was put on notice that such drug use  was 
inconsistent with being granted access to classified information.  Indeed, he used marijuana several times after he had applied for a security clearance.  In March 
2000 someone observed him use marijuana on his lunch hour; he was subsequently tested; and the results were positive for marijuana use.   He went to 
treatment as mandated by his employer and was diagnosed with Cannabis Dependency Features.</P> 
<P>Subsequently, Applicant has made a convincing commitment in March 2000 to avoid all future drug use and was involved in a treatment program from April to 
July 2000.  To his credit he has not use any marijuana in almost three years and no longer associates with the friends with whom he used drugs.  Given his 
record of good work and his dedication to advance himself, I believe he has mitigated his  past drug use in part<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under MC (1) The drug involvement was not 
recent; and MC (3) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future</SPAN>.  On the other hand, for Applicant to use drugs as alleged in 2.d. when he knew or 
should have known that such illegal drug use was against the government's policies, raises ample questions about his judgment overall.  Thus, after considering 
the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraphs 2.a., 2.b., 2.c., 2.e. 2.f., 2.g. 2.h., 2.i., and 
2.j. but against Applicant on subparagraph 2.d. incorporated under SOR Paragraph 2.</P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Government established security concerns over Applicant's criminal conduct  under Title 18 United States Code Section 1001<A HREF="01-20558.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
<P> as he falsified answers to 
two  questions on the federal security form by failing to disclose the details of his 1998 termination from Company #2 and gave misleading answers on the form 
about the recency and frequency of his marijuana use.  Although he was never prosecuted under this statute or convicted, his conduct, as discussed above under 
personal conduct, falls within that statute as his false answers to the employment and drug questions were given "knowingly and willfully."  </P> 
<P>To his credit, Applicant has a good work record and favorable references which indicate partial rehabilitation. However, he should have fully disclosed his 
adverse employment background and his drug use on the government form.  His knowing failure to make these required disclosures raises continuing concerns 
about his security worthiness  under Title 18 United States Code Section 1001.  Thus, after considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraph 3.a. incorporated under SOR Paragraph 3. </P> 
<P> </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER>
