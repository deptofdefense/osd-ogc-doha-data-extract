<P>Applicant has a history of drinking to the point of intoxication that continued until at least the end of May 2005. He also deliberately omitted relevant and

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 22 November 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-19273.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 7 December 2004 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case 
was assigned to me on 20 May 2005. On 21 June 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 29 June 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 32-year-old senior engineering analyst for a defense contactor. He has worked for his present employer for nine years. Applicant has an excellent 
record of performance and is deemed by his supervisors to be a loyal and trustworthy employee.</P> 
<P>Applicant started using illegal drugs in 1988. Ex. 3 at 6. In August 1992, Applicant was stopped for speeding. He was arrested and charged with possession of 
marijuana, under two ounces, after the officer found three marijuana cigarettes on his person. He was found guilty and paid a fine of $500. Applicant was only 
19 years old at the time of his arrest. He was scared and he claims it had quite an impact on him. Tr. 40-41. Nevertheless, he continued to use illegal drugs, 
including marijuana, cocaine, and methamphetamine until 1994. Ex. 3 at 6-7.</P> 
<P>In September 1994, Applicant accepted his brother's invitation to move to another city to get away from his drug using friends. Applicant last used illegal drugs 
in 1994. </P> 
<P>Applicant began drinking alcohol while he was in high school-his father is an alcoholic who has been arrested six times for driving under the influence of 
alcoholic beverages (DUI). Applicant has consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication for many years. Applicant has described himself as an alcoholic and 
admitted having experienced blackouts and gray outs (unable to recall all or part of his actions while drinking). Ex. 3 at 5. In November 1994, after he moved in 
with his brother, Applicant was arrested for speeding and DUI. His blood alcohol level was .18%, in excess of the state standard of .10%. Applicant pled guilty 
to the lesser offense of driving while ability impaired (DWAI). He was sentenced to one year of probation, 24 hours of community serviced, a fine, and was 
ordered to attend an alcohol education awareness program. </P> 
<P>Applicant was arrested in December 2002 and charged with DUI and speeding. His blood alcohol level was .22%. Tr. 50. Upon the advice of his attorney, 
Applicant attended a Level 2 alcohol education awareness program and performed 75 hours of community service before his case went to court. </P> 
<P>Applicant continues to drink, although he denies that he has driven while intoxicated since his 2002 arrest. He has been intoxicated approximately eight times 
so far in 2005-the last time being Memorial Day. Tr. 55-56</P> 
<P>Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) on 17 January 2001 in which he certified that his statements were "true, complete, and correct" to 
the best of his knowledge and belief, and acknowledged that a knowing and willful false statement could be punished under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. Ex. 1 at 8. 
Question 24 asked if Applicant had ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs. Applicant answered "yes," and listed his 
1994 arrest for DWAI. He did not list his 1992 arrest and conviction for possession of marijuana. He admitted intentionally omitting the information because he 
did not want his security officer to see the information. Ex. 3 at 8.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G-Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication and blackouts from 1990-2003 (&para; 1.a), pled guilty to DWAI after a 
November 1994 arrest (&para; 1.b), and was arrested in December 2002 and charged with DUI (&para; 1.c). Applicant denied the allegation in &para; 1.a, but admitted the 
others. Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. Directive &para; E2.A7.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions constitute evidence of potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline G</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant was involved 
in alcohol-related incidents away from work (DC E2.A7.1.2.1) and has a history of drinking to the point of impairment-blackouts (DC E2.A7.1.2.5. He admits 
a lengthy history of intoxication and continues to drink to the point of intoxication, as recently as 22 days before the hearing. Under the circumstances, 
Applicant failed to establish the applicability of any mitigating conditions to his case. I find against Applicant on &para; 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant deliberately falsified his SCA by failing to disclose he was charged with possession of marijuana in 1992 (&para; 2.a). In his 
answer, Applicant admitted the arrest, but denied he deliberately falsified his SCA. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, 
lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate the applicant may not properly safeguard classified 
information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions constitute substantial evidence of potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant 
deliberately falsified material facts on his SCA by failing to list his 1992 arrest for possession of marijuana. DC E2.A5.1.2.2. An applicant's use of drugs is 
relevant and material to a determination of his security worthiness. Although Applicant denied in his answer that he deliberately falsified his SCA, I am not 
persuaded. He admitted that his arrest scared him and had a large impact on him during the hearing and he had previously admitted he purposely omitted the 
information so his security officer would not see it. Ex. 3 at 8. None of the mitigating conditions listed under Guideline E apply. I find against Applicant on &para; 2.</SPAN></P>
