  Applicant's security clearance is revoked because of his criminal conduct and sexual behavior.  He has a 1995 felony conviction for Sodomy against a Minor Child, and also engaged in  inappropriate sexual behavior (sexual fondling a minor child from 1993-1995).  He remains on  probation and has not yet demonstrated rehabilitation even though he has continued court-ordered  psychological treatment since 1995 for his disorder.  While he used marijuana from 1984 to 1995  and also experimented with other drugs, that use was dated and minimal, so his drug abuse can now  be mitigated as for two years he has demonstrated his intent to remain drug free.  Clearance denied.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)
to the Applicant on January 21, 1997.  (Copy attached.)  The SOR detailed reasons why the
Government could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="97-0039.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges
Criterion J (pattern of criminal activity) in paragraph 1, Criterion D (sexual behavior) in paragraph
2, and Criterion H (drug use) in paragraph 3.  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations on
February 24, 1997, and requested a decision on the record; he attached a supporting letter from his
counselor dated February 21, 1997.  On March 10, 1997, Department Counsel prepared a File of
Relevant Material (FORM) which Applicant  received on April 10, 1997.  While he had 30 days after
receipt of the FORM to object to any exhibits or to submit information on his own behalf, he did not
respond and the record closed. </P>

<P>	Subsequently, this matter was assigned to me on June 2, 1997, to determine whether it is
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Applicant admitted in his Answer all individual factual allegations in the SOR except
subparagraph 3.e. which he neither admitted nor denied. I incorporate herein these admissions as
findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact:</P>

<P>	Applicant is a 40-year old (DOB: 07/16/57) welder and employee of  a defense contractor
where he has worked since shortly after his high school graduation in 1976.  </P>

<P>	His first marriage ended in divorce in 1983.  Then in 1987 he began living with a woman
who had a five-year-old daughter.  When she was ten to eleven years old, he helped her with her bath
and then would sexually fondle her.  This sexual fondling continued for eighteen months from 1993
to July 1995.  Even though he was acting as a parental figure for this child, he began to see her as
his "equal."  He does not take full responsibility for this conduct but blames the mother for giving
him "too many opportunities to be alone" with her daughter even though she did not know of his
misconduct in fondling the child after he gave her a bath.  Then on July 19, 1995, when she was
fourteen, he performed oral sex on her to "punish her" for wandering in the neighborhood the
previous night.  Later, he rationalized his behavior by saying both that he did this oral sex as a result
of his anger to show her "what a criminal could do to her."</P>

<P>	Subsequently, Applicant was arrested on July 26, 1995, for felony sodomy on this child on
or July 19, 1995.  On December 20, 1995, he pled guilty to Sodomy, a felony, and was sentenced
to confinement in the penitentiary for twelve years, but the Court suspended the sentence imposed
for twenty years<A HREF="97-0039.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> as long as the Applicant met the conditions of the court: to not have any further
contact with the victim, to pay the cost of the victim's counseling, and to continue in counseling
himself and follow all treatment recommendations. </P>

<P>	Applicant had been evaluated by a psychologist on August 1, 7, 14, 18 and September 18.
1995, and continues in therapy with this psychologist.  This expert diagnosed him on admission with
an Adjustment Disorder, with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood (DSM-IV 309.28), but this
expert has submitted no current diagnosis or prognosis.  Initially, Applicant in his sessions revealed
his sexual abuse of the child victim.  Applicant also revealed that he himself as a child had been
sexually abused by his older uncle when the Applicant was four years old and by his older brother
when Applicant was ages eight to ten.   </P>

<P>	From this history this psychologist assessed Applicant to have grossly impaired impulse
control and judgment and to lack insight.  This expert found him to be a regressed sex offender with
a primary sexual interest in adult woman, not a pedophile, with almost addictive sexual behavior.
At  the recommendation of this therapist, Applicant also attended the Parents United group.  </P>

<P>	Applicant began attending that Parents United group on November 15, 1995, and initially
attended eleven out of twelve group therapy sessions.  Initially, he was diagnosed with Major
Depression, recurrent, severe with suicidal ideation without a plan. A social worker for this group
reported on April 9, 1996, that Applicant continued to have problems with self disclosure and
understanding of sexual arousal; he assessed Applicant as needing to show more motivation and
insight into his behavior and to develop external controls to prevent himself from being placed in
high risk situations.  </P>

<P>	On February 21, 1997, his individual counselor recommended that Applicant retain his
security clearance based on his being actively engaged in counseling and therapy since August 1995;
he reported Applicant has made many gains to understanding himself better and made significant
changes in his life.  He found Applicant no longer uses marijuana and is more stable and more
psychologically and emotionally healthy than at any point in his life.  However, this counselor did
not provide a current diagnosis or prognosis on his sexual behavior.</P>

<P>	Applicant began to smoke marijuana in his late 20's and continued to use it until spring 1995 
about six times a year.<A HREF="97-0039.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>  He purchased marijuana half the time and spent $10 each time.  He also
snorted cocaine once fifteen years ago and "crank" about eight to ten years ago.  He has no intent to
use these drugs or any others in the future, but has never sought or received any specific counseling
for his drug abuse.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an
individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that could raise a security concern
and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether
to grant or continue an individual's access to classified information.   But the mere presence or
absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  </P>

<P>	Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed
relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</P>

<P>	<STRONG><CENTER>Criterion J:  Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P><STRONG>		A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </STRONG></P>

<P> 	(2) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</P>

<P><STRONG>	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></P>

<P>	None</P>

<P><STRONG><CENTER>Criterion D - Sexual Behavior</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	<STRONG>Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a
personality or emotional disorder, subjects the individual to undue influence or
coercion, or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.<FONT SIZE="-1"><FONT FACE="€€€€€€€€€€"><FONT FACE="Times"><SUP></FONT></FONT></SUP><A HREF="97-0039.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>

</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1">	Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's
willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may
impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	(b)  inhalants and other similar substances.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	<STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	(1)  the drug involvement was not recent;  </FONT></P>

it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue access to classified
information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order
to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to
grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that
to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall
common sense determination, the Administrative Judge may only draw those inferences and
conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><CENTER><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><CENTER><STRONG>Criterion J - Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	The government established its case with regard to criminal conduct, Criterion J.  Applicant
engaged in sexual misconduct from 1993 to July 1995 which culminated in felony sodomy on a
minor child in July 1995 to which Applicant plead guilty.  This conviction for felony sodomy retains
its security significance as he was sentenced to 12 years in prison.  While the court suspended the
sentence for twenty years and put him on supervised probation as long as he met the terms, the court
required continuing counseling as well as requiring him to pay the costs of the victim's counseling. 
Applicant is still on probation and will be for many years to come.  He is still in court-ordered
counseling.  Consequently, he comes within disqualifying condition 2, detailed above.  While his
counselor submitted a supportive letter that Applicant has made many gains to understanding himself
better and made significant changes in his life, this counselor did not provide a current diagnosis or
prognosis.  He simply reported that Applicant no longer uses marijuana and is more stable and more
psychologically and emotionally healthy than at any point in his life.  Applicant submitted no other
evidence of his rehabilitation or of his current good character.   Consequently, I find he cannot
mitigate under Mitigating Factor (5) where there must be "clear evidence of successful
rehabilitation."  The counselor's supportive letter does not meet that standard in light of the recency
of the crime and the seriousness of his felony sexual misconduct when he was in the role of a father
to his girlfriend's teenage daughter.  Consequently, after considering the Adjudicative Process factors
and the F.3 factors, I decide against Applicant under subparagraph 1.a. under Paragraph 1.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1"><CENTER>Criterion D - Sexual Behavior</STRONG></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG></STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1">	The government established its case with regard to sexual behavior, Criterion D, as  Applicant
has not only the felony sodomy conviction, discussed above, but also his admitted additional sexual
fondling of a minor child from 1993 to July 1995 when he was in a parental role with this child. 
This sexual behavior raises a security concern even though he did receive court ordered counseling. 
Indeed, Applicant is required to be in therapy with a psychologist and follow all treatment
recommendations.  Nevertheless, he comes within disqualifying conditions 1 and 3, detailed above. 
He has not yet met conditions<A HREF="97-0039.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> to mitigate this security concern: (1) he was an adult at the time; (2)
the behavior is recent, within the past two years; (3) there is other evidence of questionable judgment
in his drug abuse; (4) there is still potential for the behavior to serve as a basis for undue influence
or coercion as there is no evidence as to how widely this conduct is known so he remains  vulnerable
for it even though his conviction is a matter of public record.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	While his psychologist found Applicant showed remorse for the harm he had done the victim,
I note that at the time he gave a Statement to DIS on May 24, 1996, he still placed the blame for his
conduct in part on the child's mother who gave him "too many opportunities to be alone" with the
child.  Further, he justified his behavior by saying that he saw the 14-year old child as an "equal,
rather than as a child."  As recently as April 9, 1996, his group therapist reported that Applicant
continued to have problems with self disclosure and understanding of sexual arousal; he assessed
Applicant as needing to show more motivation and insight into his behavior and to develop external
controls to prevent himself from being placed in high risk situations.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	To his credit Applicant is still in counseling where he evidently is making significant progress,
but without more evidence of his current diagnosis and prognosis from an expert,  I unable to
mitigate this recent sexual behavior with a minor.  Consequently, after considering the Adjudicative
Process factors and the F.3 factors, I decide against Applicant under subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.
e. under Paragraph 2.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><CENTER><STRONG>Criterion H - Drug Involvement</STRONG></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	The government also established a security concern based on his drug involvement which
included  marijuana use and purchases until spring 1995 as well as dated use of cocaine and "crank." 
Thus, he comes within disqualifying conditions 1 and 3, detailed above.  However, this conduct is
mitigated by (1), (2), and (3), detailed above.  While Applicant has not formally entered a drug
treatment program, he has been in counseling with a therapist over his sexual behavior which has
also addressed his marijuana use.  Based on the favorable reference from his psychologist, I find that
he has demonstrated his intent not to abuse any drugs in the future given his two years abstention
from marijuana use and purchase.  His other drug use was minimal and not recent, so that can also
be mitigated.  While the government also alleged a concern over his use of drugs while he had a
security clearance, they offered no evidence to support this allegation which Applicant did not admit. 
Consequently, after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the F.3 factors, I decide for
Applicant under subparagraphs 3.a. through 3. e. under Paragraph 3.</FONT></P>
