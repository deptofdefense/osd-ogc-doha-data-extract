<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and her first husband had more than $68,800 in financial liabilities discharged in bankruptcy in 1997. Thereafter she divorced her husband, was the primary support for her two children, 
remarried, and accepted legal guardianship of her sister's two children. Since her bankruptcy, she has incurred more than $8,200 in delinquent debt which she has made no effort to resolve. 
Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is denied.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue applicant's eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position. In accordance with Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R (Jan. 1987), as amended (Regulation), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 &para; E3.1.2 (Jan 2. 1992), as amended (Directive), DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 20 June 2006 
detailing the basis for its decision-concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Regulation. Applicant 
answered the SOR in writing on 16 July 2006 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 16 August 2006. With the consent of the parties, I 
convened a hearing on 13 September 2006, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility to occupy an ADP I/II/III position.<A HREF="06-12852.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> DOHA 
received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 20 September 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 43 years old and has worked in an ADP II position for a defense contractor since September 2004. She has worked for the company for six years. The director of the division in which 
she works rates Applicant's duty performance as superior and her coworkers find her to be honest and trustworthy.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and her first husband were married in 1991. They have two children; one is 12 years old and the other is 7. In 1997, Applicant and her husband were granted a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, 
discharging debts totaling more than $68,800. The couple divorced in April 2000, and he was ordered to pay $350 a month in child support. He did not pay until Applicant contacted his military 
supervisor. Since then he has paid the child support. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After her divorce, Applicant ran into financial difficulties trying to support herself and her two boys. She currently has four charged off accounts totaling more than $4,900 (SOR &para;&para; 1.b-1.e) and 
eight accounts in collection totaling more than $3,100 (SOR &para;&para; 1.f, 1.h-1.m). Applicant asserts the $117 debt alleged in &para; 1.g was discharged in her 1997 bankruptcy, but the last activity noted in 
her credit report for that account was in February 1999. Applicant never made any attempt to contact these creditors to establish a settlement or payment plan.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant married her current husband in September 2002. They keep their finances separate. He pays the mortgage on the house, which is in his name, and she pays for the utilities, the food, and 
the medical insurance, and apparently most of the other expenses. She pays her personal bills and he pays his. She is in good standing on her student loan on which she pays $81 a month. She thinks 
her husband makes about $3,600 a month. She believes these debts are hers and not her husband's, as they were incurred before they were married.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 2005, Applicant's sister died. Applicant took over the care of her sister's children. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The children's father pays support of $350 a month. She has legal guardianship over her 17-year-old nephew who is in his last year of high school. He works part-time. Applicant's niece, who is 21 
years old, has a temporary position working for the same defense contractor. She still lives with Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed a Public Trust Position Application (PTPA) on 12 September 2002 by certifying that her answers were "true, complete, and correct" to the best of her knowledge and belief, 
and acknowledging that a knowing and willful false statement could be punished by a fine and/or imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. Question 20 asked if Applicant was then delinquent more 
than 180 days on any loan or financial obligation. Applicant answered "no."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Positions designated as ADP I or ADP II are sensitive positions. DoD 5200.2-R &para;&nbsp;AP10.2.1 (Jan. 1987), as amended. "The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, 
based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security." Regulation &para; C6.1.1.1. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline. DoD contractor 
personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive. Regulation &para; C8.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had liabilities of more than $68,800 discharged in bankruptcy in May 1997 (&para; 1.a); has four charged off accounts totaling more than $4,900 (SOR &para;&para;&nbsp;1.b-1.e) 
and eight accounts in collection totaling more than $3,200 (SOR &para;&para; 1.f-1.m). In her Answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations, except that in &para; 1.g, which she asserted had been discharged 
in bankruptcy.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and 
ability to protect classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations (DC 1) and is unable or unwilling to satisfy her debts (DC 3). She has more than $8,100 in delinquent debt and has made no effort to 
resolve it. Although she claims the debt alleged in &para; 1.g was resolved through bankruptcy, she produced no evidence to support that assertion. The relevant evidence from her credit report shows the 
last activity on the account occurred two years after her other debts were discharged. Therefore, I conclude Applicant is still delinquent on that debt.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant may mitigate financial considerations concerns by establishing the behavior was not recent (MC 1); or, it was an isolated incident (MC 2). Applicant's evidence did not raise MC 1 or 
C 2. The debts still exist, are listed on her credit reports, and were incurred with different creditors over a period of time. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It may be mitigating if the delinquent debts resulted from conditions largely beyond the applicant's control. MC 3. Applicant raised this mitigating concern by testifying about her divorce, her 
difficulty in supporting her sons as a single parent, and her recent acceptance of responsibility for raising her sister's children.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It may also be mitigating if an applicant is able to establish she has received counseling for her financial problems and there are clear indications the problem is being resolved (MC 4) or she 
initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her debts (MC 6). Applicant presented no evidence to suggest she has received counseling, has made any effort to repay 
the debts, or the problem is being resolved in any other manner. All the debts remain unpaid. One account for $50 (&para; 1.l) was referred for collection in October 2004 and is still unsatisfied. 
Applicant failed to establish the applicability of either MC 4 or MC 6 to her case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified material facts on her PTPA by denying that she had any financial obligations that were delinquent more than 180 days. &para; 2.a. In her Answer, 
Applicant denied the allegation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate the applicant may not 
properly safeguard classified information. The deliberate falsification or omission of relevant and material facts from any SCA is a concern and may be disqualifying. DC 2. Information is material 
if it would affect a final agency decision or would impede a thorough and complete investigation of an applicant's background. An applicant's financial situation is a matter that could affect a final 
agency decision on whether to grant a clearance, and her failure to disclose it would impede a thorough investigation of her background.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After carefully listening to her testimony, observing her demeanor, and considering all other evidence in the case, I am not convinced Applicant deliberately falsified the PTPA about her financial 
condition. Therefore, I find for Applicant on &para; 2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant committed a felony by deliberately falsifying her PTPA as alleged in &para; 2.a. Applicant failed to admit or deny the allegation in her Answer.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation or knowingly make or use a false writing in any matter within the 
jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States. 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. As I was not convinced Applicant deliberately falsified her PTPA, I am unable to conclude that she 
violated 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. I find for Applicant on &para; 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Whole Person Analysis</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk." Regulation (app. 8) at&nbsp;132. It 
involves "the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept." <EM>Id.</EM> An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and 
seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity 
at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the 
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. <EM>Id.</EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is intelligent, mature, hard-working, and has the trust of her supervisors and peers. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Her financial situation was clearly exacerbated by her divorce, her attempts to support two children, and her subsequent guardianship over her sister's children. She asserts that she intends to pay 
these debts. Nevertheless, she has done nothing to resolve her debts. She has not made payments or otherwise attempted to resolve her debts. She has not even contacted the creditors or paid off her 
$50 debt. I conclude the likelihood that her debts will be a continuing problem is substantial. I am unable to conclude it is in the interest of national security to grant her eligibility for an ADP I/II/III 
position.<BR> 
</SPAN></P>

2004, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and Security purported to extend the adjudication process to ADP III positions as well. As far as I could determine, the contents 
of this memorandum have never been published in the Federal Register, as appears to be required by 5 U.S.C. &sect; 552(a)(1) before the memorandum could become effective. Nevertheless, I am 
required to follow the directions of the Deputy Under Secretary.</SPAN></P>
