<P>Federally retired Applicant, formerly employed by a military department in the area of foreign military sales, wrongly determined during his federal 
employment that he was authorized to act as an advocate for the contract interests of foreign countries, sometimes in opposition to US contractual positions, 
thus rendering himself vulnerable to exploitation by other governments. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On August 31, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance 
for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted.</P> 
<P>The Applicant responded to the SOR in a written answer dated September 25, 2001, in which he requested a hearing. The case was assigned to the undersigned 
on October 31, 2001. On November 14, 2001, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing on December 18, 2001. (See Transcript No. 1, hereafter 
Tr. 1.)<A HREF="01-10301.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The hearing was concluded on December 19, 2001. (See Transcript No. 2, hereafter Tr. 2.)</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT </SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Applicant is fifty-five years old, and he is a retired Federal civil servant. Prior to his retirement Applicant was employed by the Department of the Army as 
a senior-level director in the area of Foreign Military Sales (FMS)<A HREF="01-10301.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>. While he performed these duties Applicant held a security clearance, but it was suspended 
by the Army in 1996 and thereafter  revoked on August 15, 1997.<A HREF="01-10301.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> As a contractor employee Applicant now seeks a renewed security clearance through DOHA 
in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</P> 
<P>The findings of fact below are generally divided into a discussion of security clearance actions taken by the Army, followed by a discussion of subsequent 
actions taken by DOHA as part of Applicant's current request for a new clearance.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Dept of Army security clearance actions</SPAN> </P> 
<P>In May 1996 unidentified informant(s) reported to Army investigators (CID) their belief that Applicant repeatedly showed bias and favoritism toward the 
Government of Israel (GOI) in his official involvement with Israeli FMS purchases of the Army's widely-sought "Apache" gunship helicopter. Acting upon 
these allegations the Army temporarily suspended Applicant's security clearance and removed him from classified duties pending an investigation.<A HREF="01-10301.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> A CID 
investigative report dated January 28, 1997 found probable cause to believe some of the allegations against the Applicant were true while others were not. (Gov. 
Ex. 4b, p. 4b-5.)<A HREF="01-10301.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>On April 23, 1997 the Army issued to Applicant a letter of Intent to Revoke Security Clearance (LOI, Gov. Ex. 2, p. 2-18) under the provisions of DoD 5200.2-R, applicable to DoD civilian employees. The Army's allegations, selectively drawn from the CID report, are summarized below:</P> 
<P>a. During 1990 to 1995 you received illegal gratuities and gifts from GOI liaison officers.</P> 
<P>b. You acted as an agent of the GOI by challenging the decisions of other FMS personnel in the presence of GOI officials. </P> 
<P>c. While on Army business in Israel you did not report to security personnel your discovery of an electronic listening device located in a GOI vehicle in which 
you were an invited passenger. </P> 
<P>d. You leaned on others in FMS to give favorable treatment to GOI because of your feelings for Israel; you gave investigators conflicting information about the 
listening device; you did not inform Army officials you received GOI gratuities and gifts; and you did not answer investigators' written questions about your 
activities.</P> 
<P> In a letter through his counsel dated July 22, 1997, Applicant denied any wrongful conduct. (Pleadings Folder, tab D.) Applicant addressed the Army's factual 
allegations by providing explanatory information, and his responses, in summary, are set forth below:</P> 
<P>a. My associations with all foreign liaison officers, including Israelis,  were within the scope of my FMS duties, to include occasional exchanges of social 
invitations and minor gratuities.</P> 
<P>b. As part of my duties I sometimes brought together US and foreign parties to reconcile FMS contract differences and to resolve conflicts. </P> 
<P>c. I believed the device in question was an unattached transmitting microphone which was a normal part of GOI radio equipment in the official vehicle.</P> 
<P>d. As a Jew I have a religious and historical affinity for Israel, but it does not affect performance of my professional duties; I provided information about the 
alleged listening device consistent with my best recollection at the time; my actions relative to reporting foreign gifts and gratuities were always in accord with 
existing FMS policies and practices; I provided all information requested by investigators during verbal interviews, and I expected they would furnish a sworn 
statement for me to sign, but they did not.</P> 
<P>The Army considered Applicant's written responses but rejected his explanations and revoked his clearance in a letter dated August 15, 1997 addressed to 
Applicant through his military superior. (Gov. Ex. 2, p. 2-2.) In addition to announcing its decision, the Army's letter explained to Applicant his appeal rights to 
the Army's Personnel Security Appeal Board (PSAB) or alternatively to the DoD Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)<A HREF="01-10301.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>. The letter further 
informed Applicant he must comply with specified timelines if he elected to appeal. The letter contains a "CF" notation at the end with an address indicating a 
copy was furnished to Applicant's counsel.</P> 
<P>Applicant did not file an appeal with either PSAB or DOHA. Both Applicant and his counsel assert now and in the past they did not receive the Army's letter of 
revocation. (Tr. 2, pp. 410-414.) Applicant claims he did not learn of the letter of revocation until March 13, 2000, nearly three years after he retired. (Gov. Ex. 
3, p. 3-11.) </P> 
<P>In resolving the factual issue of Applicant's receipt of the Army's letter of revocation, it is presumed the letter was forwarded to him through established 
mailing and distribution procedures similar to those used for earlier correspondence. It is also presumed Applicant routinely provided the Army an address for 
forwarding future correspondence after he retired. It is further presumed that Applicant's counsel was anticipating the Army's important decision regarding his 
client, and he was alert for its pending arrival. Based upon these logical and reasonable presumptions it is found that, more likely than not, either Applicant or 
his counsel, or both, received a copy of the Army's decision to revoke his clearance.</P> 
<P>Furthermore, it is found that between August 15, 1997 (date of the Army's letter of revocation) and March 13, 2000 (date Applicant claims he first saw the 
letter) neither Applicant nor his counsel made any serious inquiries directly to the Army in a concerted effort to learn the Army's decision, had they not received 
it. Applicant's vague claim of congressional correspondence on this issue is not evidence of a diligent pursuit of his rights. (Tr. 2, pp. 410-414; 445-449.) </P> 
<P>In view of (1) the Army's LOI informing Applicant of its allegations; (2) Applicant's detailed response (3) the Army's reasoned decision; and (4) Applicant's 
receipt of the decision and/or his failure to lodge a timely appeal or inquiry, it is found that Applicant was informed of the Army's security concerns, he 
responded to these concerns, the Army considered his answers but revoked his clearance and notified him, and Applicant failed to appeal the Army's decision.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DOHA security clearance actions</SPAN></P> 
<P>On March 30, 1998, the Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application in connection with his post-retirement employment in the defense sector. (Gov. 
Ex. 1.) On August 31, 2001, as noted above in the Statement of the Case, Applicant was issued an SOR stating why DOHA could not initially conclude that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. </P> 
<P>In reaching factual findings in this case, the Army's prior adjudication is given substantial weight for two reasons. First, the Army's decisions were made 
contemporaneous with events that occurred well over five years ago. This gave Army adjudicators an advantage of perspective, situational awareness and 
familiarity with departmental policies at the time. Second, under the well-established legal doctrine of <EM>res judicata </EM>the Army's prior adjudication is entitled to 
administrative deference, if not full acceptance.</P> 
<P>The SOR is generally divided into the Government's principal allegations, <EM>i.e.</EM>, those four which exactly track the Army's LOI, and the remaining allegations 
which differ from the LOI. In presenting the findings below, DOHA security clearance actions are examined with reference to this division. </P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SOR, Paragraph 1, subparas. a.(1.) through a.(4.).</SPAN> In these subparagraphs of the SOR the Government sets out its principal case, four allegations taken verbatim 
from the Army's LOI. Not surprisingly, Applicant's answers are nearly identical to those he provided in his response to the LOI. (These four allegations and 
Applicant's responses were discussed above as LOI allegations a. through d.)</P> 
<P>At the DOHA hearing, the Government's primary evidence was the CID report, the same evidence relied upon by the Army in the LOI and the decision to 
revoke clearance. For his part, Applicant's evidence does not depart significantly from the evidence he provided the Army. An independent review of the 
hearing record results in no basis to disagree with the Army's ultimate factual determinations, except in one area discussed further below. </P> 
<P>The Applicant's official conduct on-duty resulted in numerous reports of his bias toward GOI liaison officers. Additionally, while off-duty in Israel, Applicant 
shared the private home of a retired Israeli officer whom he first met through FMS activities. He never made such a noticeable gesture of personal friendship 
toward officers from any other country.  (Tr. 2., pp. 438-439.)</P> 
<P>Applicant concedes he acted vigorously on behalf of Israeli FMS customers and others in their aggressive insistence upon full contractual compliance, and 
sometimes more. As a source of his authority, Applicant relies almost exclusively upon one brief line in a blanket charter regulation that simultaneously directs 
his office and ten others "<EM>to ensure customer commitments are kept to ensure customer satisfaction with the FMS process."</EM><A HREF="01-10301.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> (Emphasis supplied.)</P> 
<P>  Within government, powerful management authority over major programs is not customarily set out this way, <EM>i.e.</EM>, through an obscure sentence found in the 
latter portion of a charter document that applies to multiple organizations. Therefore, it is unreasonable to accept Applicant's contention that these few words 
gave him official authority to act as an FMS contract advocate for over fifty foreign nations in a multi-billion dollar program. Regardless of a perceived need for 
the role of an advocate, Applicant's assumption of this power is based upon a serious distortion of his directorate's charter. (For security clearance purposes, 
silence or indifference by Applicant's superiors does not justify his actions.)</P> 
<P>As Applicant explains it, this isolated sentence was his license and authority to speak as a champion of the FMS buyers. At the hearing he testified that with 
regard to buyers from foreign countries he was an "advocate for the country." (Tr. 2, p. 369.) Applicant made it further clear in his testimony that he was 
dedicated to persuading the buyers of his loyalty to their needs. Using the hypothetical example of a Taiwan buyer, he testified that he wanted the Taiwanese to 
know "I'm your guy here. I'm here to see that your program works." (Tr. 2., p. 377.) </P> 
<P>Still referring to the hypothetical Taiwan buyer, Applicant makes clear the extent of his advocacy for foreign nations. He testified if he judged the Army's 
contract performance to be inadequate in his view "I was going to probably beat [an Army official] on the head, and I was going to do it right in front of the 
Taiwanese General so he knew that I cared, and I was going to get his problem fixed." (Tr. 2, p. 377.) </P> 
<P>Nevertheless, Applicant testified persuasively, supported by other witnesses, that any gratuities he received from foreign representatives were nominal tokens of 
good business relations, and he complied with customary FMS reporting procedures. This finding is a departure from one element of the Army's LOI.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SOR, Paragraph 1 (subparas.1.b. and 1.c.) and Paragraphs 2 and 3.</SPAN> The second portion of the SOR relies, for the most part, upon the factual underpinnings of 
the principal allegations previously discussed.</P> 
<P>With regard to subpara. 1.b. the Government presents extracts from two paragraphs of the Army's letter of clearance revocation. As found above, Applicant 
complied with FMS policies regarding the acceptance and reporting of minor gratuities. Except for this departure from the Army's ultimate findings, the 
Government's allegations in subpara. 1.b. are supported. </P> 
<P>With regard to subpara. 1.c., the Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because his retirement became effective on the same day his 
clearance was revoked by the Army, and he never appealed the Army's decision. The timing of these events is probably coincidental. (See footnote 3, supra.) 
Furthermore, the Government presents no evidence to connect these events with the type of disqualifying personal conduct contemplated by Guideline E. </P> 
<P>Finally, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the SOR allege that Applicant is ineligible for clearance under Guidelines C and B of the Directive pertaining to Foreign 
Preference and Foreign Influence. In support of its allegations the Government relies on factual evidence presented under subparas. 1.a. and 1.b. of the SOR. 
Accordingly, the findings entered as to those subparagraphs are incorporated by reference for consideration under Paragraphs 2 and 3. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Summary of findings.</SPAN></P> 
<P>The Government alleges that Applicant wrongfully used his official authority to provide undue assistance to GOI officials involved in the FMS purchase of 
Apache helicopters. Applicant denies these allegations, claiming he merely acted as an evenhanded advocate in trying to assist all FMS purchasers. Upon 
consideration of the factual record it is found that the Government's evidence is sufficient to support the allegations in the SOR, except where noted. As a 
related matter, it is found that Applicant received appropriate due process from the Army, and he failed to exercise his rights of appeal.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"> <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. The guidelines are divided into 
those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an Applicant's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) 
and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual's request for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
<P>The following adjudicative guidelines have application in this case.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct.</SPAN> </P> 
<P>Disqualifying conditions:<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P>1. Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances;</P> 
<P>4. Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities 
which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail.</P> 
<P>Mitigating conditions:</P> 
<P>(None have application.)</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline C - Foreign Preference</SPAN>.<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P>Disqualifying conditions:</P> 
<P>9. Performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting as to serve the interests of another government in preference to the interests of the United 
States.</P> 
<P>Mitigating conditions: </P> 
<P>(None have application.)</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN>.<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P>Disqualifying conditions:<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P>2. Sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists.</P> 
<P>3. Relatives, cohabitants, or associates who are connected with any foreign governments.</P> 
<P>6. Conduct which may make the individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure by a foreign government</P> 
<P>Mitigating conditions: </P> 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>2. Contacts with foreign citizens are the result of official United States Government business.<STRONG> </STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Whole Person Concept</SPAN>.</P> 
<P>In addition to the guidelines above the Directive also provides that under the "whole person concept" the Administrative Judge shall also consider (1) the 
nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and 
recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) 
the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>In the defense industry, classified industrial secrets are entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information at all 
times. The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where reliable information indicates that an Applicant for clearance demonstrates personal 
unreliability, preference for a foreign country, or undue foreign influence. These characteristics, if carried over to a security environment, might result in a loss 
of classified industrial information through Applicant's poor judgment, misplaced loyalty or exploitation by others. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Prior adjudication</SPAN></P> 
<P>As discussed in the above factual findings the Dept of Army, as employer of the Applicant, had proper authority and responsibility to provide Applicant due 
process in the adjudication of his alleged misconduct in security clearance matters. In the exercise of this authority the Army reached a decision to suspend and 
later revoke Applicant's security clearance, and precedent from the DOHA Appeal Board strongly suggests that substantial weight should be afforded the 
Army's decision. (ISCR 96-0525, June 17, 1997.) </P> 
<P>Moreover, the Appeal Board has announced that the doctrine of <EM>res judicata,</EM> the acceptance of prior due process adjudications, may be applied in DOHA cases. 
(ISCR 97-0191, April 28, 1998.) In setting out parameters, the Board states <EM>res judicata </EM>it is not applied as strictly in administrative proceedings as it is in 
judicial proceedings. Therefore, where the strict application of res judicata is not indicated, an independent review of the facts is permissible.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Applicant as advocate for foreign nations</SPAN></P> 
<P>Contrary to Applicant's assertions, the record does not show that the Army reposed in his office the power to act as FMS advocate for the contract interests of 
foreign powers. In the absence of such express authority, Applicant's job is no different from all others in Government. It carries with it a fundamental 
expectation that in FMS contract negotiations the Applicant will not publicly express his personal dissatisfaction with other members or elements of the 
American negotiating team. To do so is harmful to American interests because it reveals (or sometimes creates) a division within the American negotiating 
position which customer nations may try to exploit.</P> 
<P>Applicant's expansive and misguided interpretation of his authority, as expressed throughout the record, allowed him to believe he was officially empowered to 
act as a champion or advocate for foreign buyers. For example, he concluded he was justified in publicly berating an American military officer in front of a 
foreign representative, primarily to reassure the foreigner that, in Applicant's own words, "I'm your guy here."<A HREF="01-10301.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> In this regard Applicant displayed an inflated 
sense of independence from traditional expectations of institutional loyalty. Where Applicant willingly misconstrues an operational regulation to suit his own 
purposes, he might easily do the same with a security reglation.</P> 
<P>Thus, the Applicant's defense contains a major flaw. The Applicant seeks to prove that while  he was an advocate for the interests of Israel he was evenhanded 
in his advocacy and he did the same thing for many other foreign nations. However, the Government's concern for clearance purposes is not merely that 
Applicant chose to act as an FMS advocate for the state of Israel. It is instead that Applicant knowingly and willingly, and without authority, acted as an 
advocate for <EM>any</EM> foreign government, including Israel. When Applicant planted his flag of advocacy in the camp of another country, <EM>any </EM>country, he rendered 
his objective judgment suspect and left himself vulnerable to exploitation and manipulation by a foreign nation.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Application of policies</SPAN>.</P> 
<P>A DOHA decision must examine disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions applicable to each security guideline set forth in the SOR. (<EM>See</EM> Policies, 
above.) Furthermore, the Directive requires that security clearance adjudicators apply the "whole person concept" and make an overall commonsense 
determination when evaluating an Applicant's security eligibility. (Directive, 6.3. and ISCR 00-0030, September 20, 2001.)</P> 
<P>Under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) disqualifying conditions 1 and 4 are considered because reliable, unfavorable information was furnished to Army 
investigators by Applicant's associates, and Applicant's advocacy of foreign interests rendered him vulnerable to exploitation. No mitigating conditions are 
present. It is noted that Applicant has not indicated a renewed security clearance will alter his behavior. </P> 
<P>Under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) it is clear that Applicant willingly served the interests of another government by performing as their advocate in FMS 
contract disputes, thus preventing DoD from maintaining a unified position during negotiations. No mitigating conditions are present. It is noted that 
Applicant's advocacy for foreign powers was ultimately repudiated by the Army, precluding a finding of sanctioned activity by the United States.</P> 
<P>The disqualifying conditions of Guideline B (Foreign Influence) are significant. Despite Applicant's delicate and high profile position as an FMS officer he 
failed to grasp the significance of his developing a strong personal association with a retired GOI representative even to the extent of sharing the official's home 
in Israel. </P> 
<P>Conduct such as this, coupled with Applicant's assertion that he is an advocate for the Government of Israel and other FMS purchasers, makes the Applicant 
vulnerable to foreign exploitation. The official nature of Applicant's contacts do not mitigate his wrongful advocacy for foreign governments. His berating a US 
Army officer in front of a foreign general was a serious display of bad judgment.</P> 
<P>All elements of the DoD "whole person concept" have been considered as well, and the record supports a conclusion that each of the nine elements must be 
resolved against the Applicant. As the record reveals, Applicant publicly expressed his disagreement with officially-sanctioned US positions in a bargaining 
situation with foreign powers; the conduct was frequent and voluntary; and Applicant's age and maturity did not yield the wisdom needed to recognize his 
errors. Although the conduct was not recent Applicant gives no indication that he will change his behavior in the future. In the absence of insight and reform on 
Applicant's part there exists the likelihood he will again act as an advocate for a foreign government while holding a security clearance. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Reform and rehabilitation</SPAN>.</P> 
<P>In DOHA cases the presence of reform and rehabilitation over an acceptable period of time might indicate that an Applicant has developed an appreciation for 
the security significance of his misconduct, and it likely will not recur. As discussed above, Applicant continues to claim that his interpretation of his orders 
was reasonable and he properly acted as an advocate for the interests of foreign buyers. Due to Applicant's unyielding assertion in this regard it can not be said 
that he presently demonstrates reform and rehabilitation sufficient to conclude he will safeguard classified information from release to other nations whose 
interests he feels duty-bound to advocate.</P> 
<P>However, this decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant will never possess the good judgment and reliability needed to justify an 
award of a DoD security clearance. There is little doubt that over the course of Applicant's long career in FMS activities he provided superior service to the 
Army in many capacities. Furthermore he may again be a valuable asset to the Government as a contractor employee in the defense sector. </P> 
<P>To be sure, Applicant erroneously misconstrued his role as an FMS officer in the employ of the Department of Army, wrongly believing he could advocate 
foreign FMS interests while simultaneously promoting the best interests of the United States. Nevertheless, this is an error which, with thought, introspection, 
study and consultation, Applicant might firmly and permanently correct. Should this occur in the future Applicant may then demonstrate the reform and 
rehabilitation necessary to earn the privilege of access to classified information.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Summary of conclusions</SPAN>.</P> 
<P>Upon a review of the entire record, it is concluded that the Government has met its burden of proving that Applicant wrongly assumed authority to act as an 
advocate for the FMS contract interests of numerous allied nations, including the Government of Israel, and his actions as a self-appointed advocate for these 
foreign governments cause doubt as to his reliability in a security environment. Applicant's evidence by way of defense, explanation, mitigation or reform does 
not outweigh or offset the Government's case against him. Accordingly, findings and conclusions of this case are entered against the Applicant, except where 
noted.</P>
