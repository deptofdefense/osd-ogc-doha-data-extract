<P>Applicant mitigated the personal conduct and criminal conduct security concerns raised by his history of criminal conduct and his failure to list one of his 
convictions on his security clearance application.  But as a result of his sentence to four years in jail for possession of marijuana and ten years in jail for 
aggravated assault, he is disqualified from being granted a security clearance absent a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  Clearance is denied.  I do not recommend 
further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 3 March 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="02-30045.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 22 March 2003 and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a 
hearing.  By letter dated 5 August 2003, Applicant's attorney requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was originally assigned to another 
judge who scheduled a hearing for 18 December 2003.  The hearing was canceled due to a conflict with Applicant's counsel's schedule.  The case was assigned 
to me on 13 January 2004 due to circuit rotation.  On 5 April 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 14 April 2004.</P> 
 
<P>The case was delayed because Applicant was terminated from his employment because he did not have a security clearance.  The company agreed to hire him 
back if he were granted a security clearance.  Although he is still awaiting a clearance, the company has since hired him back to perform duties not requiring a 
security clearance.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 49-year-old over-the-road truck driver for a defense contractor.  Ex. 1 at 1; Tr. 20.  He and his wife haul munitions for the military.  Two drivers 
are required to perform these duties.  One drives while the other sleeps.  They are required to check the seals on the trailers every two hours to ensure the 
integrity of the load.  After the attacks on 11 September 2001, the Department of Defense required the drivers to obtain security clearances.  Tr. 82.  Applicant's 
wife has a security clearance, he does not.  A driver without a security clearance is not permitted in the tractor.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1972, but was discharged for "disciplinary problems resulting from unauthorized absences and missing a ship's 
movement."  Ex. 3 at 1.</P> 
 
<P>In January 1975, when he was 19 years old, Applicant was arrested for, charged with, and convicted of larceny under $5.  Answer.  In February 1975, he was 
arrested for simple assault.  The charge was later dismissed.  Answer.  </P> 
 
<P>In October 1975, two police officers went to Applicant's residence and informed him he was the prime suspect in a shotgun murder, and they believed he had 
the shotgun in his residence.  Applicant permitted the officers to search his residence.  They found 14 ounces of marijuana, but no shotgun.  Ex. 12 at 9.  The 
marijuana consisted of several growing plants and other marijuana in baggies.  Tr. 69.  Applicant was indicted for possession of more than four ounces of 
marijuana.  On 17 March 1977, Applicant pled guilty to the offense and was sentenced to confinement for four years.  The sentence was suspended and 
Applicant was placed on probation for four years.  As a result of Applicant satisfactorily fulfilling all conditions of the probation, the judgment of conviction 
was set aside and the indictment dismissed in March 1981.  Ex. 11 at 3.</P> 
 
<P>In February 1982, Applicant was arrested for theft by check ($20-$200).  He was released and the case was dismissed after he made restitution.  Ex. 10 at 3.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was arrested on 19 August 1983 and charged with carrying a prohibited weapon.  On 9 September 1983, he was indicted for intentionally and 
knowingly threatening with immediate bodily injury and with use of a deadly weapon.  Applicant pled guilty to aggravated assault with serious bodily injury in 
September 1985.  His sentence included 10 years incarceration (suspended) and 10 years probation.</P> 
 
<P>While on probation, in June 1986, Applicant was arrested for illegal possession of a controlled substance-amphetamine.  The charge was dismissed on 30 
August 1988.  </P> 
 
<P>On 12 June 1993, a capias (arrest warrant) was issued for Applicant for failure to report to the probation officer and failure to pay court costs, probation fees, 
and restitution as ordered by the court in his sentence resulting from the September 1983 indictment.  Answer.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant completed a security clearance application on 4 January 2002.  Question 24 asked Applicant if he had ever been charged with or convicted of any 
offenses related to alcohol or drugs.  Applicant answered "yes" and listed his arrest for possession of amphetamine .  He failed to list his conviction for 
possession of over four ounces of marijuana.  He did not list the marijuana offense as a felony in response to question 21, either.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant and his wife are well-respected drivers who have compiled an excellent safety record and have won awards for handling loads without any security or 
safety violations.  </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was convicted of larceny in January 1975 (&para; 1.a.), arrested for simple assault in February 1975, convicted of possession 
of marijuana over four ounces, a felony (&para; 1.c.), arrested and charged with theft by check in 1982 (&para; 1.d.), arrested and charged with carrying a prohibited 
weapon (&para; 1.e.), convicted of aggravated assault and sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1985 (&para; 1.f.), charged with illegal possession of amphetamine in 1986 (&para; 
1.g.), named in a capias for failure to report to his probation officer and to pay court costs, probation fees, and restitution (&para; 1.h.), and is disqualified from 
obtaining a security clearance under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 (&para; 1.i.).  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN>. </P> 
 
<P>The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations contained in the SOR.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant has a history of 
criminal allegations being lodged against him (DC E2.A10.1.2.1.), at least two of which were serious offenses (DC E2.A10.1.2.2.).  Appellant had a turbulent 
life until 1986-arrests for assaults, weapons, and drugs over a span of 11 years.  In 1993, he was still having trouble reporting to his probation officer as 
required and paying the costs associated with his previous conviction.  Nevertheless, it is clear from the record that Applicant has turned his life around.  He has 
been gainfully employed and not been in trouble in 11 years.  His criminal behavior was not recent (MC E2.A10.1.3.1.) and there is clear evidence of successful 
rehabilitation (MC E2.A10.1.3.6).  After carefully weighing all of the evidence, as well as the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the adjudicative 
factors in &para; 6.3 of the Directive, I find for Applicant on SOR &para;&para; 1.a.-1.h.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Absent a waiver from the Secretary of Defense, the Department of Defense may not grant or continue a security clearance for any applicant who has been 
sentenced by a U.S. court to confinement for more than one year.  10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  Applicant is subject to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 by virtue of being sentenced to four 
years in confinement for his felony marijuana conviction in 1975 and 10 years in prison for his aggravated assault conviction in 1985.  That statute applies even 
though Applicant did not serve any time in prison for either offense.  ISCR Case No. 01-13566 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2003).  Under the circumstances, I am 
required to find against Applicant on &para; 1.i.  I do not recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant deliberately falsified his SCA by failing to list his 1975 felony conviction for possession of marijuana (&para; 2.a.).  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct 
involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could 
indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that Applicant failed to list his 1975 felony marijuana conviction in answer to 
question 24 on his SCA.  But to be disqualifying, such a failure must have been deliberate.  After reviewing his SCA, and the several offenses he listed, and 
observing his demeanor and listening carefully to his testimony, I am convinced his failure to list the offense was an oversight.  I find for Applicant on &para; 2.a.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
