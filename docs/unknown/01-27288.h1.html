<P>Applicant's recreational abuse of marijuana from October 1992 to May 1997, with additional use in January 2001, after applying for a clearance, is not 
mitigated where Applicant's demonstrated intent to refrain from drug abuse varied directly with his perception of personal risk of adverse consequences. 
However, record does not support allegation of falsification of his previously disclosed drug abuse history on a November 2002 interrogatory. Clearance denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 17 December 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-27288.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 2 
January 2003, Applicant answered the SOR and requested an administrative decision on the record. Applicant did not respond to the Government's File of 
Relevant Material (FORM)--issued 16 July 2003; the record closed 24 August 2003, the day the response was due at DOHA. The case was assigned to me on 
15 September 2003, and I received it the same day to decide if clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted using marijuana about 25 times between October 1992 and January 2002<A HREF="01-27288.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>, LSD once in November 1992, and hallucinogenic mushrooms 
twice in late 1995 (paragraph 1), but denied having falsified his 21 November 2002 interrogatories by misrepresenting his drug use (paragraph 2); accordingly, I 
incorporate the admissions as findings of fact, except that I conclude that Applicant last used marijuana in January 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He has not previously held a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 8 November 1999, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA)(SF-86)(Item 4) on which he truthfully disclosed his illegal drug use to that 
date: marijuana approximately 25 times from October 1992 to June 1998,<A HREF="01-27288.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> hallucinogenic mushrooms twice between October and December 1995, and LSD 
once in November 1992. On 12 January 2001, he executed a sworn statement disclosing that he last used marijuana on 1 January 2001, after partying with 
friends. His stated that he had not used marijuana after graduating from college in 1997 because he feared being caught by a random drug test. He used on New 
Year's Day because his friends were using and he knew his employer--the same employer who nominated him for his clearance and the same employer for 
whom Applicant had a background investigation pending since November 1999--did not administer random drug tests. Nevertheless, Applicant insists that he 
will not use drugs in the future, even though he still associates with people who do use drugs.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 21 November 2002, Applicant executed drug interrogatories proposed to him by DOHA.  The interrogatories refer generally, but not by date, to the 
Applicant's statement to the DSS. In response to a series of questions, Applicant stated that he had not used any illegal drugs and had decided to stop using 
drugs on 1 January 2002 because it was illegal, unhealthy, and would limit his career opportunities. Elsewhere in the interrogatories, Applicant states that 
having a clearance will  open up a variety of opportunities to him.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section 6.3. and in Enclosure 2 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or 
against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as 
the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DRUG INVOLVEMENT (GUIDELINE H)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A8.1.1. The Concern:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> E2.A8.1.1.1. Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug 
abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A8.1.1.2. Drugs are defined as mood and behavior-altering substances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  E2.A8.1.1.2.1. Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or 
cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants and hallucinogens); and</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A8.1.1.2.2. Inhalants and other similar substances,</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A8.1.1.3. Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A8.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A8.1.2.1. Any drug abuse (see above definition);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A8.1.2.2. Illegal drug possession. . .</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A8.1.2.5. . . . Recent drug involvement, especially following the granting of a security clearance, or an expressed intent not to discontinue use, will almost 
invariably result in an unfavorable determination.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">     E2.A8.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A8.1.3.1. The drug involvement was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A8.1.3.2. The drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A8.1.3.3. A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2A5.1.1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Concern</SPAN>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. . . </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2. A5.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts  from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.3. Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and  material matters to an investigator, . . . in connection with a 
personnel security or trustworthiness determination;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the 
applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline H, and the Applicant has not mitigated the conduct. Applicant was a recreational abuser of marijuana 
from approximately October 1992 to 1997. And although he disclosed this drug abuse in his November 1999 clearance application--at which point he was put 
on notice that drug use was against Government policy--he  later used drugs with friends when the opportunity presented itself. This use was inconsistent with 
his later-stated intent to refrain from marijuana use in the future. Further, his past use was without regard to its illegality, his past periods of abstinence are 
directly related to his perception of the likelihood of being caught, and his statement of future intent to refrain is directly related to the career-enhancing affect 
of having a clearance. Yet when he considered the likelihood of being caught low, he freely used drugs with his friends. His use was recent, in that it occurred 
during his background investigation, and neither isolated nor aberrational. Nevertheless, his use of mushrooms in 1995 and his use of LSD in 1992 seems 
experimental at worst and unlikely to recur.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant now vows to refrain from marijuana abuse having "matured," I find that vow neither credible nor sufficient to constitute a demonstrated 
intent to refrain from drug abuse in the future, particularly given the circumstances of Applicant's past use. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H against 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has not established its case under Guideline E. Applicant truthfully disclosed his drug abuse history on his clearance application, and later 
disclosed a more recent use to the DSS. Yet, the Government posits that Applicant's answers to a poorly worded and vague interrogatory--one that apparently 
has not been updated since before DISCR was redesignated DOHA--constitute a deliberate falsification of a drug abuse history that Applicant previously 
disclosed. This is simply not credible.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's explanation that he read the question as calling only for any drug use after the referenced DSS interview is much more credible. Further, his 
statement that he decided to refrain from future drug use in January 2002, does not necessarily imply that he used drugs into January 2002, notwithstanding his 
later admission to the SOR allegation. I resolve Guideline E for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
