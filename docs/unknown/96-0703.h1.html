<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	On 27 September 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary
affirmative finding<A HREF="96-0703.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant. On 5 October 1996, Applicant answered the SOR and requested
an administrative decision on the record. Applicant did not respond to the Government's File of
Relevant Material (FORM)--issued 31 October 1996; the record in this case closed 12
December 1996, the day the response was due at DOHA. The case was originally assigned to a
different administrative judge, but was reassigned to me because of workload considerations on
23 April 1997. I received the case on 23 April 1997 to determine whether clearance should be
granted, continued, denied or revoked.</P>

<P>	The SOR is attached to this Decision and incorporated by reference.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Applicant admitted the factual allegations of the SOR, except for subparagraph 1.a. and
the conclusory allegation of paragraph 2; accordingly, I incorporate Applicant's admissions as
findings of fact.</P>

<P>	Applicant--a 50-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks to retain a secret 
clearance.</P>

<P>	The allegations of the SOR revolve around Applicant's extensive history of alcohol
abuse. Applicant first abused alcohol in approximately 1964 (age 18). From 1964 to
approximately 1980, Applicant drank 12-15 beers 3-4 times a week. He had some alcohol related
incidents during this period: a driving while intoxicated incident (DWI) in February 1974; a
public intoxication (PI) incident in November 1980. From 1980 to July 1996, Applicant reduced
his drinking to 6-8 beers 3-4 times a week, usually on weekends. Still, he continued to have
alcohol related incidents: a PI/disorderly conduct incident in March 1985; a DWI arrest in March
1996 in which he had a blood alcohol level of .245 percent.<A HREF="96-0703.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> From 1989 to August 1995, he was
noted to have alcohol on his breath on occasion while at work. In August 1995, he was
disciplined by his employer for having alcohol under his desk at work. He has been asked to
leave a local bar on several occasions when the bartender believed Applicant had become
intoxicated. As a result of his DWI conviction for the March 1996 arrest, Applicant is on
probation until June 1998.</P>

<P>	Since at least 1985, Applicant has engaged in a pattern of abuse of sick leave and leave
without pay (LWOP) at his place of employment. A 23 September 1985 employee evaluation
(Item 15) notes that while Applicant's work has improved, "he still abuses sick leave." On 16
December 1992, Applicant was formally counseled by his employer for leave abuse over the
prior ten months (Item 14). In May 1996, Applicant's employer noted that Applicant was
generally absent on a Monday or a Friday (Item 12).  In June 1996, Applicant was again formally
counseled by his employer for leave abuse (Item 10). Applicant denies that there is any
connection between his alcohol consumption and his absence from work; the record evidence
does not firmly establish such a connection.<A HREF="96-0703.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	Applicant's employer records reflect that he is a competent employee when he is
available for work. Applicant denies that he has any problem with alcohol.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in
evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account
the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and
circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in
Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a
particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as
the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </P>

<P>	Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most
pertinent to this case:</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION (CRITERION G)</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment,
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of
classified information due to carelessness.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(1) alcohol-related incidents away from work. . .</P>

<P>		(4) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment;</P>

<P>    	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		None.</P>

<P>	<CENTER><STRONG><U>PERSONAL CONDUCT (CRITERION E)</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not
properly safeguard classified information.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(5) a pattern of . . . rule violations;</P>

<P>	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		None.</P>

<P>		</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.
If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to Applicant to establish
her security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to
demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise
doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden
of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under criterion G. The record clearly establishes
many years of alcohol abuse by Applicant. He had alcohol-related arrests in 1974, 1980, 1985, and
1996; he violated his employer's alcohol policy in August 1995; he has been asked to leave a local
bar on several occasions when he became intoxicated. From approximately 1964 to 1980 Applicant
clearly abuse alcohol when he drank 12-15 beers 3-4 nights per week; however, since 1980, even
his reduced level of consumption to 6-8 beers 3-4 nights per week remains alcohol abuse.
Applicant's claim that he does not have an alcohol problem is clearly belied by the record. His
arch 1996 DWI conviction occurred when he had a BAC of .245 percent. He is on probation for
that offense until June 1998. Applicant's discussion of his alcohol history demonstrates that he has
no intent to further reduce his alcohol consumption and has developed no insight into the problems
caused by alcohol consumption. There is no evidence he has ever sought help from AA or an
employee assistance program. I conclude that Applicant is likely to continue to abuse alcohol as he
has in the past. Accordingly, I find criterion G. against Applicant.</P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under criterion E. Although there is no established
connection between Applicant's abuse of sick leave/LWOP and his alcohol abuse, the abuse of leave,
standing alone, casts considerable doubt on Applicant's judgment and reliability. On two occasions
since December 1992, Applicant's employer has had to threaten Applicant with further disciplinary
action if he does not conform to accepted norms of attendance. If Applicant cannot be relied upon
to comply with the most basic employee obligation of regular work attendance, he cannot be relied 
upon to comply with the more rigorous requirements for handling classified information. I find
criterion E. against Applicant.</P>
