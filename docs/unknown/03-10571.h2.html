<P>Applicant was convicted in May 1982 of theft by unlawful taking, a second degree misdemeanor, after he used a BB gun to rob a gas station attendant. 
Applicant was denied a security clearance because of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 and failure to show adequate rehabilitation of his criminal conduct. Applicant appealed, 
and the DOHA Appeal Board remanded the case for reconsideration in light of the October 2004 amendments to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. Since Applicant was 
incarcerated only 15 days, 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 as amended does not bar the grant or renewal of a security clearance to Applicant. Criminal conduct concerns remain 
unmitigated where he shows little appreciation for the seriousness of his past misconduct. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On October 3, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-10571.h2.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> DOHA recommended referral to an administrative judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be 
granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The SOR was based on Criminal Conduct (Guideline J) because of Applicant's 1982 conviction of theft by unlawful 
taking, for which he was sentenced to a term of incarceration from 15 days to 23 &frac12; months. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, Applicant was  alleged to be 
disqualified from having a clearance granted or renewed.</P> 
<P>A hearing was conducted on Applicant's security eligibility on January 15, 2004, with Applicant representing himself. On July 28, 2004, I issued a Decision 
finding it was not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or renew a security clearance for Applicant. Applicant was barred from being granted a 
security clearance under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 absent a meritorious waiver, as he could have served up to 23 &frac12; months in jail for his crime. Doubts also persisted for 
his rehabilitation because he minimized the seriousness of his criminal behavior. Accordingly, an adverse finding was returned as to SOR &para; 1.a. as well.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed this Decision. While his case was pending appeal, 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 was amended on October 28, 2004, to apply to persons sentenced to a 
term of imprisonment of more than one year and incarcerated as a result for not less than one year.<A HREF="03-10571.h2.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> <EM>See</EM> Section 1062, Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2005. On November 8, 2004, the DOHA Appeal Board remanded Applicant's case "to allow the parties an opportunity--consistent with the basic 
principles of due process--to present their views on the effect of Section 1062 on Applicant's case." I was specifically directed to provide Department Counsel 
the opportunity to obtain guidance from the DoD as to the legal effect of Section 1062 on pending cases. The Board also indicated the evidentiary record could 
be reopened on a showing of good cause by either party. ISCR Case No. 03-10571 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2004).</P> 
<P>In this case, the DOHA Appeal Board had before it a question of whether or not to apply the  amendments to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 that had not been in effect at the 
time I rendered my decision. Such an issue is a matter of appellate law which should have been addressed by the Board, especially where the Board did not 
identify error to be corrected.<A HREF="03-10571.h2.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> However, not at liberty to disregard the Board's remand order,<A HREF="03-10571.h2.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> I ordered Department Counsel on November 22, 2004, to apprise 
me and Applicant's counsel by January 5, 2005, of the DoD's position as to the possible retroactive application of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 to Applicant's case. On 
December 14, 2004, the Director, DOHA, placed a moratorium on all actions in any case involving paragraph (1) or (4) of subsection (c)) of that statute. With 
the lifting of the moratorium in August 2005, Department Counsel was given until August 15, 2005, to comply with my order of November 22, 2004.</P> 
<P>On August 8, 2005, Department Counsel indicated the amendments to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 apply retroactively to all pending cases, but it remained the 
government's position that it was not clearly consistent to grant Applicant a security clearance. By order of August 11, 2005, Applicant was granted until 
August 26, 2005, to present his views on the effect of Section 1062 on his case. No response had been received by the due date.</P> 
<P>The DoD's position is consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court's holding in <EM>Lan dgraf v. USI Film Products et al.</EM>, 599 U.S. 244, 280 (1994):</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit, the court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the 
statute's proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to resort to judicial default rules. When, however, the statute contains no such express 
command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, <EM>i.e., </EM>whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, 
increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed. If the statute would operate retroactively, our 
traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Retroactive application does not impair Applicant's rights, increase his liability, or impose new duties. A new decision is warranted considering the 
applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 as amended to Applicant's case. Accordingly, my prior decision of July 28, 2004, is vacated.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 41-year-old married father of four children.<A HREF="03-10571.h2.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> He has been employed by the same defense contractor since June1988. He held a confidential 
security clearance for his engineering duties from 1988 to July 1993, when his clearance was upgraded to the secret level, although he subsequently held a 
position where he did not require the clearance. In November 2002, he submitted a security clearance application to update the clearance that he requires for his 
present position as an engineering manager with direct or second-level supervisory responsibility for 40 engineers.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In Fall 1981, Applicant matriculated in the state university. Raised by a father who emphasized the importance of making it on one's own, Applicant financed 
his education through a combination of student loans and employment at the local YMCA. During the second semester of his freshman year, Applicant did not 
have the funds to cover about $100 in bills after he paid his tuition. Applicant decided to hold up a service station. In February 1982, he pulled into a station and 
had the attendant fill his vehicle, knowing that he did not have the funds to pay for the gas. When the attendant asked him to pay, Applicant pulled a bandana 
over his face, pointed a marksman repeater BB pistol (.177 caliber) at the attendant, and demanded the attendant's wallet. Applicant took the wallet containing 
$102.00 cash and drove off. The station attendant managed to get his vehicle license number, and Applicant was apprehended without incident at the YMCA.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Charged with robbery (a felony), theft by unlawful taking, receiving stolen property, and theft of services, Applicant pleaded guilty in May 1982 to theft by 
unlawful taking, a second degree misdemeanor, and the remaining charges were nolle prossed. In July 1982, Applicant was sentenced to incarceration in the 
county jail for a term of 15 days to 23 &frac12; months, to pay $500.00 plus the costs of prosecution, and ordered to undergo evaluation and treatment in an outpatient 
life coping program on his release. In August 1982, after serving 15 days in jail, Applicant was released on parole under supervised probation for the remainder 
of his sentence. Applicant complied with all the requirements of his parole and was successfully discharged in July 1984.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While on parole,  Applicant returned to college. In December 1982, he married his first wife, and a daughter was born to them in 1983, but the marriage ended 
in divorce in July 1985. In May 1986, he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On earning his degree, Applicant began working for a defense firm. He borrowed $2,000 from his father to relocate and repaid the funds. In June 1988, 
Applicant went to work for his present employer as an entry-level process engineer, and that November was granted a confidential security clearance. Over the 
next fifteen years, he progressed through the ranks with increasing levels of responsibility to his present position as an engineering manager with supervisory 
authority for 40 engineers. In 1993, his security clearance was upgraded to the secret level. In 1994 he received a company leadership award, and in 1998 a 
special award, in appreciation for his outstanding contributions. As a senior development engineer in September 1998, Applicant was nominated by his 
employer for an executive M.B.A. program because of his demonstrated capability to manage and complete many challenging tasks. Selected, he earned the 
degree in April 2001. In January 2004, he was nominated as a candidate for a newly created engineering executive leadership position in the company. As of 
January 2004, Applicant needed three credits to earn his master's in engineering.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Married to his present wife since September 1989, Applicant has a stable lifestyle. He has received speeding tickets, but has not otherwise violated the law. As 
of January 2004, he intended to pursue a possible pardon of his 1982 conviction.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been less than candid with the Department of Defense about his criminal conduct. In an update of his security clearance in November 2001, 
Applicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86). He responded "No" to whether he had ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following adjudicative guideline is most pertinent to an evaluation of Applicant's security suitability:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG>. A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. (E2.A10.1.1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to guideline J:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 1982, Applicant pleaded guilty to one count of theft by unlawful taking, a second degree misdemeanor. While the criminal conduct appears to have been 
isolated, it was also much more serious than indicated by the offense pleaded guilty to. The theft was committed by pointing a .177 caliber marksman repeater 
BB gun at a service station attendant and demanding the station attendant's wallet. By intentionally placing the attendant in fear of immediate serious bodily 
injury, Applicant showed little regard for the well-being of another, and it led to a charge of felony robbery.<A HREF="03-10571.h2.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Although Applicant contends he was sentenced to 
only 15 days in jail with no conditions, the court records indicate with regard to sentencing:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">[I]t is the SENTENCE of this Court that he pay for the benefit of [the county] the sum of Five Hundred ($500.00) Dollars together with Costs of Prosecution, 
that he be incarcerated in the [county jail] for a term the minimum of which shall be Fifteen (15) Days and the maximum of which shall be Twenty-Three and 
One-Half (23 &frac12;) Months, upon release from said incarceration the Defendant shall seek and undergo evaluation and treatment and the Involuntary Outpatient 
Life Coping Program for which he pays the Costs of Fifty ($50.00) Dollars. (Ex. 3)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant served only 15 days, but had he violated the terms of his parole, he could have spent as long as 23 &frac12; months in jail. Disqualifying conditions 
E2.A10.1.2.1. <EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct</EM>, and E2.A10.1.2.2. <EM>A single serious crime</EM>, are clearly pertinent to an evaluation of Applicant's 
security worthiness. 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 as amended is not applicable to Applicant's case since he was incarcerated less than one year for the offense.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's criminal conduct occurred more than 20 years ago when he was only 18 years old. Immaturity certainly was a factor in the offense that cannot be 
ignored (<EM>see</EM> &para; E2.2.1.4.). The dated nature of the offense and the absence of any recurrence are factors in his favor (<EM>see</EM> mitigating conditions E2.A10.1.3.1. <EM>The 
criminal behavior was not recent</EM>, and E2.A10.1.3.2. <EM>The crime was an isolated incident</EM>), but meaningful reform </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">depends in large part on acknowledgment of 
wrongdoing (appropriate expression of remorse and acceptance of responsibility) as well as demonstration of legal compliance for a sufficient period of time to 
guarantee against recurrence.<A HREF="03-10571.h2.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At his hearing, Applicant expressed </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">remorse for the shame he brought on his family, but he also exhibited a troubling tendency to minimize the seriousness of 
his criminal conduct. On direct examination, he expressed a belief that he was jailed only to be made an example of ("And you know, so I believe I was used as 
an example. That's why I was even put in jail in the first place." Tr. 40). When asked on cross examination to describe his behavior of February 1982, 
Applicant initially testified:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I broke into the gas station. I was out of gas and I had no money, And I asked the attendant to pay and go fill it up, and I got, I had a couple of dollars but the bill 
was more than what I could pay. And then he had a wallet full of money sitting there in my face, and the opportunity presented itself, and so I had a toy gun 
beside the seat of my car. (Tr. 54)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As reflected in the robbery charge brought against him, the law regards a BB gun as more than "a toy." While he later indicated it was a BB gun that was 
involved in the commission of the crime, he denied any premeditation, claiming the gun had been in his car since the summer before ("it was just sitting there"), 
and that it was when he saw the money that he decided to steal it. (Tr. 55) While  Applicant eventually acknowledged, albeit reluctantly, that he went to the gas 
station with the intent of holding it up ("There probably was a, an indication to do something like that"), he also testified  he didn't know whether he intended 
to point a gun at somebody (Tr. 55), and claimed to have no recall of covering his face with a bandanna. (Tr. 56) Despite the passage of time since the incident, 
it is simply not credible that he would fail to recall the conduct that led to time spent in jail and considerable embarrassment to himself and his family. Such 
minimization of his misconduct undermines his claim of successful rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has had considerable success in his career as an engineer for the same defense contractor since 1988, and he has a stable lifestyle free of any legal 
violations apart from some speeding tickets. He successfully completed his probation for the offense, and has since become a productive member of his 
community. Mindful that security clearance determinations are not designed to punish applicants for past misconduct but rather involve an assessment of future 
security risk, I am nonetheless unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or renew his security clearance. His very serious 
criminal behavior, albeit now dated, raises very significant security concerns, and his more recent lack of candor with the Department of Defense (failure to 
disclose the 1982 felony robbery charge on his SF 86 and evasive hearing testimony about his conduct in 1982) reflects a lack of reform. Although not alleged 
by the government, the Applicant falsified his November 2002 SF 86 when he responded "NO" to question 21 ("Have you ever been charged with or convicted 
of any felony offense?"). By certifying falsely that his responses were "true, complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge and belief," Applicant 
committed a felony violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.<A HREF="03-10571.h2.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> While an administrative judge cannot base an adverse security clearance decision on conduct not alleged in 
the SOR, it can be considered where: (1) it is relevant and material to evaluating an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; 
(2) to determine whether a particular adjudication guideline condition is applicable to the case; and (3) to evaluate whether an applicant has demonstrated 
success in his rehabilitation. (<EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 94-0875 (App. Bd. November 6, 1995). The evidence before me does not support application of MC 
E2.A10.1.3.6. <EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>. SOR &para; 1.a. is resolved against Applicant, while &para; 1.b. is found for him since 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 
as amended does not apply.</SPAN></P>
