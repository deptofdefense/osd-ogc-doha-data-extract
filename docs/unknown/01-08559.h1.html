<P>Applicant who omitted two prior charges in his SF-86, neither of which resulted in convictions or probative evidence of any criminal conduct on Applicant's 
part, mitigates and refutes the falsification allegations covered in the SOR.  Because his only probative criminal conduct (a 1996 DuI and driving on a 
suspended license) are mitigated by time, isolation and demonstrated overall maturity and responsibility, Applicant's covered criminal conduct is mitigated.  
Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 20, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, 
and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on September 26, 2001, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on December 18, 2001, 
and on January 25, 2002 was scheduled for hearing.  A hearing was convened on February 12, 2002, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of six 
exhibits; Applicant relied on four witnesses (including himself) and two exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on February 20, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 26-year old computer programmer for his defense contractor who seeks to a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is alleged to have falsified his security clearance application (SF-86) by omitting two charges: one in October 1995 for permitting an intoxicated 
driver to operate his vehicle, which became involved in an accident (charge dismissed), and another in June 1999 for assault and battery of a family household 
member (subsequently <EM>nolle prosequi</EM>), subject to a court order of no contact with the victim).  Additionally, Applicant is alleged to have omitted his 1995 and 
1999 charges in a subsequently arranged DSS interview of August 2000, while disclosing his 1996 DuI arrest.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">So, too, Applicant is alleged to have committed criminal conduct by virtue of his 1995 and 1999 charges and his October 1996 arrest for DuI and driving on a 
suspended license, for which he was found guilty of DuI and sentenced to 60 days in jail (suspended).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted his 1995/1999 charges and 1996 arrest/conviction, but denied any attempt to falsify his SF-86.  He claimed to 
have misread the covered question in the SF-86.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following high school graduation (where he was president of his senior class) in 1993, Applicant enlisted in the US Army.  As a 19-year old enlistee, he and his 
platoon sergeant had consumed several beers after work in October 1995, and were readying to embark for home in Applicant's car.  Applicant's sergeant, 
concerned about Applicant's broken leg and possibly excessive alcohol consumption, insisted on driving the car.  Applicant acquiesced, believing the sergeant 
was fit to drive the vehicle.  Later that evening, Applicant was wakened to find his car had overturned.  Investigating police cited Applicant for permitting an 
intoxicated driver to operate his motor vehicle.  Finding insufficient evidence to impute any knowledge to Applicant that his sergeant was in no condition to 
drive, the charges against Applicant were dismissed.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with DuI and driving on a suspended license.  He was found guilty of the DuI offense; the driving on a 
suspended license charge was dismissed.  Applicant was sentenced to 60 days in jail on the DuI charge (suspended).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was again charged with an offense,  in June 1999: this was a charge for assault and battery on a family household member, whose mother, and 
girlfriend of Applicant, turned Applicant in after he reportedly yelled at her and struck her son.  The charges were later <EM>nolle prosequi</EM>, and the competing 
stories of Applicant and his girlfriend are insufficiently probative of any criminal assault or battery to impute any criminal conduct to Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When asked to complete an SF-86 in October 1999, Applicant omitted his 1995 and 1999 charges when responding to question 26 concerning prior offenses 
within the previous seven years: He listed only his 1996 DuI arrest and conviction.  He attributes his omission to misreading the question in its conjunctive 
sense (<EM>viz., </EM>its calling for charges as well as convictions, disjunctively).  Hasty in his looking at the question, he claims to have understood it to call for charges 
leading to convictions: this in the conjunctive sense (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 57-58; 70-71, 79).  Resolution of this raised issue of intent requires a look at the probative 
evidence and demeanor of the Applicant to gauge the sincerity of his claimed misunderstanding.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To a reasonable person, question 26 might appear to be straightforward and unambiguous: Both charges and convictions are inquired about to enable 
government investigators of clearance eligibility to determine possible misdemeanor criminal conduct irrespective of determined outcomes of preferred charges.  
The rationale is that charges are sometimes dismissed or <EM>nolle prosequi</EM> not for lack of merit but for technical reasons.  It is not implausible, though, for a 
person unfamiliar with the form and hurried to mistake the question as one calling for charges leading to convictions, and not the converse.  Motive and overall 
reputation for honesty and trustworthiness do become important considerations to weigh when gauging the sincerity of Applicant's claimed interpretation of 
question 26 of his SF-86.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Both by his high school and military training and demonstrated leadership skills, Applicant  is to be credited with some important early displays of team-oriented trust and reliability (<EM>see</EM> ex. A).  Since joining his current employer, he has impressed government managers familiar with his work ethics and his 
explanations of his omissions on a government form to be reliable and trustworthy in his acceptance and implementation of  established team missions (<EM>see</EM> ex. 
B; R.T., 29-38;  44-49).  Nothing furnished by his family (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 21-25), landlord (<EM>see</EM> ex. B) or government program managers (<EM>see</EM> R.T., <EM>supra</EM>) who 
regularly interface with him provide any hints of disposition for dishonesty or government deception when challenged with choices over the prioritizing of his 
own over the Government's interests.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With this much known about Applicant, it is fair to draw inferences of overall Applicant honesty and trustworthiness apart from what is alleged relative to his 
filling out his SF-86.  Accepting his explanations for omitting his 1995 and 1999 charges when responding to question 26 of his SF-86, Applicant is entitled to 
be believed in his claims that his omissions of his prior 1995 and 1999 charges were the result of a sincere mistake in reading the question, and not derivative of 
any deliberate intent to conceal the charges.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With no clear imputed motive for concealing charges that were either dismissed or <EM>nolle prosequi, </EM>it would take an overly cynical reaction to both Applicant's 
explanations and the corroborating support he engenders from his mother and government managers familiar with his work and demonstrated honesty to find 
him not credible and basically impute knowing and intentional omission of these 1995 and 1999 charges.  Favorable inferences are warranted under th strength 
of Applicant's personal denials and all of the surrounding circumstances of the developed record that Applicant inadvertently omitted his 1995 and 1999 
misdemeanor charges out of a misreading of the scope of question 26 of his SF-86, and not out of any knowing and intentional design to conceal the facts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was first interviewed by a DSS agent (Agent A) in August 2000 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 6; R.T., at 75-76).  Applicant could not remember being asked about his 
1995 and 1999 charges by Agent A in this first interview (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 76-77; 83).  Nor could he recall discussing the charges with the agent.  He remembers 
specifically only his discussion with the agent about his 1996 charges and conviction in this first interview.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several months later (in January 2001), a different DSS agent (Agent B) returned to re-interview Applicant.  Agent B confronted Applicant with his 1995 and 
1999 charges and asked him why he failed to list them in his June 1999 SF-86.  Applicant's response to the agent was essentially unchanged: He misunderstood 
the security form question and didn't know he had to list discarded charges (<EM>see</EM> ex. 6).  His explanations are accepted for the same reasons recited earlier.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is highly regarded by his family, landlord, and government managers familiar with his work and character.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) lists "binding" policy considerations to be made by Judges in the decision making process covering 
DOHA cases. The term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the Judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security 
clearance should</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the Judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In 
addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 
E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in  reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By dint of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance 
and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from 
the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a nexus to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of nexus, however, does not require the 
Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of accessible risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for 
the purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> comes to these proceedings with raised security-significant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">omissions in the security clearance application he completed in October 1999, in addition 
to raised concerns about several claimed alcohol-related charges (only one resulting in a conviction).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  In his October 1999 SF-86, Applicant  omitted any references to his prior alcohol-related charges  in 1995 and 1999, respectively.  By his claims of misreading 
question 26, Applicant places his intent and credibility squarely in issue.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Motivation is key here and provides the all too critical backdrop by which Applicant's omission explanations re: his 1999 SF-86 must be assessed. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Both reason, 
motivation and whole person reliability converge here to demonstrate that Applicant's explanation is both sincere, reasonable and free of any credibility doubts 
about the quality of his falsification denials.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even obvious omissions of material facts (to include non-traffic-related misdemeanor charges and convictions occurring within the previous seven years) may 
be extenuated where circumstances indicate the declarant was under some mistaken impression or understanding when he executed a government form (such as 
an SF-86) or signed off on a deficient signed, sworn statement.  <EM>Cf. Raybourne v. Gulf Atlantic Towing Corp.</EM>, 276 F.2d 90, 92 (4th Cir. 1960).  Both the E.2.2 
factors of the Directive's Change 3 amendments and relevant case authorities underscore the importance of motive and subjective intent considerations in 
gauging knowing and wilful behavior.  <EM>Cf. United States v. Chapin</EM>, 515 F.2d 1274, 1283-84 (DC Cir. 1975); <EM>United States Steinhilber</EM>, 484 F.2d 386, 389-90 
(8th Cir. 1973); <EM>United States v. Diogo</EM>, 320 F.2d 898, 905 (2d Cir. 1963).  Applicant's omissions reveal mistaken impressions, but not deliberate falsification.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having listed his only known conviction (his 1996 offense), Applicant's credible-based misreading of the question may be attributed to his omissions of his 
1995 and 1999 charges (which never resulted in convictions).  His leadership training and skills and the trust he has engendered with his family, colleagues, 
supervisors and interfacing government managers all conduce to provide him reasonable cover for his claiming misunderstandings about the scope of question 
26 of his SF-86.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigation is fully available to Applicant under the facts determined in this record.  He may take protective sanctuary in both MC 1 
(information of falsity unsubstantiated) and MC 5 (individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, 
or duress).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> of the evidence produced in this record and the available guidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E.2.2 factors), favorable 
conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paras. 1.a through 1.b of Guideline E. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because neither of Applicant's 1995 and 1999 charges were pursued to conviction or are otherwise supported by credible evidence of criminal conduct, these 
offenses cannot be fairly imputed to Applicant as criminal activity to be considered as a part of any pattern conduct.  Nor can his SF-86 omissions be 
characterized as criminal in nature, given the favorable inferences drawn on the issue of whether his omissions were made knowingly and wilfully.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Only Applicant's 1996 DuI offense stands as adjudicated conduct that may be rightfully characterized as both criminal and alcohol-related.  To the extent the 
incident covers both DuI and driving on a suspended license charges, it may be considered a multiple offense (even absent a conviction on the suspended 
license charge) and subject to DC 2 (single serious or multiple lesser offenses) of the Adjudicative Guidelines, for criminal conduct.  But the incident remains 
an isolated one and clearly mitigated by Applicant's exhibited maturity and responsibility since its occurrence  over five years ago.  On the strength of the 
evidence presented, Applicant may claim the full mitigation benefits of MC 1 (not recent), MC 2 (isolated) and MC 6 (clear evidence of successful 
rehabilitation).  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraphs 2.a through 2.c of Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E.2.2 of the 
Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.</SPAN></P>
