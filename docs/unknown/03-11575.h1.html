<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant bought and used marijuana weekly from September 1998 to November 2001 and fortnightly from November 2001 to January 2003. He used LSD 
once in January 2003. He </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">falsified his January 2003 clearance application by wilfully concealing this drug history. Clearance denied.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 20 October 2003 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation 
of his clearance because of drug involvement, personal conduct, and criminal conduct<A HREF="03-11575.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. He answered the SOR 13 November 2003, and requested a decision 
without hearing. He did not respond to DOHA's 17 May 2004 File of Relevant Material (FORM). The record closed 19 July 2004, when the response was due. 
DOHA assigned the case to me 19 July 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR, but denied intent to falsify his clearance application. I incorporate his admissions as findings of fact. He is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a 20-year-old electrician employed by a defense contractor since August 2002. He has never applied for a clearance before.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant applied for a clearance in January 2003, he deliberately concealed his extensive drug abuse and drug purchases from September 1998 to 
January 2003. During a Defense Security Service interview in March 2003, he admitted deliberately omitting his drug abuse  because he wanted to conceal it 
from his employer. He claimed he fully intended to disclose his drug abuse during his personal interview. However, while he disclosed his drug history during 
that interview, there is no evidence that he volunteered the information before being questioned or confronted. His answer repeats this stated intent and claims 
he was too embarrassed to disclose his drug history.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant used marijuana weekly from September 1998 to November 2001, spending about $40.00 per week buying "quarter" bags. He mostly used alone, but 
sometimes shared with his friends. He used marijuana fortnightly from November 2001 to January 2003, buying a "quarter" bag every two or three weeks. 
Again, he mostly used alone, but sometimes shared with friends. He spent about $2,000.00 on marijuana over this period. He claims he stopped using marijuana 
after he experienced a bad LSD trip in January 2003, the first and only time he used LSD. He says he intends to remain drug-free.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and 
circumstances presented. Each adjudicative decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the 
Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline 
H (Drug Involvement), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDENS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security 
clearance. The government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it 
establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's case. Because no one 
has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect 
national interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's 
suitability for access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="03-11575.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a Guideline H case and Applicant did not mitigate the conduct. He  bought and abused marijuana regularly from 1998 to 2003.<A HREF="03-11575.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> His 
use is recent.<A HREF="03-11575.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> While he now vows to remain drug free, in part because of the bad LSD trip in January 2003, that vow is neither credible nor sufficient to 
demonstrate intent to refrain from drug abuse in the future, particularly given the circumstances of Applicant's past use. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H 
against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a Guideline E and J </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">case and Applicant did not mitigate the conduct. He deliberately concealed his drug history from the 
government.<A HREF="03-11575.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> His explanation is not credible and I conclude he intended to conceal this information from both the government and  his employer. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This conduct 
violated 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001.<A HREF="03-11575.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> While he disclosed his drug history during his March 2002 interview, he did not disclose the information before then and no 
evidence suggests he voluntarily disclosed the information before questioning or confrontation.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's conduct demonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared personnel. The government has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse 
information about an Applicant before making a clearance decision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information. 
Further, an applicant's willingness to report adverse information about himself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security 
violations or other security concerns in the future, something the government relies on in order to perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of 
classified information. Applicant's conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government interests. I resolve Guideline E and J 
against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
