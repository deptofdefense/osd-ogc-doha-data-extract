<P>Applicant has worked as an installer at a defense contractor since 2001.  He was born in Azerbaijan of native-born United States citizens who currently reside in 
the U.S.  He became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. in 1993.  He currently resides in the U.S. with his Russian-born wife. He and his wife have extended 
family members residing in Russia.  If his family members were threatened by the Russian government, Applicant would disclose any classified information 
asked of him for the sake of his family.  Grave questions and doubts remain as to Applicant's security eligibility and suitability.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant under Executive Order 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (the "Directive").  On August 11, 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision: security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR on August 20, 2004.<A HREF="03-04781.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Department Counsel submitted the government's written case on October 28, 2004.  Department Counsel 
provided a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) to Applicant, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to 
refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions. Applicant received the FORM on November 22, 2004 and did not submit any additional information 
for consideration.  The case was assigned to me on January 21, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted each of the factual allegations contained in the SOR.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor.<A HREF="03-04781.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He has worked there as an installer since February 2001.<A HREF="03-04781.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant, through his wife, has additional extended family members, parents-in-law and a sister-in-law, who are citizens and residents of Russia.<A HREF="03-04781.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  His wife

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On June 19, 2002, Applicant executed a signed, sworn statement which was presented to a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS).<A HREF="03-04781.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In response 
to a hypothetical situation involving threats against his family members in Russia in an attempt to get classified information, he indicated that, if the U.S.

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth Adjudicative Guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the Adjudicative Guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke 
an individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
<P>Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence:</P> 
<P>The Concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.<A HREF="03-04781.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">An administrative judge need not view the Adjudicative Guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in Section E2.2, Adjudicative Process, of the Directive, are intended to assist 
the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial decisions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person" concept, all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The adjudicative process factors which a</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">n 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-04781.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government 
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation, or mitigation 
sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue the applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated on trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  Because of this special relationship, the government must be able 
to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, 
by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions 
are predictive in nature and must often address potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Finally, Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that 
industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this case, the government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has extremely strong loyalty connections with his 
extended family in Russia (Guideline B).  Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation, or mitigation which is 
sufficient to overcome the government case against him. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant, a naturalized U.S. citizen, has at least eleven family members who are citizens and residents of Russia.  The record is silent as to what these people 
do for a living and if any of them have connections to the Russian government, military, or security services.  However, the record is quite clear in terms of 
what the Applicant would do if pressure was brought to bear by the Russian government on his relatives.  The potential for coercion is of particular concern 
where, as here, the Applicant admits that if threats were made against his family members in Russia in an attempt to get classified information, and if the U.S. 
government was unable to resolve the problem, he would disclose any information asked of him for the sake of his extended family members.  Under Guideline 
B, Foreign Influence, the following disqualifying conditions apply to this case: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close 
times of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country<A HREF="03-04781.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> and sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of 
their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress.  </EM>Applicant has an immediate family member, his wife, who is a citizen of Russia 
and lives with him in the United States.  Because of his wife, Applicant has close ties of affection or obligation to his parents-in-law and a sister-in-law, all 
citizens and residents of Russia. He also has ties of affection or obligation to his aunt, an uncle, and six cousins who are citizens and residents of Russia. By his 
own admission, Applicant would divulge classified, sensitive information, if relatives in Russia were threatened, in order to protect their safety.  I find that 
Applicant is a security risk and potentially vulnerable to coercion or pressure through his relatives in Russia.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The evidence in this case does not indicate that Applicant's relatives in Russia, or his spouse,</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">are employees or officers of the Russian government.  There is no evidence indicating that any of his foreign relatives is an "agent of a foreign power.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See </EM>50 
U.S.C.A. &sect; 1801(b).  Thus, the Directive E2.A2.1.3.1. is not appropriate (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, 
daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a 
way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States).  </EM>Applicant admits that he is potentially 
vulnerable to coercion and would disclose any classified, sensitive information asked of him for the sake of his family.  Applicant's loyalty is toward his wife 
and extended family members in Russia, rather than the United States, if he were forced to make such a choice.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I considered all relevant and material facts and circumstances present here, the "whole person" concept, the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, 
and other appropriate factors and guidelines.  I find that Applicant has failed to overcome the case against him and satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion.  
Allegations 1.a. through 1.e. of the SOR are found against Applicant.  It is not clearly consistent wit h the national interest to grant Applicant a security 
clearance.</SPAN></P>
