<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On April 25, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) 
and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)(Directive).  Applicant requested the case be 
decided on the written record.  On March 27, 2006, after considering the record,  Administrative Judge James A. Young denied Applicant's request for a 
security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
<P>Applicant's appeal brief contains no assertion of error on the part of the Administrative Judge.  It consists largely of a restatement of Applicant's view of his 
situation already proffered below.  It also contains statements that constitute new evidence, which the Board cannot consider.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.29.  
Applicant does not request any specific type of relief from the Board in his appeal brief.</P> 
<P>The Appeal Board's authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the Administrative Judge committed harmful error.  
Applicant has not made an allegation of harmful error.  Therefore, the decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is 
AFFIRMED.</P>
