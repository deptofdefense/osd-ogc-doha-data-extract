<P>Applicant failed to mitigate foreign influence security concerns raised by the presence of his mother in Vietnam. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 24 January 2005, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision<A HREF="03-25414.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>-security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive. Applicant 
answered the SOR in writing on 12 February 2005 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 21 July 2005. 
A hearing was originally scheduled on 28 September 2005, but was postponed due to Hurricane Rita. On 2 November 2005, I convened a hearing to consider 
whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 
17 November 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 37-year-old stress engineer for a defense contractor. He was born in Vietnam in 1968, the same year his father, a soldier in the South Vietnamese 
Army, was killed. As a result of his father's service, Applicant was denied educational opportunities by the government after North Vietnam overran the South. </P> 
<P>Applicant escaped Vietnam in 1990 and was sent to a refugee camp in Indonesia. In 1993, he immigrated to the U.S. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 
February 2002. He received his U.S. passport in March 2002. Applicant's sister is also a U.S. citizen residing in the U.S. </P> 
<P>Applicant's mother is a citizen resident of Vietnam. She is 63 years old. She was a teacher before 1975, but quit after the North Vietnamese takeover of South 
Vietnam. She is not treated well by the government. Applicant is sponsoring her for entry into the U.S. Although Applicant originally feared returning to 
Vietnam, he has visited his mother at least once each year since 1999, after relations between the U.S. and Vietnamese governments improved. His last visit 
was in October 2005. He normally stays for two or three weeks at a time. He was permitted entry to Vietnam with his permanent residence "green card" and his 
re-entry card to the U.S. Since he received his U.S. passport, he uses it to travel to Vietnam. When he enters Vietnam, he reports his employment as "worker" or 
"student."</P> 
<P>Applicant and his sister send small amounts of money to their mother in Vietnam because she has no other means of support. Tr. 22. Applicant talks to his 
mother on the telephone at least once a month. </P> 
<P>Vietnam has a poor human rights record and it continues to commit serious abuses. The government continues to deny citizens the right to change their 
government. Ex. 3 at 1. The government is known to open and censor mail, confiscate packages and letters, monitor telephone conversations, and electronic 
mail. The government encourages former citizens to return and at times monitors them carefully. Ex. 3 at 14. Bilateral relations between the U.S. and Vietnam 
have expanded dramatically in recent years. Ex. 4 at 1. </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's mother is a citizen resident of Vietnam (&para; 1.a); he sends his mother $50 a month (&para; 1.b); he is actively working to 
sponsor his mother for entry into the U.S. (&para; 1.c); and he traveled to Vietnam each year from 1999-2003 (&para; 1.d). Applicant admitted each of the allegations, 
except for &para; 1.c. A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or 
obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the 
compromise of classified information. Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence established potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline B</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant has a family member, his mother, who is a citizen 
resident of Vietnam. DC E2.A2.1.2.1. Sponsoring a family member for entry into the U.S. is not a disqualifying condition. Nor is visiting Vietnam on a yearly 
basis. Nevertheless both show the depth of his commitment to his mother.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicants are responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts establishing disqualifying conditions. An applicant "has the 
ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance." Directive &para; E3.1.15.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant may mitigate foreign influence security concerns in several ways. Potentially mitigating conditions in Applicant's case include the following: His 
immediate family members and foreign associates are neither "agents of a foreign power" nor in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the applicant to choose between loyalty to the family member or associate and loyalty to the U.S. (MC E2.A2.1.3.1); Applicant has promptly 
reported to proper authorities all of his contacts with a foreign country (MC E2.A2.1.3.4); and he has no foreign financial interests (MC E2.A2.1.3.5).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In weighing the evidence, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant's security eligibility in terms of the totality of his conduct and circumstances 
under the whole person concept. A piecemeal analysis is inconsistent with the whole person analysis. ISCR Case No. 02-09907, 2004 DOHA LEXIS 642 (App. 
Bd. Mar. 17, 2004); <EM>but see</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005) (evaluating each fact individually and concluding the administrative judge erred 
because the individual fact alone was not determinative). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In assessing whether an associate is in a position to be exploited by a foreign power, it is helpful to consider several factors. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even friendly nations can have 
profound disagreements with the U.S. over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. We know friendly nations have engaged in 
espionage against the U.S., especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. 
Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Nevertheless, the nature of a nation's government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the 
likelihood that an applicant's family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the 
foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct 
intelligence operations against the U.S. <EM>See</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 02-24254, 2004 DOHA LEXIS 703 at *17 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2004) (distinguishing ISCR Case No. 
98-0419 (App. Bd. Apr. 30, 1999) and suggesting it was appropriate for the administrative judge to consider that the foreign country involved had a friendly 
relationship with the United States, is not an authoritarian regime, and is not on the U.S. list of countries sponsoring terrorism); <EM>but see</EM> ISC</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">R Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005) (claiming "nothing in Guideline B indicates or suggests that it is limited to countries that are hostile to the U.S.").</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Vietnam is not on the list of state sponsors of terrorism. Nevertheless, it is controlled by a repressive, authoritarian government with a poor human rights record. 
It exploits both its citizens and visitors.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all of the evidence, under the totality of circumstances, I conclude MC E2.A2.1.2.1 does not apply. The record supports a conclusion that 
Applicant's mother is not an agent of a foreign power. <EM>See</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">50 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 438(6), 1801(b).<A HREF="03-25414.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Whether Applicant is in a vulnerable position concerning his foreign 
associates </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"hinges not on what choice Applicant might make if he is forced to choose between his loyalty to his family and the United States, but rather hinges 
on the concept that applicant should not be placed in a position where he is forced to make such a choice." ISCR Case no. 03-15205 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 
2005). Applicant was unable to establish that his mother is not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force him to choose between 
loyalty to her and loyalty to the U.S. The more dutiful the son, the less chance he has of establishing that his mother living in a foreign country does not make 
him vulnerable to exploitation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC E2.A2.1.3.4 applies, as Applicant has promptly reported to proper authorities all contacts and travels to Vietnam.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all of the evidence, I find against Applicant on &para; 1.a. He failed to mitigate the concern raised by his association with his mother who is a 
citizen resident of Vietnam. I find for Applicant on &para;&para; 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d. Sending $50 a month to his mother is not disqualifying. Neither are his travels to 
Vietnam or his efforts to sponsor his mother into the U.S. But they do reinforce the evidence Applicant has a close relationship with his mother, thus making 
him more vulnerable to exploitation.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>The phrase "agent of a foreign power" is a statutory term of art defined in 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b). It does not include a person who is simply employed by a 
foreign government, unless they are so employed in the U.S., or they are engaged in intelligence gathering or terrorism. The Appeal Board has not discussed the 
applicability of 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b) to DOHA cases. In fact, its interpretation of "agent of a foreign power" seems to be inconsistent with the statutory 
definition. <EM>See </EM> ISCR Case No. 02-24254, 2004 WL 2152747 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2004) (holding an employee of a foreign government need not be employed at 
a high level or in a position involving intelligence, military, or other national security duties to be an agent of a foreign power for purposes of MC 1). Although 
I am convinced 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b) defines "agent of a foreign power" for national security matters, including security clearance decisions, I am required to 
follow the Appeal Board's opinion. ISCR Case No. 03-16516 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 26, 2004).</SPAN></P>
