<P>Applicant has a history of heavy consumption of alcohol.  He was convicted twice of driving after consuming too much alcohol.  After his 1999 conviction, 
Applicant lied to a physician tasked with evaluating him for a court-ordered Antabuse regimen.  Applicant still believes he does not have a drinking problem.  
He failed to mitigate excessive alcohol consumption and personal conduct security concerns.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 16 April 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="02-29739.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 12 May 2004 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was 
assigned to me on 1 December 2004.  On 25 February 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 10 March 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor providing desktop administrative support.  Ex. 1 at 1; Tr. 174.  He retired from the U.S. Army in 
1993 as an E-7 after 24 years of service.  Ex. 1 at 6; Tr. 97.  He has held a security clearance since 1969.  Ex. 1 at 8; Tr. 173.  His coworkers find him to be 
honest, trustworthy, and reliable.</P> 
<P>Applicant started drinking in the Army when he was 19 years old.  About once a month he would get drunk by consuming eight to ten beers.  Ex. 2 at 1-2.  In 
1987, after he left his first wife, his consumption of alcohol increased.  He did a lot of traveling and would drink in his hotel room almost every night.  On the 
weekends, he would get drunk by drinking eight mixed drinks.</P> 
<P>In July 1993, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).  He pled guilty to the lesser charge of driving while ability 
impaired (DWAI) and was sentenced to unsupervised probation for 18 months and ordered to complete a level I alcohol education program and perform 
community service.  His driving privileges were administratively suspended for three months by the state Department of Motor Vehicles.  Answer at 2.  
Nevertheless, Applicant continued his heavy consumption of alcohol until 1995.  In 1994, his second wife, whom he married in 1989, and his youngest 
daughter talked to him about decreasing his drinking.  He still did not think it was a problem, so he made no changes in his drinking habits.  Ex. 2 at 2-4.  </P> 
<P>From 1995 to September 1999, Applicant drank about three times a week with friends.  He would usually drink three to four mixed drinks.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 2.  In 
September 1999, Applicant consumed two or three mixed drinks at home and then three or four more at a party.  He got lost driving home and pulled over and 
started to go to sleep when a police officer knocked on his car window.  Applicant failed the roadside sobriety test and was taken to a hospital for a blood test.  
The test showed a blood-alcohol content of .301%.  Ex. 2 at 1; Ex. 5 at 5.  Applicant was charged with DUI and driving a motor vehicle with an excessive 
alcohol content in his blood.  Applicant pled guilty to DUI.  The court sentenced him to serve 30 days in jail on a work release program, probation for 24 
months during which time he was required to take Antabuse if medically able to do so, perform community service, pay court costs, and attend an AA course 
and complete a level II alcohol education program and receive 86 hours of therapy.  Ex. 5 at 4.  He completed both courses.  </P> 
<P>Disulfiram (Antabuse) is a medication used "to produce aversion to alcohol in the treatment of alcoholism because extremely uncomfortable symptoms occur 
when its administration is followed by ingestion of alcohol."  <EM>Dorland's Pocket Medical Dictionary</EM> 255 (25<SUP>th</SUP> ed., Saunders 1995).  The purpose of requiring 
Applicant to take Antabuse during the two-year probationary period was to inhibit him from taking the first alcoholic drink-it helps people become abstinent 
and establish abstinence.  Tr. 46.  When evaluated for the purpose of starting Antabuse, Applicant deliberately lied to the examining physician that "he was on 
Antabuse in 1984 and was taken off the medication due to intolerance of the side effects."  Ex. 5 at 20.  In a letter to the court, the physician noted the side 
effects described by Applicant were consistent with Antabuse and recommended Applicant not be required to take it because "these side effects could present a 
risk to his safety."  <EM>Id.  </EM>Applicant had never taken Antabuse.  The symptoms he described to the physician he had read about on the Internet.  Applicant 
continued to consume alcohol during the period of his probation.</P> 
<P>Applicant was interviewed by an agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) on 1 May 2001 about his alcohol consumption.  Applicant admitted his two 
alcohol arrests, but did not mention that, in 1999, the court sentenced him to take Antabuse for 24 months.  When the DSS agent went to the courthouse to 
retrieve copies of Applicant's 1999 conviction, she discovered the letter from the physician stating that Applicant had previously had a bad reaction to Antabuse 
and should not be required to take it.  On 30 May 2001, after being confronted by the DSS agent, Applicant completed another statement in which he admitted 
lying to the physician so he would not have to take the Antabuse.</P> 
<P>In response to the SOR, Applicant's attorney referred Applicant for evaluation to a clinical psychologist with considerable experience in the diagnosis and 
treatment of alcohol dependence.  </P> 
<P>The clinical psychologist recommended Applicant have a complete physical to include liver enzyme studies.  Tr. 66.  Applicant did not do so.  The clinical 
psychologist opined that Applicant may have been alcohol dependent in 1999-he was having six drinks each night and had blacked out five times-but was 
definitely an alcohol abuser.  Tr. 77-79; Ex. G at 5.  Applicant's psychological testing  was "clearly not indicative of current alcohol dependence and/or severe 
drinking disorder."  Ex. G at 6.  Nevertheless, based on Applicant's history, the clinical psychologist recommended Applicant become abstinent and seek 
"therapy relative to his style of defensiveness, denial, and generalized coping skills."  Ex. 6 G at 7; <EM>see</EM> Tr. 82.  Applicant continues to drink, although 
apparently not if he is going to drive.  He has not sought the therapy recommended by his clinical psychologist.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G-Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant consumed alcohol at times to excess and the point of intoxication from 1968 until May 2001 (&para; 1.a), was arrested and 
convicted of DUI in 1993 (&para; 1.b), received court-ordered alcohol counseling in 1994 (&para; 1.c), was arrested in 1999 and convicted of DUI with a BAC of .301% 
(&para; 1.d), received alcohol counseling from April 2000 to May 2001 (&para; 1.3), and continued to consume alcohol while on probation, in the counseling program and 
during a period in which he had been ordered to take Antabuse (&para; 1.f).  Applicant denied each of the allegations with explanations that admitted the essential 
facts alleged.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the 
risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A7.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions establish  potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline G</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  Applicant had alcohol-related 
incidents away from work-his DWAI and DUI.  DC E2.A71.2.1.  He was diagnosed as an alcohol abuser by his clinical psychologist.  DC E2.A7.1.2.3.  He is a 
habitual and binge drinker (DC E2.A7.1.2.5) and continues to consume alcohol after being diagnosed as an alcohol abuser (DC E2.A7.1.2.6).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant does not believe he has an alcohol problem despite the evidence to the contrary.  He believes he is in control of his drinking.  But he admitted in his 
treatment evaluations that, at times, he drank more than he intended to, and at other times, he drank with the intent to get drunk.  After his 1999 conviction, he 
told one evaluator that he may have blacked out once between 1971-72, but "could not recall any alcohol related physical problems since that time."  Ex. 5 at 5.  
Yet he admitted to his clinical psychologist that he blacked out five times.  Tr. 78.  Applicant believes the problem with excessive alcohol consumption is that 
he might drive drunk.  He does not seem to understand the security concern raised by excessive alcohol consumption is that it often leads to questionable 
judgment, a failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In mitigation, the alcohol-related incidents do not indicate a pattern.  MC E2.A7.1.3.1.  Although the last alcohol-related incident occurred a number of years 
ago, I am not convinced Applicant's problem is resolved.  Therefore, I have not applied MC E2.A7.1.3.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is mitigating if an Applicant makes positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety.  MC E2.A7.1.3.3.  In this case, I conclude Applicant has not made 
such positive changes.  While he says he has decreased his level of consumption of alcohol, I did not find his testimony about decreasing his drinking to be 
credible.  I find against Applicant on &para; 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant deliberately provided false information to a physician to avoid court-ordered Antabuse treatment for his alcohol 
consumption (&para; 2.a).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant denied the allegation, but admitted misleading the physician about his physical reaction to Antabuse so he would not have to 
take the medication.  Answer.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations could indicate the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions establish potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E.  Applicant deliberately lied to a 
physician and caused the physician to erroneously report to the court that Applicant had previously been taken off of Antabuse "due to intolerance of the side 
effects."  Ex. 5 at 20.  His conduct showed a lack of candor, dishonesty, and an unwillingness to abide by the rules of the court.  Furthermore, Applicant failed 
to disclose this ruse when initially interviewed by the DSS agent.  It is true, as Applicant claims, the court did not order him not to consume alcohol </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">during his 
two-year probation.  But he fully understood the reason the court ordered the Antabuse regimen was to prevent him from taking that first drink.  This is not a 
naive 19 year old.  Applicant was 49 years old and had served over 20 years in the military.  I do not believe that he was too busy, as he claims, or too awed by 
the court to express his concerns about Antabuse and request alternate treatment.  And his statement that he did not like to take pills is controverted by his use 
of vitamins and herbal supplements that were not approved by his physician.  Applicant still does not believe he has an alcohol problem.  I am convinced 
Applicant lied to the physician because he did not believe he had an alcohol problem and wanted to continue drinking.  I further find Applicant deliberately 
misled the DSS agent by failing to tell her about his Antabuse ruse.  He did not correct that misimpression until confronted by the agent with a copy of the 
physician's letter to the court.  I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
