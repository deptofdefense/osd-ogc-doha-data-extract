  It was arbitrary and capricious for the Administrative Judge to not discuss or mention in his decision the hostility of Iran's government toward the United States.  A favorable credibility determination is not a substitute for record evidence and does not relieve the Judge from the obligation to decide what  weight reasonably can be given to the Applicant's testimony in light of the record evidence as a whole.  Judge's application of Foreign Influence Mitigating  Condition 1 is flawed for various reasons.  The evidence that Applicant does not have a preference for Iran does not negate the security concerns raised under  Guideline B.  Favorable decision reversed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated January 16, 2003 which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Administrative 
Judge Claude R. Heiny issued a favorable security clearance decision dated September 12, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel appealed the Administrative Judge's favorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issue is raised on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge articulated a rational basis for his favorable conclusions under Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence).  For the reasons that follow, the Board reverses the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, there is no dispute that: (1) Applicant has a mother and two sisters who live in Iran; and (2) the Iranian government has been deemed to be hostile to 
the United States.<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 
<P>  The sole issue on appeal is whether the Administrative Judge articulated a rational, sustainable basis for his favorable conclusions under 
Guideline B (Foreign Influence), which form the basis for his favorable security clearance decision.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel argues the Administrative Judge's favorable conclusions under Guideline B are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law because: (a) the 
Judge failed to address or take into account the hostility of the Iranian government towards the United States; (b) the Judge failed to articulate a rational basis 
for his conclusion that Applicant's immediate family members in Iran are not vulnerable to influence or pressure from the Iranian government; and (c) the 
Judge misapplied Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 3.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant argues the Administrative Judge's favorable conclusions under Guideline B should be upheld on appeal because: (i) the Judge did not fail to take into 
account the hostility of the Iranian government towards the United States; (ii) the Judge had a rational basis for applying Foreign Influence Mitigating 
Condition 1; and (iii) the Judge had a rational basis for applying Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 3.  Applicant argues, in the alternative, that if the 
Board concludes that the Judge failed to adequately address the issue of Iran's hostility towards the United States, then the Board should remand the case to the 
Judge for "further exposition of the Administrative Judge's factoring in of Iran's hostility to the United States."</P> 
 
<P>For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes the Administrative Judge  failed to articulate a sustainable basis for his favorable conclusions under Guideline 
B (Foreign Influence).</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge failed to articulate a sustainable explanation for applying Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> that takes into account the scope 
of Guideline B (Foreign Influence), the language of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1, and the totality of the record evidence, both favorable and 
unfavorable.<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel correctly notes that the Administrative Judge does not discuss or mention in his decision Iran's hostility toward the United States.<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  The 
Judge's silence on that aspect of the case is problematic.  In general, a Judge is not required to specifically discuss each and every piece of record evidence.  
However, a Judge's findings of fact must be based on the record evidence as a whole, including any evidence that runs contrary to the Judge's findings.<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  
Furthermore, if a Judge does not discuss or even mention a significant aspect of the case that reasonably could be expected to be explicitly taken into account in 
the Judge's decision, then a serious question arises as to whether the Judge forgot that aspect, ignored it, failed to take it into account, dismissed that aspect of 
the case for no apparent reason, failed to understand the significance of that aspect of the case, or engaged in an arbitrary and capricious analysis.<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  In this case, 
the Judge's failure to discuss or even mention the Iranian government's hostility toward the United States (while he discussed various other aspects of the case 
that were not as significant)<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> leaves his analysis under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) strained, incomplete, and indicative of arbitrary and capricious action.<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel correctly notes that the record evidence concerning Applicant's mother and two sisters living in Iran raises security concerns under 
Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and that the burden of persuasion shifted to Applicant to present evidence sufficient to address those security concerns such 
that "it is clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant or continue access to classified information for Applicant.<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  The Judge had to consider the 
totality of Applicant's conduct and circumstances and evaluate whether Applicant had presented sufficient evidence to extenuate or mitigate the security 
concerns raised by his mother and two sisters living in Iran.  Given the clearly consistent with the national interest standard, Applicant had a very heavy burden 
of persuasion to overcome the security concerns raised by the fact that his mother and two sisters live in Iran.</P> 
 
<P>Provisions of the Directive should not be construed in a narrow or artificial manner that does not adequately take into account the compelling interest of the 
United States in protecting and safeguarding classified information and the basic objectives of the industrial security program.<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Consistent with that principle, 
the thirteen Guidelines<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> should not be construed or applied in a narrow or artificial manner that does not adequately address the security concerns implicated 
by  them.<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> 
<P>  Nothing under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) limits its scope to cases involving the risk of influence or pressure exerted by an applicant's 
relatives.<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  Therefore, the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Applicant's mother and two sisters do not pose a security risk does not address the security 
threat that could be posed if the Iranian government were to seek to bring coercive or noncoercive influence or  pressure<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> to bear against Applicant's mother 
and two sisters in Iran in an effort to influence him.<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  The Judge's failure to address that aspect of the case reflects an arbitrary and capricious analysis.</P> 
 
<P>A showing that an applicant's relatives are not agents of a foreign power satisfies only one part of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1.<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> 
<P>  Therefore, the 
Administrative Judge's conclusion that Applicant's mother and two sisters living in Iran are not agents of the Iranian government is not sufficient to warrant 
application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant correctly notes the Administrative Judge found Applicant's testimony to be credible.  However, although a favorable credibility determination 
permits an Administrative Judge to find an applicant's testimony believable, it does not relieve the Judge from the obligation to decide what weight reasonably 
can be given to that testimony in light of the record evidence as a whole.<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  Therefore, the Judge's favorable conclusion about Applicant's credibility is not a 
substitute for record evidence<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> showing that Applicant's ties to his mother and two sisters in Iran do not leave him vulnerable to coercion, pressure or 
influence by the Iranian government.</P> 
 
<P>The record evidence supports the Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions that Applicant has ties with the United States and does not have a preference 
for Iran, but the absence of a foreign preference does not negate the security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Finally, the Administrative Judge's application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 is undercut by his finding that Applicant's mother and two sisters 
would like to come to the United States and the record evidence that Applicant unsuccessfully tried to bring his father (since deceased), his mother, and two 
sisters to the United States, and is still interested in bringing his mother and two sisters to the United States.<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  Given the record evidence in this case, the Judge 
failed to address or take into account the potential leverage over Applicant that the Iranian government could have based on that situation.</P> 
 
<P>The totality of these errors renders the Administrative Judge's reasoning and application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 unsustainable.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge's application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 3<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> also is problematic because it blurs or conflates the difference between 
(a) the frequency of Applicant's contacts with his family members in Iran, and (b) the nature of those contacts.<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  Given the record evidence in this case, the 
Judge reasonably could find that Applicant's contacts with his family members in Iran have been infrequent.  However, given the record evidence in this case, 
the Judge's characterization of those contacts as casual are not sustainable.  There is a rebuttable presumption that contacts between immediate family members 
are not casual.<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  The totality of the record evidence concerning Applicant's contacts with his immediate family members is not sufficient to rebut or overcome 
that presumption.<A HREF="02-02195.a1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>As noted earlier in this decision, Applicant argues, in the alternative, that if the Board concludes that the Administrative Judge failed to adequately address the 
issue of Iran's hostility towards the United States, then the Board should remand the case to the Judge for "further exposition of the Administrative Judge's 
factoring in of Iran's hostility to the United States."  Remand of this case to rectify that error is not warranted because it is not the only error involved.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER>

<P>Department Counsel has met its burden of demonstrating harmful error below.  Pursuant to Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.33.3, the

<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A> "A determination that the immediate family member(s)(spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are 
not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
person(s) involved and the United States" (Directive, Enclosure 2, Item E2.A2.1.3.1). 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A> The application of Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating conditions is not reducible to simple, formula adjudication and requires the exercise 
of sound judgment after careful consideration of the record evidence as a whole and application of Adjudicative Guidelines provisions in a manner compatible 
with their plain meaning and other pertinent provisions of the Directive.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-27371 (February 19, 2003) at pp. 3-4. 
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A> Department Counsel's appeal brief asserts that "[t]he Appeal Board has determined that Iran is hostile to the interests of the United States."  That assertion is 
incorrect.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-00318 (February 25, 2004) at pp. 6-7 (explaining why the same assertion by Department Counsel in another appeal was 
incorrect).  The Board notes Department Counsel's appeal brief in this case was submitted before the Board issued its decision in ISCR Case No. 02-00318.

deciding whether the Administrative Judge acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner, the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does 
not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the 
choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an 
explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion. 
<P><A NAME="N_7_">7. </A> Applicant asks the Board to conclude that the Administrative Judge did not wish to be "belaboring issues not in contention."  It is one thing to belabor an 
uncontroverted matter.  It is another thing to ignore or fail to acknowledge an uncontroverted matter that is significant to the issues in the case. 
<P><A NAME="N_8_">8. </A> On appeal, Applicant cites to a passage in the hearing transcript to support his argument that the Administrative Judge did, in fact, take into account the 
hostility of the Iranian government toward the United States.  The single passage cited by Applicant is not a substitute for the Judge's obligation to address that 
aspect of the case in his decision.
