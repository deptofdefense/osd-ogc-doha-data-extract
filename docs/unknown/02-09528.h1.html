<P>This sixty five year old Applicant was arrested on May 1962, and charged with two counts of forgery. She plead guilty and was sentenced to serve an 
indeterminate term of six months to 14 years incarceration for each count. The provisions of Title 10 U.S.C. 986 apply. Applicant was also arrested and found 
guilty in 1958 for passing checks with insufficient funds, in 1969 she was arrested and  found guilty of  passing checks with insufficient funds, and in 1970 she 
was arrested and  found guilty of receiving stolen property. Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance is denied.   <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I do not recommend further consideration of 
this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On June 4, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated July 7, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. She requested that her case be decided on the written record 
in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Department's written case, which was prepared on September 9, 2003. A complete copy of the file of 
relevant material (FORM) <A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided to the Applicant, and she was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation. Applicant filed no response to the FORM.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on October 27, 2003.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the FORM, Department Counsel offered eight documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 8), which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered no 
documentary evidence into the record. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the SOR. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the SOR, the Government alleges that 
a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The SOR contains five allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e. 
under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline J</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">.  In her response to the SOR, Applicant admits all allegations, except 1.e. to which she does not respond.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The admitted allegations are 
incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">admitted</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and upon due 
consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is 65 years old. She is employed by a defense contractor, and she seeks to retain a DoD security clearance in connection with her employment in the 
defense sector.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant was arrested on May 1962, and charged with two counts of forgery. She plead guilty and was sentenced to serve six months to 14 years incarceration

<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant was arrested on January 1969, and charged with forgery and passing checks with insufficient funds. She was found guilty of  passing checks with 
insufficient funds and was sentenced to serve six months incarceration and three years of probation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant was arrested on April 1970, when she was 31 years of age, and charged with receiving stolen property. She pled guilty and was sentenced to six

<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">that must be carefully</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> considered</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>CRIMINAL CONDUCT (GUIDELINE J</STRONG>)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Concern:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">a. Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">b. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">c. Convictions in a Federal or State court . . . of a crime and sentence to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">g. Potentially disqualifying conditions c. and., above, may not be mitigated unless, where meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretary of Defense . . . has 
granted a waiver.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to guidelines J:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government has established its case under Guideline J. Applicant's conduct, as alleged in SOR 1.c., is criminal and did result in her receiving an 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">indeterminate term of imprisonment from six months to 14 years</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under the provisions of Title 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, a person who has been convicted in a Federal 
or State court, including courts martial, and sentenced to imprisonment to a term exceeding one year, may not be granted or have renewed access to classified 
information.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> I resolve Guideline J against the Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under Guideline J,  I conclude that Disqualifying Conditions a, b, and c apply because Applicant's conduct did involve four criminal offenses, over several 
years, including the one that resulted in the sentence of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">six months to 14 years imprisonment</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. The first  offense occurred when she was 19 years of age, and the 
last when she was 31. Applicant has not offered any evidence to rebut the Government's case regarding her criminal conduct nor has she introduced any 
evidence regarding her current life or employment status. No Mitigating Conditions apply.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P>
