<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On January 26, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 31, 2005, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul 
denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that the security concerns raised under Guideline J had 
not been mitigated.</P> 
<P>Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge should have concluded that the security concerns raised under Guideline J had been mitigated, as a matter of 
law, because Applicant's last criminal incident occurred in 2001 and Applicant has demonstrated he is now rehabilitated.  The Board does not find Applicant's 
arguments persuasive.</P> 
<P>The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them applies to the particular facts of a case.  
Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. 
Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of 
fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  An 
applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to 
demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
<P>In this case, the Administrative Judge made sustainable findings as to a  lengthy and serious history of criminal conduct.  That history involved eight separate 
incidents between 1986 and 2001, including felonious assault, spousal abuse, domestic battery, domestic violence, failure to appear for a bench warrant, and 
vandalism.  Three of these incidents occurred in 2001.  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of 
the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge articulated a rational basis for not favorably 
applying any mitigating conditions in this case, and reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to 
overcome the government's security concerns.  Given the record that was before him, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision is not arbitrary, 
capricious or contrary to law.</P>
