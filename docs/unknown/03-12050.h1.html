<P>Applicant is unable to successfully mitigate the foreign influence security concern due to his close family ties to the People's Republic of China (PRC or 
China), a country that is ruled by an authoritarian government controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. Clearance is denied. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On August 27, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.<A HREF="03-12050.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges a security 
concern under Guideline B for foreign influence. In his Answer, dated September 16, 2004, Applicant admitted the factual allegations and requested a hearing. 
Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed on June 6, 2005, and the case was assigned to me June 13, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on 
July 13, 2005, scheduling the hearing for August 3, 2005. Applicant appeared without counsel and the hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the 
transcript August 17, 2005. Issuing a decision was delayed due to a heavy caseload.  </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following 
findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 46-year-old married man seeking a security clearance for his employment as an architect systems engineer for a large company engaged in 
defense contracting. He submitted his security-clearance application (Exhibit 1) in July 2001. In completing his application, Applicant disclosed he was born in 
China, became a naturalized U.S. citizen, and has family members who are citizens of and residents in China.</P> 
<P>Applicant was born in China in 1959. He attended college at a Chinese university where he studied physics and engineering. Seeking to further his education, 
Applicant eventually obtained permission from Chinese authorities to come to the U.S. for graduate school. When he left China, Applicant's intent was to 
remain in the U.S. He arrived in the U.S. via a student visa and he enrolled in a graduate program in February 1989. He was awarded a master of science degree 
in December 1991, and then enrolled in a Ph.D. program in physics at the same university. In August 1996, he was awarded a Ph.D. in physics. It took him 
several years to earn his Ph.D. because he was working on a research project with NASA. Applicant was allowed to change his immigration status from student 
to resident status, and he became a U.S. citizen through the naturalization process. He took the oath of U.S. citizenship in November 1999, and he obtained a 
U.S. passport in June 2000.  </P> 
<P>Applicant married his first wife, a native of China, in 1989. The marriage took place in China. She came to the U.S. several months after Applicant's arrival, 
but they separated sometime thereafter. The marriage ended in  divorce in 1992. Applicant married his second and current wife, a native of China, in 1993, and 
their marriage took place in China. She was allowed to immigrate to the U.S. some months after the marriage. Since her arrival in the U.S., she has earned a 
master's degree in computer science. She became a U.S. citizen in March 2003 (Exhibit 2). Applicant and his wife own their own home (with a mortgage) and 
have investments in the U.S. Neither Applicant nor his wife has any financial or business interests in China.    </P> 
<P>Applicant's parents are citizens of and residents in China. His father is 78 and his mother is 75. Both are retired and have health problems. Applicant's mother 
has not worked outside the home for more than 30 years. When she did, she worked for a small firm. Applicant's father is retired from his employment with a 
small food processing company. Applicant has regular contact with his parents by telephone. Their conversations typically involve Applicant inquiring about 
his parent's health and other normal family matters. He is careful not to discuss the nature or details of his employment. He provides financial assistance to his 
parents at the rate of about $1,500 to $2,000 annually. Since coming to the U.S. in 1989, Applicant has traveled to China twice in 1993 and 2000. The purpose 
of both trips was to visit his parents. He intends to travel to China in the future for the same purpose. </P> 
<P>Applicant has two brothers. His elder brother and family live in Australia and have become citizens of that country. His younger brother is a citizen of and 
resident in China, and Applicant's parents reside with the younger brother. The younger brother is self-employed in the design business and has a few 
employees working for him. </P> 
<P>By his marriage, Applicant has family members who are citizens of and residents in China. His mother-in-law is about 75 years old and is retired from her 
employment with a university. His brother-in-law is employed by an international firm doing business in China. His sister-in-law is a librarian at a university. 
Applicant's describes his wife's relationship with his mother as a caring and dutiful daughter who is concerned about her mother's health and life. Likewise, 
she is close to her sister and brother, but that closeness has lessened somewhat due to geographical separation. </P> 
<P>Applicant's character witnesses, in person or in writing, describe Applicant in very favorable terms. A company vice president describes Applicant as "a master 
in engineering, an able employee, a hard worker, and a talented researcher" (Exhibit B). The vice president, a retired Marine Corps officer, views Applicant as 
completely trustworthy and suitable for access to classified information. Applicant's current manager, a retired Navy officer, fully supports Applicant's 
application for a security clearance and has seen nothing in her working relationship with Applicant to question his fitness for a security clearance. Indeed, 
Applicant has earned her full trust and confidence in his ability to support the company's Defense Department customers in a classified environment.</P> 
<P>Applicant describes himself as fully committed to the U.S., its Constitution, and its government. Since immigrating to the U.S., Applicant points out he has 
become a Christian. Also, he points out he is very much opposed to communism, and as a graduate student he led various demonstrations against the Chinese 
government in the wake of the Chinese authorities' brutal suppression of demonstrators at Tiananmen in June 1989. </P> 
<P>As requested by Department Counsel, I took administrative or official notice of certain matters about China and the nature of its government as set forth in 
Exhibits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.   </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on 
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree of 
trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a 
determination of an applicant's loyalty.<A HREF="03-12050.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for 
granting a clearance. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-12050.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> There is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="03-12050.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted 
facts.<A HREF="03-12050.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="03-12050.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> The DOHA Appeal 
Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence standard.<A HREF="03-12050.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than 
a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-12050.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden, an applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-12050.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance 
decision.<A HREF="03-12050.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="03-12050.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline B, a security concern may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, common sense suggests that the stronger the ties of affection or obligation, 
the more vulnerable a person is to being manipulated if the relative, cohabitant, or close associate is brought under control or used as a hostage by a foreign 
intelligence or security service.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, the government established its case under Guideline B, because Applicant has close and ongoing family ties to China. He has immediate family members 
who are citizens of and residents of China, as does his spouse. The strength of the family ties is also demonstrated by Applicant's travel to China to visit his 
family members as well as the financial support he provides his parents. Although these circumstances are completely legal and honorable, these circumstances 
raise a security concern under DC 1.<A HREF="03-12050.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> The remaining DC do not apply based on the facts and circumstances here.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline B and conclude that only MC 5<A HREF="03-12050.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> applies. Applicant receives some credit under MC 5 because neither he 
nor his wife has business or financial interests in China. The remaining MC do not apply based on the facts and circumstances here. In particular, I gave 
consideration to MC 1,<A HREF="03-12050.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> but it does not apply. It appears none of the family members are agents of the Chinese government or any other foreign power.<A HREF="03-12050.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> But 
that does not end the analysis, as Applicant must show his family members (including his in-laws) in China are not in position to be exploited. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In deciding if an applicant has met the second prong of MC 1, it is proper to consider how the foreign country at issue is governed. The focus is not the country 
or its people, but its rulers and the nature of the government they impose. This approach recognizes it is nonsensical to treat North Korea as if it were Norway. 
Here, we know China is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party is the paramount source of power (Exhibit 8 at p. 1), although that power 
is diluted somewhat by China's huge population, geographic vastness, and social diversity (Exhibit 7 at p. 6). We know that current China-U.S. relations are 
complex and at times difficult (for example, when a Chinese fighter collided with a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft in 2001), but cooperation does occur on some 
issues (Exhibit 3). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We also know </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">China has made efforts to acquire U.S. technology for military purposes (Exhibit 6). And we know that the PRC's record of 
human rights, according to a 2004 report from the U.S. State Department, remains poor and the government continues to commit numerous and serious abuses 
(Exhibit 8 at p. 1). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Given these facts and circumstances, which are beyond his control, Applicant's immediate family members and in-laws who remain in China are in a position 
where there is a potential for them to be exploited in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to the family members and the interests of the 
U.S. In other words, this is not a case where Applicant's connections or ties to China are minimal,  <EM>pro forma</EM>, or insignificant, because the record evidence 
demonstrates he has close and ongoing family ties to China. Therefore, I conclude Applicant is unable to successfully mitigate the foreign influence security 
concern. Accordingly, Guideline B is decided against Applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although I decided this case against Applicant, t</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">his decision should not be construed as an indictment of his loyalty and patriotism to the U.S., as those matters 
are not at issue. Instead, the clearly-consistent standard--which is a demanding standard-- requires I resolve any doubt against Applicant, and his close family 
ties to China, an authoritarian state controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, creates such doubt. To conclude, Applicant has failed to meet his ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching my decision, I considered the record evidence as a whole, the whole-person concept, 
the clearly-consistent standard, and the appropriate factors and guidelines in the Directive.</SPAN></P>
