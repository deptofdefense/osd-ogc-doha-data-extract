<!--  
  The federal government is not required to wait until an applicant is put in a position of having to choose between his foreign relatives and the United States to determine that a security risk is present.  Applicant's vulnerability to possible foreign influence is the same  whether or not the Iranian government has sought to exercise such influence in the past.  There is no record evidence supporting the  Administrative Judge's conclusion that the Iranian government is not likely to target Applicant in the future.  The totality of the record  evidence in this case concerning Applicant's ties to his mother and three siblings in Iran does not support the Judge's conclusion that those  family ties do not place Applicant in a position of vulnerability under Guideline B.  Favorable decision reversed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated December 31, 2003, which 
stated the reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline B 
(Foreign Influence).  Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard issued a favorable security clearance decision, dated August 26, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel appealed the Administrative Judge's favorable decision.  The Appeal Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 
10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issue has been raised on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge committed reversible error when he applied Mitigating 
Condition 1 of Guideline B and concluded that Applicant's immediate family members in Iran were not in a position to be exploited by a 
foreign power in a way that could force Applicant to choose between his loyalty to those family members and the United States.  For the 
reasons that follow, the Board reverses the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine 
whether there is factual or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with 
specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with 
specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or 
capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or 
conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant 
evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the 
choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it 
offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere 
difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).</P> 
 
<P>In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security 
clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 
(Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of 
fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary 
evidence in the same record.  In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the 
Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is 
record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence 
supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a 
Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on 
appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at 
pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  
<EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge committed reversible error when he applied Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="03-15205.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> of Guideline B and concluded that 
Applicant's immediate family members in Iran were not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force Applicant 
to choose between his loyalty to those family members and the United States</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge found that Applicant's mother and 
three of his siblings are citizens of and reside in Iran.  The Judge acknowledged Iran's dismal human rights record and its hostility to the 
United States.  Nonetheless, the Judge concluded that Applicant's relatives were not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way 
that could force Applicant to choose between his loyalty to the relatives and his loyalty to the United States.  The Judge based this conclusion 
in large part on his finding that Applicant's relatives have not previously been exploited by the Iranian government. In support of his 
conclusion the Judge also articulated other factors such as the frequency of contact with the relatives, the relatives' lack of dependency on 
Applicant for support, the Applicant's refusal to travel to Iran, and the Applicant's meticulous work habits and practice of strictly following 
the rules relating to his work.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel is not required to present evidence that Applicant would compromise classified information if the Iranian government 
made threats against his family members living in  Iran.  Indeed, the Government need not wait until an applicant is put in a position of having 
to choose between his relatives and the United States to determine that a security risk is present. <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (October 
16, 2002) at p. 10.  Department Counsel correctly points out that Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 hinges not on what choice 
Applicant might make if he is forced to choose between his loyalty to his family and the United States, but rather hinges on the concept that 
Applicant should not be placed in a position where he is forced to make such a choice.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel argues that the fact that Applicant's relatives have no history of being exploited by the Iranian government does not 
mean that they are in any less of a position to be exploited in the future.  Department Counsel's argument has merit.  Applicant's vulnerability 
to possible foreign influence through his relatives in Iran is the same, whether or not the Iranian government has sought to exert such 
influence or pressure in the past.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 03-16516 (November 26, 2004) at p. 7.  The Administrative Judge's conclusion 
that the Iranian government is not likely to target Applicant in the future has no basis in the record evidence in this case.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel argues that Applicant's testimony regarding other factors in the case, such as frequency of contact between Applicant 
and his relatives, the lack of the relatives' dependency upon Applicant for support, and Applicant's refusal to travel to Iran fails to make an 
adequate showing that his family ties to Iran do not pose a security risk.  The Board agrees.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, given the record evidence of Iran's hostility to the United States as well as Iran's demonstrated inclination to do whatever it feels 
is necessary to advance its interests without regard to the rights of any individual, the Administrative Judge could not reasonably conclude 
from the evidence presented that Applicant's family members in Iran were not in a position to be exploited in such a way that Applicant may 
have to choose between loyalty to them or to the United States.<A HREF="03-15205.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the 
applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.  
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15.  Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with 
national security will be resolved in favor of national security.  Directive, Adjudicative Guidelines, Item E2.2.2.  In cases such as this, where 
the issue involves the potential of a hostile foreign power exploiting the family ties between an applicant and his family members, an 
applicant has a very heavy burden to show that his family ties with relatives in the foreign power do not pose a security risk. <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 01-26893 (October 16, 2002) at p. 8.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Given the totality of the facts and circumstances in this case, as cited by Department Counsel on appeal, the Administrative Judge's 
conclusion that Applicant met his burden of showing that his relatives in Iran do not place Applicant in a position where he might have to 
choose between his loyalty to them and the United States is not supported by the record.</SPAN></P>
