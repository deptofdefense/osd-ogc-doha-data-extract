</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant admits to the illegal use of marijuana while on a winter camping trip in December 2003.  The Government did not meet its burden of proof regarding 
an alleged use of marijuana in the fall of 2005. The marijuana use was minimal and not recent. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised under the 
drug involvement concern. Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 28, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="06-11055.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement; and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.</P> 
 
<P>On September 13, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  Applicant elected to have his case decided on the written record. Department Counsel 
submitted the government's file of relevant material (FORM) on December 19, 2006. The FORM was mailed to Applicant on December 21, 2006, and 
received on January 2, 2007. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant 
did not respond.  The case was assigned to me on February 28, 2007.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In his response to the SOR, Applicant denies all of the allegations in the SOR.  As to the allegation in SOR &para; 1.a, he admits to using marijuana in December 
2003 but denies using marijuana in fall 2005.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's social security number was incorrect on the SOR.  The SOR has been amended to reflect his correct social security number.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel submitted Item 7, Report of Investigation, Personal Subject Interview, as part of the documentary evidence to support allegations in the 
SOR. This document is an unsworn, unsigned summary of the interview OPM conducted with Applicant on February 21, 2006.  Enclosure 3 of the Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, &para; E.3.1.20, states in part: "Official records or evidence compiled or created in the regular course of business, <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">other than DoD 
personnel background reports of investigation (ROI)</SPAN></STRONG>, may be received and considered by the Administrative Judge without authenticating witnesses &hellip; " 
(<EM>emphasis added</EM>). It goes on to say "An ROI may be received <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">with</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> an authenticating witness provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of 
Evidence" (<EM>emphasis added</EM>). </P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel claims the Report of Investigation is reliable, relevant and admissible citing ISCR Case No. 95-0817 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 1997) and FRE 
803(6) and FRE 803(8) in support of his position. In ISCR Case No. 95-0817, the Appeal Board considered "<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">the Certified Results of Interview</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>", which were 
admissions by the Applicant made to a Defense Investigative Service investigator to be admissible under Paragraph 22 and under the Federal Rules of Evidence 
(FRE) 803 "Hearsay Exceptions: Availability of Declarant Immaterial". Paragraph 22 specifically deals with adverse statements made against Applicant by third 
parties. That situation is not applicable in this case. FRE 803 (6), permits various types of documents to be admitted into evidence provided they were " &hellip; 
made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and 
if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">all as shown by the testimony of the 
custodian or other qualified witness, or by certification that complies with Rule 902 (11), Rule 902 (12)</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> &hellip;" (<EM>emphasis added</EM>). The ROI offered by the 
Government is not a Certified Results of Interview. It is an unsworn  summary of a personal subject interview conducted by an unknown person. It is not 
signed by the interviewer nor interviewee, nor authenticated by an appropriate witness. It does not comply with FRE 902(11), which requires the document to 
be certified by the custodian or other person authorized to make the certification.  It is also not clear who prepared the ROI and when the ROI was prepared 
which raises further questions of reliability.  </P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel has not offered any rule that states authentication of personal interview statements are not required when the Applicant elects a decision 
on the written record. It was within the Government's discretion to request a hearing which would have circumvented the evidentiary issues raised here.<A HREF="06-11055.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> They 
chose not to do so and should not be permitted to use in a FORM what they could not in a hearing without authentication. I will not consider Item 7 due to its 
unreliability, inadmissibility under &para; E3.1.20, and in the interest of fairness. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 49- year- old employee of a defense contractor. He has been employed by the same company since April 1993.  He submitted security clearance 
applications on February 4, 2005, and October 21, 2004.<A HREF="06-11055.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> On both security clearance applications, Applicant indicated in response to question 27 that he used 
illegal drugs within the past 7 years prior to the date of the application. Specifically, he indicated that he used Marijuana on one occasion in December 2003.<A HREF="06-11055.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals sent Applicant interrogatories. Question 1 asked "Have you used <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">any</SPAN> narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen 
(to include LSD or PCP) and/or <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">any</SPAN>, Cannabis (to include marijuana and hashish), except prescribed by a licensed physician?"  Applicant answered "yes" and 
indicated that he had used marijuana one or two times over a period of 10 years.  The average quantity was less than a joint. He indicated the date he last used 
was December 2003. He indicates it was not a habitual habit.<A HREF="06-11055.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>The SOR alleges Applicant's last use of marijuana was in the fall 2005.  In his response to the SOR, Applicant denies that he used marijuana in the Fall 2005.  
He believes the OPM agent who interviewed him misinterpreted one of his answers. The last time he used marijuana was in December 2003. Since December 
2003, he has not been near marijuana. He does not intend to use marijuana in the future. He is dedicated to his job, his country, his friends and family.  There is 
no way he would falsify any statements because he understands the importance of the background investigation.<A HREF="06-11055.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> </P>

issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline H - Drug Involvement</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's past history of illegal drug use raises a security concern. He used marijuana approximately two times over a ten year period with the last use 
occurring in December 2003. Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1 (<EM>Any drug abuse</EM>)<EM> </EM>applies due to his past illegal use of 
marijuana. </P> 
 
<P>The drug involvement concern can be mitigated. I find Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) E2.A8.1.3.1 (<EM>The drug involvement was not recent</EM>) 
applies. In December 2003, Applicant used marijuana.  There is no reliable evidence to suggest that he used marijuana since that time.  More than three years 
have passed since his last use, therefore, his drug involvement is not recent. </P> 
 
<P>DI MC E2.A8.1.3.2 (<EM>The drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event</EM>) cannot be applied since Applicant has used marijuana on at least one 
additional occasion prior to December 2003.  It is noted that the prior use was remote in time and Applicant's total use of marijuana in the last ten years is less 
than a joint. The evidence indicates his marijuana use was minimal.</P> 
 
<P>DI MC E2.A8.1.3.3 (<EM>A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future</EM>) applies. Applicant does not intend to use marijuana in the future and there is 
no reliable evidence indicating that he used marijuana since December 2003.  </P> 
 
<P>DI MC E2.A8.1.3.4 (<EM>Satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without 
recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional</EM>) is not applicable.  It is not relevant to facts of this case. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised under Drug Involvement.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>The government has not established a prima facie case under the personal conduct concern. There is no reliable and admissible evidence in the file to support 
the allegation that Applicant used marijuana while possessing a security clearance. There is no reliable and admissible evidence that supports the allegation that 
Applicant falsified his response to Question 1 on the DOHA Interrogatories when he stated that he last used marijuana in December 2003. This answer is 
consistent with the answers provided on his two security clearance applications. I find for Applicant under Guideline E.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>I considered all the evidence provided and also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our 
national interests. I find Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by the drug involvement concern. He has a favorable 14 year employment history 
with his employer.  While it was not the best judgment to use marijuana in December 2003, the use was minimal and Applicant has not used since that time. 
Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security 
clearance.</P>
