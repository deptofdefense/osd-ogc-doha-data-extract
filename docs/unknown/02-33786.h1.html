<P>Applicant has abused alcohol for nearly 30 years. He has been convicted of driving under the influence three times since 1997, and lost a security clearance in 
2002 because of his alcohol-related conduct. He continues to drink despite being diagnosed as an alcohol abuser and being told to abstain from drinking. He has 
failed to provide any information to mitigate the resulting security concerns about his alcohol consumption and related criminal conduct. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On March 12, 2004, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant 
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns about his criminal and personal conduct, and about his alcohol consumption. The SOR 
informed him DOHA adjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding, based on available information, it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>On March 31, 2004, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer), admitted all of the allegations therein,<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and requested a determination without a hearing. On 
June 17, 2004, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant materials (FORM) with ten exhibits (Items 1 - 10) attached in support of the 
government's preliminary decision. Applicant received a copy of the FORM on June 25, 2004, and was allowed 30 days to respond. However, he did not timely 
submit any further information and the case was assigned to me on August 13, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as facts. A<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 46-year-old principal engineer who requires a security clearance in connection with his employment with a defense contractor. He divorced his 
wife of four years in 1994,<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and has been treated for depression in connection with his divorce.<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> He previously held a Q-clearance through his employment as a 
technical staff member at a government-owned/contractor-operated (GOCO) facility supporting Department of Energy work. That access was suspended in 
February 2002 after Applicant was arrested a second time for due to adverse alcohol-related behavior. (SOR 1.h) Applicant went to work for his current 
employer in March 2002 after it was suggested by his GOCO employer that he would have difficulty getting his Q-clearance back.<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began drinking while still in high school. From 1974 through 1976, he drank infrequently and moderately. While in college, beginning around 1978, 
Applicant would drink as many as eight beers twice monthly. In 1984, he went to work for the aforementioned GOCO. From 1985 through November 1997, 
Applicant would go out with co-workers on Friday nights and have four or five beers each time. He estimates he would have as many as 10 beers four times a 
year, but did not think he was intoxicated even though he was hung over the next day.<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 23, 1997, Appellant and a co-worker went to dinner, then to a casino and a pool hall after work. Applicant eventually drank between 11 and 13 
beers before trying to drive home. When he was pulled over, a breathalyser showed his blood alcohol content (BAC) to be .20%. Applicant was charged with 
aggravated driving under the influence (DUI) and spent the night in jail. He eventually pled guilty to a lesser charge of simple DUI, received a 5-day suspended 
jail sentence, and was ordered  to attend an alcohol education program for first offenders. (SOR 1.b)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In early 1998, while his November 1997 DUI arrest was being processed through the judicial system, Applicant sought counseling from his company's 
employee assistance program (EAP) on the recommendation of his security manager who thought it might help his legal and his security clearance situations.<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> 
EAP counseling continued until his departure from the company in early 2002. Initially, the counseling addressed Applicant's drinking but also focused on the 
recent breakup of his marriage and his treatment for depression. No diagnosis relative to alcohol use was provided until December 2000, when Applicant was 
referred to an outside alcohol treatment facility. He was diagnosed by a licensed drug and alcohol abuse counselor as an alcohol abuser and it was recommended 
he abstain from further alcohol use. As long as he abstained, his prognosis was good. A psychiatrist who evaluated Applicant in April 2001 also diagnosed 
Applicant as an alcohol abuser.  (SOR 1.c) On August 23, 2001 Applicant signed a Recovery Agreement with EAP wherein he promised to abstain from 
alcohol, to submit to random urinalysis, to consult with an EAP-assigned counselor at least monthly, and to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant stopped drinking from about January 1998 through August 1998. He resumed drinking around August 1998, and, until October 2000, he would 
consume a six-pack of beer twice monthly. Despite this level of consumption, he insists he was not drunk after the November 1997 arrest until his second arrest 
for DUI on October 6, 2000. Applicant had gone out to celebrate his recent work promotion. Applicant drank more than 10 beers and was found to have a .11% 
BAC. Applicant eventually pled guilty to DUI, attended an alcohol safety class for two months, and was placed on unsupervised probation.<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> (SOR 1.d)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between October 2000 and November 2001, Applicant's drinking moderated but did not cease.  He would drink one or two beers each weekend and insists the 
only time he had more than two beers at once was on November 6, 2001, when he and his girlfriend went out for a birthday celebration. That evening, he was 
arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) and other moving violations after he went the wrong way down a one-way street and accidently ran a police car off 
the road. He failed field sobriety test but insists he was disadvantaged by a bad leg he had broken years earlier. He was found guilty based on his refusal to 
submit to breath or blood tests, given a one-year suspended imposition of sentence, ordered to perform community service, and assessed fines and costs. (SOR 
1.g)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's three arrests for DUI / DWI each occurred in separate states. He was afforded first offender status in each state, but the record clearly shows his 
offenses to be violations of each state's criminal code.<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> (SOR 2.a)</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the SOR allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative 
guidelines to be applied here are those conditions listed under Guideline G (alcohol consumption) and Guideline J (criminal conduct).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted 
facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the 
Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no 
one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion on the issue of whether, despite the government's information, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access.<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's 
suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Excessive alcohol consumption is a security concern (Guideline G) because it often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to 
control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The government has established a <EM>prima facie 
</EM>case for disqualification under this guideline. Applicant has abused alcohol several times since 1974. His drink of choice appears to be beer and he has 
consumed more than 10 beers several times. (SOR 1.a) His alcohol-related behavior has resulted in three DUI/DWI convictions (SOR 1.b, 1.d, 1.g) and a 
diagnosis of alcohol abuse by a licensed clinician, who also recommended Applicant abstain from further use of alcohol as of December 2000. Four months 
later, a psychiatrist concurred in this diagnosis. (1.c, 1.e, 1.f) Applicant's alcohol abuse has also cost him a security clearance for work with another federal 
agency. (1.h) On these facts, Guideline G disqualifying condition (DC) 1,<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> DC 3,<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> DC 4,<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 5<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Balanced against the disqualifying information, Applicant has provided nothing to support any of the Guideline G mitigating conditions. To the contrary, he 
violated his August 2001 Recovery Agreement, was arrested shortly three months later for DWI, and still drinks in spite of a clinical recommendation he stop 
using alcohol. (SOR 1.i) Absent substantial information to suggest he is making changes in his approach to alcohol sufficient to overcome concerns resulting 
from 30 years of alcohol abuse and alcohol-related adverse conduct, I find against Applicant as to the allegations contained in SOR paragraph 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal conduct is a security concern (Guideline J) because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness. A person who is willing to disregard laws intended to protect society may also disregard rules and procedures intended to protect classified 
information. The government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under this guideline. Applicant's arrests for DUI / DWI are criminal 
offenses in each of the states where they occurred. (SOR 2.a) The factor leading to those arrests, namely Applicant's abuse of alcohol, is still present, and 
commonsense suggests he will continue to drink and drive in the future. These facts support application of Guideline J DC 1<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> and DC 2.<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In weighing availability of the listed Guideline J mitigating conditions, only MC 1<A HREF="02-33786.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> might apply. Applicant's last arrest was three years ago. However, absent 
substantial information showing Applicant's alcohol abuse is no longer a concern, and in view of the fact that all three arrests occurred within a four-year 
period, I conclude his criminal conduct is recent. As for the other mitigating conditions, there is absolutely no basis for application. The conduct was not 
isolated, he was not acquitted of any of the charges, and, in light of his continued use of alcohol, there is no evidence of rehabilitation. I find against the 
Applicant as to the allegations in SOR paragraph 2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These foregoing raises significant doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion 
expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests. Absent substantial information to resolve those doubts, which Applicant failed to provide, I 
conclude the record evidence weighs in favor of the government's decision to deny Applicant access to classified information.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
