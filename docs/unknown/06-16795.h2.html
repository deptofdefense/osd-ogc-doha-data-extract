<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Fifty-one-year-old Applicant had eleven alleged delinquent debts listed on her statement of reasons (SOR).  One debt was not substantiated.  The ten remaining delinquent SOR debts totaled 
$13,936.  The SOR debts became delinquent between 1999 and 2006. </SPAN> She did not attempt to pay, settle, or pay any of her them.  She falsely answered two questions on her Security Clearance 
Application concerning delinquent debts because she was embarrassed about her financial circumstances.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">She has not mitigated concerns about financial considerations and personal conduct.  
Clearance is denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On May 19, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security Clearance Application <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SF 86).<A HREF="06-16795.h2.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN> On August 31, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.<A HREF="06-16795.h2.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges 
security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct).  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In an answer, notarized on September 17, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided at a hearing.<A HREF="06-16795.h2.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  On October 31, 2006, the case was assigned to me.  
The hearing was held on November 27, 2006.  DOHA received the hearing record (R.) on December 12, 2006, and I received it on December 13, 2006.    </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations under Guidelines F and E, Applicant admitted that she was responsible for the eleven debts listed on the SOR, and that she falsified Questions 38 and 39 of her SF 86.<A HREF="06-16795.h2.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  
Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact, except I have determined that she is responsible for ten of the eleven SOR debts.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of 
record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 51-years-old (R. 5).  For the last eighteen months, she has been employed by a United States government contractor as lead custodian.<A HREF="06-16795.h2.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  She needs a clearance so she can enter and 
clean restricted areas (R. 56).  From 1996 to 2001, she drove a cab.  From 2001 to 2004, she cleaned houses.  From 2004 to 2005, she held three different jobs, but worked primarily in staffing 
services.  There was no evidence presented concerning her job performance.</P> 
 
<P> Immediately prior to starting her job with a government contractor, she was unemployed for three months (R. 19). She has no prior military service.<A HREF="06-16795.h2.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  She has a high school diploma ( R. 5)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN> She 
was married on <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">March 19, 2005.<A HREF="06-16795.h2.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  She was previously married from1985 until February 2005.  Her four children were born in 1971, 1973, 1977 and 1981.<A HREF="06-16795.h2.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Her children are grown and are not 
living at home (R. 42). </SPAN></P>

<P>Applicant told an investigator in 2006 that she had no knowledge of the debt in SOR <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&para; 1.g, and reiterated her lack of knowledge of the origin of this debt at her hearing (R. 33-34, 47-50, 52; Exhibit 
4, at 2).  </SPAN>This debt is not established by substantial evidence.  As to the remaining ten SOR debts, she has not made any payments, and has not attempted to work out a payment plan or a settlement 
(R. 26-50).  She had two consultations with a credit counselor in early 2006 (R. 38).  However, she does not yet have a budget, and does not want to arrange settlements with her creditors (R. 43).  
She would like to start making payments to some of her creditors on the SOR in the future (R. 42-43).  <SUP></SUP></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS), dated March 15, 2006, to a security investigator.<A HREF="06-16795.h2.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Her PFS indicates her gross salary was $1,440 per month, her net salary was $1,180 per 
month, and her expenses totaled $1,450 per month. She listed monthly household expenses as follows:  rent ($500), groceries ($300), clothing ($0), utilities ($245), car expenses ($206), and 
miscellaneous ($200).  She listed two debts:  a car loan with a monthly payment of $348; and a personal loan with a monthly payment of $250.  Her total monthly debt payment was $598.  The PFS 
lists the following assets:  savings of $390; a car with a value of $4,000; and miscellaneous with a value of  $2,000.  After deducting all expenses and her debt payments, she had a negative cash 
flow of $868 per month. Her husband's income is not included in her PFS, and he makes $9,000 per year.  Her husband's income is greater now than it has been in previous years (R. 50).  She does 
not provide financial support to her children, except she provides some money to h</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">er son, who is incarcerated (R. 43).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At her hearing, Applicant was optimistic about her financial future.  Recently, she made some financial progress as demonstrated by her saving enough money to pay cash for a computer (R. 45).  
She was also able to pay off her car loan (R. 45).  She recently started making payments on her delinquent student loan and on a delinquent telephone bill, which are both non-SOR debts (R. 55).  At 
her hearing she emphasized her good intentions ( R. 21-22).  She promised that she would obtain more financial counseling and take care of her most recent debts (R. 20).   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Question 38 of Applicant's security clearance application asks, "[i]n the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?" and Question 39, asks "[a]re you currently over 90 
days delinquent on any debt(s)?"  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When she completed her security clearance application on May 19, 2005, she answered, "No" to both questions because she was ashamed and embarrassed and did 
not want to disclose her delinquent debts (R. 44).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In an evaluation of an applicant's security suitability, an administrative judge must consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant's eligibility 
for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive &para; E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="06-16795.h2.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,  in 
accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.  Directive &para; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E3.1.15 provides, "The applicant is responsible 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of 
persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 
2005).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="06-16795.h2.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty 
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect 
or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>The scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically 
provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance 
decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG>      </CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. </SPAN> Applicant's initial failure to pay her debts is of concern, especially in light of her desire to have access to the nation's secrets.  Under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), "[a]n individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds."  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who fails 
or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  FC DC 1 applies where an applicant has a history of not 
meeting his or her financial obligations.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.1.  FC DC 3 applies where an applicant has exhibited inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's 
actions in initially failing to satisfy her outstanding financial obligations give rise to FC DC 1 and 3.  Applicant admitted she was responsible for ten of the eleven debts listed in the SOR.  She 
recognized that she made poor decisions, and her debts became delinquent because she spent too much money, and had too little income. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> The government produced substantial evidence of these 
two disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
government.<SUP><A HREF="06-16795.h2.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated by substantial evidence under FC MCs 1 or 2 that "the behavior was not recent" or "it was an isolated incident."  Directive &para;&para; 
E2.A6.1.3.1 and E2.A6.1.3.2.  </SPAN>The Directive does not define "recent," and there is no "bright-line" definition of what constitutes "recent" conduct.  Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as 
a whole,<A HREF="06-16795.h2.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> I conclude FC MCs 1 and 2 do not apply because Applicant had multiple (ten) delinquent SOR debts at the time of her hearing, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and her ten delinquent SOR debts are not in the process 
of being resolved. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant disclosed some information to support consideration of FC MC 3, "the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a 
business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)."  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.3.  She indicated she was unemployed for three months in early 2005, and has been 
underemployed periodically over the last decade.  However, her financial difficulties remain largely unexplained.  Although unemployment or underemployment may have caused her financial 
problems, she has not provided enough information about changes in her financial situation, with linkage to the generation of her delinquent debts to warrant full application of FC MC 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">FC MCs 4 and 6 can mitigate a security concern arising from financial problems when</SPAN>, "the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control," <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or "the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts." Directive &para;&para; E2.A6.1.3.4 and E2.A6.1.3.6. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    </SPAN>Based on the sincerity of her testimony, and some indicia of improved financial self-discipline, I have some confidence that she is on the right track towards correction of her financial problems.  
She receives partial credit under FC MC 4 because there is sufficient evidence that she has will begin or has begun to receive financial counseling, and there are some indications  that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="06-16795.h2.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> </SPAN> </P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>FC MC 6 does not apply because there is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of her debts.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Appeal Board has defined the concept of good 
faith, as requiring "</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation."  ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 
2004). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant has not provided any information about how she paid, or attempted to resolve her ten delinquent SOR debts. </SPAN>  </P>

<P>Under Guideline E, "conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that

As 
noted above, Applicant's failure to make progress resolving ten SOR debts is a serious, ongoing, long-term problem and is sufficiently serious to be a security concern.  Moreover, her false 
statement on her 2005 SF 86 is an even greater security concern because it is an indication she may not safeguard classified information. E2.2.1.1. Her actions were knowledgeable and voluntary.  
E2.2.1.2 and E2.2.1.5.<SUP></SUP>  Her debts are currently unpaid, and the falsification occurred relatively recently.  E2.2.1.3.  She is 51 years old, sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her conduct.  
E2.2.1.4.<SUP></SUP> The motivation for the falsification was to conceal information about her financial problems, and her failure to pay her debts was caused by low income as well as her lack of financial self-discipline (an inability to delay or deny personal financial gratification).  E2.2.1.7. A person "who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds" and as 
such there is the potential for pressure and exploitation.  E2.A6.1.1 and E2.2.1.7.  The likelihood of recurrence cannot yet be determined because insufficient evidence was presented about 
improvement in her financial situation, and  corroborating evidence of change is sparse.  E2.2.1.6 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">E2.2.1.9. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The absence of evidence of any prior security violation, her forthright and candid 
statement at her hearing, her evident sincerity about making financial progress, and her remorse about her falsification all weigh in her favor.  However, there is a paucity of supporting evidence 
establishing her rehabilitation.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has not </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mitigated the 
security concerns pertaining to financial considerations and personal conduct.</SPAN></P>
