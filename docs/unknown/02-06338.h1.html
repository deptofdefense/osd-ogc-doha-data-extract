<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>This 42-year-old owner of a computer consultant firm has a history and pattern of alcohol and drug abuse beginning more than 20 years ago and ending only in 
the early 2000s.  He also falsified material fact about his substance abuse and treatment in a 2002 security clearance application and in a sworn statement to a 
Defense Security Service (DSS) agent.  The numerous  recommendations submitted by his colleagues is helpful but does not mitigate his history of misconduct 
and denial.  Mitigation has not been adequately established.  Clearance is denied.   </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On July 28, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons</P> 
 
<P>why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it</P> 
 
<P>is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative 
Judge to conduct proceedings and</P> 
 
<P>determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>On August 26, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge on the 
written record, i.e., without a hearing.  Department Counsel issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 11, 2003.  The Form instructed Applicant 
that any response to the FORM had to be submitted within 30 days of its receipt by Applicant.  Any response was due by October 30, 2003, and Applicant 
timely submitted additional document.  The matter was assigned to me for resolution on January 15, 2004. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 57-year-old employee` of a defense contractor. (Government Exhibit (GX) 1).  The September 25, 2003 SOR contains four allegations under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  In his response to the SOR, Applicant<EM> admits</EM> allegations 1.b., 1.c., and1.d., and denies allegation 1.a.  The admitted 
allegations are accepted and incorporated herein as Findings of Fact.  </P> 
 
<P>After considering the totality of the evidence derived from the FORM and its attachments, including Applicant's responses to the SOR and FORM, I make the 
following additional FINDINGS OF FACT as to the status, past and present, of each SOR allegation:</P> 
 
<P>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant:</P> 
 
<P>1.a. - was indebted to Bank A in the approximate amount of $1,160.00 for a delinquent account charged off in April 2000;</P> 
 
<P>1.b. - was indebted to Town B in the approximate amount of $3,726.70 for a tax lien for delinquent property taxes due for 2001.</P> 
 
<P>1.c. - was indebted to Town B in the approximate amount of $3,374.00 fora a tax lien for delinquent property taxes for 2002;</P> 
 
<P>1.d. - had at least seven (7) different tax liens files against him by Town B for delinquent property taxes since 1996.</P> 
 
<P>As of May 20, 2003, none of the three debts cited above in 1.a., 1.b., or 1.c. had been paid or otherwise resolved. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant</P> 
 
<P>in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding</P> 
 
<P>the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the</P> 
 
<P>individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)</P> 
 
<P>the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation</P> 
 
<P>for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood</P> 
 
<P>of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my 
overall conclusion.</P> 
 
<P>Because each security case presents its own facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed</P> 
 
<P>that the factors cited above exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally</P> 
 
<P>in every case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may 
be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable financial judgment and conduct.  Because Applicant chose to have 
this matter decided without a hearing and without submitting any additional information in response to the FORM, all credibility determinations and findings of 
fact are necessarily based entirely on the contents of the FORM and applicant's response.</P> 
 
<P>The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related 
to the ultimate question of</P> 
 
<P>whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  In reaching the fair and impartial overall common 
sense determination based on the "whole person" concept required by the Directive, the Administrative Judge is not permitted to speculate, but can only draw 
those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  In addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge 
must make</P> 
 
<P>critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses, here based solely on the written record. </P> 
 
<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified information is entrusted to civilian workers</P> 
 
<P>who must be counted on to safeguard classified information and material twenty-four hours a day.</P> 
 
<P>The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an</P> 
 
<P>applicant for a security clearance, in his or her private life or connected to work, may be involved</P> 
 
<P>in conduct that demonstrates poor judgment, untrustworthiness, or unreliability.  These concerns include consideration of the potential, as well as the actual, 
risk that an applicant may deliberately</P> 
 
<P>or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
 
<P>An applicant's admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the Government</P> 
 
<P>of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are denied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the 
initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden (either</P> 
 
<P>by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts 
to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence</P> 
 
<P>of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the</P> 
 
<P>Government based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended,</P> 
 
<P>at E2.2.2., "any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of national security will be resolved in favor of the 
nation's security."</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>As to allegation 1.a., above, Applicant does not appear to be denying the existence of the debts so much as denying knowledge of the debt.  In his August 26, 
2003 response to the SOR, he indicated his intent to contact Bank A to ask about the status of the debt (Item 2).  In his November 2003 response to the FORM, 
Applicant again addresses this debt but does not specifically state he has contacted the bank or what the status and amount of the debt actually is.  I have 
considered his statement/suggestion that the debt has been "satisfactorily closed." The problem with accepting this claim is that there is no evidence supporting 
his claim or even suggesting that the credit report is incorrect.</P> 
 
<P>As to the nine tax liens by Town B (1.b. (one), 1.b. (1), and 1.c (seven), I have carefully considered Applicant's explanations in his response to the FORM.  He 
is correct that only the tax lines for 2001 and 2002 (totaling about $7,100) are indicated as being still active or open. The seven liens cited in SOR 1.d. are cited 
simply as having existed but subsequently paid off or otherwise resolved.  As I understand the SOR, it is the fact of nine successive liens between 1995 and 
2002 </P> 
 
<P>that concerns the Government. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant explains his state of mind as follows:</P> 
 
<P>Now that I have seen a credit report and I can se the reporting of a lien, plus the fact of this investigation, which I never would have dreamed or guessed would 
occur, I realize I should have paid more and quicker attention to the wording Lien."</P> 
 
<P>Applicant expresses his present understanding and intentions, "my current income and working with CCCS [consumer credit counseling service] will allow me 
to clear this condition within a very short spell (Response to the FORM). </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's statement that the current tax liens total "just over $7,000" is correct, but it misses the point or a concern caused by a failure to comply with his tax 
obligations for nine successive years (Id.).  In his sworn statement of November 29, 2001 (Item 5), Applicant admits his "continued laxity" in saving enough 
money each year to pay his taxes.  His continued laxity lapped over from year to year, so when he began to make payments, the money was actually credited to 
amounts due for earlier years, which explain why those earlier debts are now paid off but the debts for recent years are delinquent. </P> 
 
<P>I note in his most recent submission his statement that he has "already requested [Bank A]</P> 
 
<P>to investigate this credit report entry"and that credit counseling service has told him the account is "at least misstated and/or probably incorrect." (Response ro 
FORM at page 1).  </P> 
 
<P>Since this matter is being decided without a hearing, my evaluation is necessarily limited to the contents of the various documents that are found in the case file, 
the latest of which is Applicant's response to the FORM.  Applicant's loyalty is not a issue in this matter, only his  judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  
While his dedication to his family is obvious and admirable, the guidelines in DoD Directive 5220.6 preclude the granting or retention of a security clearance to 
anyone who s conduct violates one of more of those guidelines.  I have considered Applicant's view of his own conduct, but the fact remains that he has shown 
a nine year inability or unwillingness to pay his properttaes on a timely baisis. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a man of 42, born in 1961.  He first received a DoD Secret-level security clearance in 1989, at age 28 (Item 4 at 31).  The Government's concerns 
about Applicant fall into three areas: (1) drug abuse), (2) alcohol abuse, and (3) personal misconduct, specifically falsifications on his November 2002 SF 86 
<EM>and</EM> in a December 2002 sworn statement to a DSS agent about the nature and extent of his substance abuse.  </P> 
 
<P>I  have carefully considered Applicant's submissions.  In a letter, dated October 14, 2003, </P> 
 
<P>from the hospital-related treatment program cited above, the Certified Drug Abuse Counselor who worked with Applicant in 2000, states his understanding that 
Applicant has remained  abstinent from alcohol since 2000, has remained active in his aftercare, and has returned to speak at subsequent programs as a 
successful graduate (Item 2 at page 11).  His wife, father, and brother speak of the stress he was under when he started the company and view him now as a man 
who has learned to live with stress and to take control of his life, including abstinence from drugs and alcohol (<EM>Id</EM>, at pages 12, 13, 14).  </P> 
 
<P>In one of Applicant's written submissions (Item 2 at page 19), a fellow attendee at Narcotics Anonymous meetings states that Applicant recently told him "that 
he was less than truthful on his [security clearance] application."  Another fellow NA attendee states that Applicant told him "that he had not been forthcoming 
regarding the extent of his drug use prior to entering the rooms of NA," but has "recognized his errant mistake and has corrected the untruthful information" 
(<EM>Id</EM>., at page 21).  His professional colleagues and friends speak highly of his dedication and integrity (<EM>Id</EM>., at pages 15 - 23).  I have given consideration and 
significant weight to the impressive praise and recommendations from Applicant's many supporters.  </P> 
 
<P>However, looking at Applicant under the Directive's whole person concept, I find the following direct and objective evidence to remain of the greatest security 
concern. </P> 
 
<P>* Applicant was an extensive user and abuser of marijuana  from about 1980 (his late teens)  to 1993 and cocaine in the early 1990s (his early 30s) and again 
from early 1999 to October 2000. </P> 
 
<P>* Applicant abused three different prescription pain killer drugs at various times between1996 and October 2000.  </P> 
 
<P>* Applicant abused alcohol for a period of approximately 10 years or more ("mid to late adulthood"), often in conjunction with his use of prescription pain 
killer drugs (Item 5 at 2) and ending in 2000.  </P> 
 
<P>* Applicant was treated after August 2000 for both polysubstance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, and pain killer medications)(Item 2 at page 3) and anxiety/depression 
(Item 6 at page 1).</P> 
 
<P>* Applicant deliberately falsified material information on his November 26, 2000 SF 86 <EM>and</EM> in his sworn statement to DSS in December 2002.</P> 
 
<P>* Applicant's medical records show a discharge diagnosis (11/10/2000) of Axis I - Major Depression, Polysubstance Dependence, Axis III - Tendon Pull, and 
Axis IV -  Moderate Stressors, work and marital stress.  The Condition and Prognosis at Discharge currently "stable" with a "prognosis [that] is good contingent 
upon the patient's following through on his stated aftercare plan, i.e., 12-step attendance and out-patient individual therapy with Dr. [A]" (Item 7 at page 24).   
Later medical records) pertain to a "Lumbar Epidural Steroid Administration"(May 2001) on Applicant's spine; a second such procedure, after which Imetrex, 
Prozac, and a third drug  were prescribed (June 2002) (Item 7 at page 61); a second such procedure on September 13, 2002, after which Imitrex and a second 
drug were prescribed (Id., at page 65) and a third such procedure on October 7, 2002 (Id., at page 67).  The prescription painkillers he used included Percocet, 
Vicodin, and Oxycontin (Item 2 at pages 2, 3).  </P> 
 
<P>This case contains an unusual number of factors of security concern.  This 42-year-old Applicant has come a long way in his personal and professional life, 
including owning his own company for about 13 years and has held a DoD Secret security clearance since March 1989 (GX 4 at page 31).  At the same time, he 
has demonstrated a continuing pattern of bad judgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness over a variety of problems areas.  </P> 
 
<P>Under <EM>Guideline H</EM>, the overall record shows that Applicant used illegal drugs during the period when he requested and received a DoD security clearance.  In 
addition, Applicant abused prescribed drugs (all painkillers) during the same period.  I have carefully considered Applicant's explanations for why he did not 
consider himself to be an alcoholic or drug abuser (Item 2 at pages 3, 4).  He claims he was simply unable to believe he has such problems.  Such denials are 
generally indicative of a state of denial and are not uncommon in DOHA adjudications.  Also suspect are claims of enlightenment that suddenly make the 
individual a new person who can be relied upon to make a definitive break from old patterns of negative behavior.  All such claims/evidence must be 
considered in the context of the total evidence and a conclusion as to Applicant's credibility.  </P> 
 
<P>Considering the evidence as a whole, I find the following specific adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</P> 
 
<P>Under<EM> Guideline H (Drugs), </EM>the Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: 1. Any drug abuse; and 2. Illegal drug 
possession.  Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:1. The drug involvement was not recent, since the last use was in late 2000; 3. A 
demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future; and 4. Satisfactory completion of a drug treatment program prescribed by a credentialed medical 
professional.  I find however that the mitigating effect of the three cited conditions is lessened by the time span over which Applicant was a substance abuser. </P> 
 
<P>Under <EM>Guideline G </EM>(Alcohol), Disqualifying Condition 4. Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment is applicable.  Mitigating 
Condition 3. Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety, is applicable but, as with Guideline H, its effect is lessened by the time span over which 
Applicant was a substance abuser . . . </P> 
 
<P>Under <EM>Guideline E </EM>(Personal Conduct), Disqualifying Conditions 2 (The deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of material facts from any personnel 
security questionnaire (SF 86)) is clearly applicable as is DC 3 (Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters 
to an investigator . . . in connection with a personal security or trustworthiness determination) and DC 5 (A pattern or history of dishonesty or rule violations).  
Based on all of the available evidence, I conclude that the falsifications are both highly serious and current.  At the same time, Applicant has not overcome the 
negative impact of the evidence by any sufficient evidence of mitigation.</P> 
 
<P>Overall, along with what I conclude were long term denials of his substance abuse problem, Applicant has continued a pattern of denial as to his responsibility 
for the falsifications alleged and established under SOR 3.a., 3.b., and 3.c.  Considering his age, maturity, education, and business and security clearance 
experience, his explanations for (1) his omission of any mention of the 2000 alcohol-related treatment program from his answer to Question 30 on his 
November 2002 SF 86 (SOR 3.a.); his failure to include his cocaine use in his answer to Question 27 (SOR 3.b.); and his failure to mention his cocaine and 
marijuana use, and his abuse of prescribed medications other than Oxycontin, from his sworn statement to DSS in October 2002 (SOR 3.c.) are simply not 
credible and do not constitute a valid and acceptable excuse for his serious misconduct.</P>
