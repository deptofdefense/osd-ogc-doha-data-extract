<P>Applicant, who is a U.S. naturalized citizen and was a citizen of Algeria solely by virtue of his birth and his parents' birth in the country, and who applied for an 
obtained an Algerian passport for use in emergency situations when traveling to and from Algeria in the future, fails to absolve himself of preference concerns,

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 18, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on January 19, 2004, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on March 10, 2004, and was scheduled for hearing 
on April 6, 2004.  A hearing was convened on April 6, 2004, for the purpose of considering whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, 
continue, deny, or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of one exhibit; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) 
and one exhibit.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on April 19, 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before the close of the hearing, Department Counsel requested official notice be take of three US State Department official documents covering Algeria.  There 
being no objection from Applicant, and good cause being shown, official notice was taken of the State Department documents.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Prior to the close of the hearing, Applicant volunteered in his testimony that about a month ago he received an Algerian passport that he had applied for several 
months before after learning he was a dual citizen of Algeria (R.T., at 60-61).  Based on this new information, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to 
add a Guideline C (foreign preference) allegation to conform with the evidence.  Following discussion, the Government's proposed amendment was granted for 
good cause shown.  Under amended paragraph 2, Applicant is alleged to (a) have exercised dual citizenship by applying for an Algerian passport in late 2003 or 
early 2004 and (b) currently possess an Algerian passport.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to amended paragraph 2 by admitting his obtaining an Algerian passport for emergency purposes when necessary to travel to Algeria on 
short notice without having to go through the visa process associated with using his U.S. passport.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant, in turn, was informed of the ASDC3I memorandum of August 16, 2000, concerning possession of foreign passports by applicants for security 
clearances.  At Applicant's request, the record was held open an additional 14 days to afford Applicant the opportunity to obtain a copy of the ASDC3I 
memorandum (<EM>viz.</EM>, the Money Memorandum) and determine what course of action he wished to take with respect to his Algerian passport.  By his faxed 
submission of April 22, 2004, Applicant acknowledged receiving a copy of the Money Memorandum.  He confirmed his election to keep his Algerian passport 
for emergency circumstances should they arise when making plans to travel to Algeria to see family members (<EM>see </EM>ex. B).  Responding to Applicant's post-hearing election to keep his Algerian passport,  Department Counsel contends that Applicant's security clearance must be denied.  The issue is taken under 
advisement for consideration on the merits.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to (a) have a mother, brother and sister who are citizens of Algeria residing in that country, (b) have a wife who he met 
on the internet who is a dual citizen of Algeria and France residing in the US, (c) maintain contact with his mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law and two 
brothers-in-law who are citizens of Algeria currently residing in Algeria and (d) to have traveled with his wife to Algeria from February 2001 to March 2001 to 
have a traditional Algerian wedding celebration.  For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 51-year old senior staff engineer for a defense contractor who seeks to retain his security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and 
admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant immigrated to the U.S. in 1973.  He received his graduate training from a prestigious state university in the US and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen 
in 1984.  In 1992, he brought his mother to the U.S. for a visit.  She stayed one month and returned to Algeria where she has remained.  His father was a taxi 
driver in Algeria before he passed away.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had an older sister who was a citizen and resident of Algeria before her death from an earthquake that struck Algeria in May 2003.  She had worked 
for an Algerian oil company and was divorced at the time of her sudden death.  Applicant has not maintained contact with his sister's ex-husband.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has an older brother and a younger sister who are citizens and residents of Algeria.  His brother is a physician who works in the oil fields for a private 
company and talks to Applicant  to him on a regular basis.  Applicant's surviving sister is a high school superintendent; who is neither employed by nor 
maintains contact with the Algerian government.  Her husband teaches pharmacy classes in a local university but likewise has no contact with the Algerian 
government.  Applicant maintains regular telephone contact with his surviving sister.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant met his spouse, an Algerian citizen, through the internet and married her in November 2001 in the US.  Later the same year, he and his spouse 
traveled to Algeria for a ceremonial marriage that included both families (R.T., at 48-49).  Applicant's spouse remains very close to her family residing in 
Algeria.  Although she doesn't belong to any Algerian community groups in the U.S., she has shown no interest to date in becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen.  
She keeps regular contact with her parents, two sisters (one of who resides in France) and two brothers (R.T., at 50-54).  None of his spouse's immediate family 
has ever visited her or Applicant in the U.S.  Applicant's attempts to obtain a visa for his mother-in-law come to the U.S. in 2001 were denied by U.S. 
immigration authorities (R.T., at 48-49).  Applicant's spouse's mother does not work in Algeria: The spouse's father was a baker until his retirement two years 
ago.  None of the spouse's immediate family members are, or have ever been, agents or employees of the Algerian government, and none maintain any kind of 
contact with the government that Applicant is aware of (R.T., at 50-54). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since his mother and sister perished in an earthquake that struck Algeria in May 2003, Applicant inherited considerable money from his mother through 
Algeria's intestacy laws (R.T., at 56-57).  Algeria apparently does not have a succession regime that permits the designating of devisees to receive the settler's 
wealth upon his or her death.  Applicant does not have any identified  financial interests still in Algeria.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before completing his security clearance application (SF-86) in January 2002, Applicant was unaware he had dual citizenship status with Algeria, and did not 
list it in his SF-86.  When he applied for a visa to visit Algeria in May 2003 to settle his mother's affairs, he encountered considerable bureaucratic delays in 
obtaining a visa.  To better insulate himself from such delays in the future, he obtained an Algerian passport in May 2003.  He wants the passport for use in 
emergencies when he must travel to Algeria, and for no other purpose.  Advised of DoD's mandatory  clearance bar to persons who possess foreign passports, 
Applicant elected to keep his Algerian passport (<EM>see </EM>ex. B).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">According to official U.S. State Department documents, Algeria is a multiparty republic that is constitutionally constructed and has a presidential form of 
government that includes a bicameral parliament, whose members of both houses are elected by popular vote.  Algeria today is a country in transition from a 
state-administered to an open market economy.  It is currently running unemployment rates in excess of 30 percent in a country whose population exceeds 31 
million.  Historically, Algeria has a poor human rights record, which has actually worsened in certain areas of the country.  Aspects of its continued state of 
emergency continue to place restrictions on individual rights to change their government with the vote.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As Algeria gradually emerges from decades of civil strife between proponents and opponents of an Islamic state, fighting between government forces and 
terrorist groups has continued in rural and mountainous areas, and the country remains in a State of Emergency status.  <EM>See US Department of State Country 
Report</EM> of February 2004.  State Department travel warnings urge Americans to defer non-essential travel to Algeria and to carefully evaluate their security and 
safety should they choose to ignore cautions about travel to the country.  Citing random terrorist attacks and some hostage taking over the past year, the State 
Department cautions both American travelers and Embassy personnel to take special security precautions when making trips outside the capital area. <EM>See US 
State Department Travel Warning </EM>of March 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Dual citizens residing or visiting in Algeria are subject to all Algerian laws affecting U.S. citizens, as well as laws applicable to persons of Algerian nationality 
that impose special obligations on citizens of that country.  <EM>See U.S. State Department Consular Information Sheet</EM> of March 2004.  Dual nationals remain 
subject to Algeria's military service requirements and can be conscripted into service while on Algerian soil.  While such conscripted service seems unlikely to 
confront Applicant, given his age and longstanding U.S. citizenship, it remains a possibility.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Preference</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to 
provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1: The exercise of dual citizenship</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 2: Possession and/or use of a foreign passport.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1: Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including co-habitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or are obligation <EM>are not</EM> citizens of the United States <EM>or may </EM>be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1: An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a 
foreign country.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 2:  Sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1: A determination that the immediate family members, co-habitant or associate  are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a 
foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical 
basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for 
the purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant presents as a conscientious senior engineer for a defense contractor who after being born and raised in Algeria, immigrated to the U.S. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in 1973 to 
seek better economic opportunities.  Claiming the need for an Algerian passport to aid him in emergency situations, he recently applied for and obtained an 
Algerian passport. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Dual citizenship concerns necessarily entail country allegiance assessments and invite critical considerations over acts indicating a preference or not for the 
interests of the foreign country over the interests of the U.S.  In a different vein, the continued residence of his immediate family members (his sister and 
brother) and his wife's immediate family members in Algeria  raises potential concerns about their being vulnerable to future pressure or duress that could 
result in the compromise of classified information.  The issues, as such, raise concerns over Applicant's  preference for a foreign country over the U.S. and the 
potential for members of Applicant's immediate and extended family being placed at risk to pressure or duress to induce Applicant to divulge classified 
information he might be privy to.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of his birth in Algeria to parents of Algerian descent and citizenship, Applicant was  endowed with Algerian citizenship through his parents.  This 
citizenship could not be lost except by</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">express renunciation, approved by the Algerian Government, which Applicant has never explored. To the contrary, two years ago he applied for an Algerian 
passport (an active exercise of dual citizenship) and has since received one.  While he is yet to use his Algerian passport, he has pledged to retain it for use in 
emergency situations when he needs to travel to Algeria on family-related matters.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Risks of his being taken hostage behind Algerian lines and denied the 
customary diplomatic intercession made available to U.S. citizens traveling on US passports cannot be  discounted, given the country threat risks assigned 
Algeria by the U.S. State Department's travel advisory. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Appeal Board has tended to blur convenience/force of law distinctions when appraising legal necessity passport usage in multiple return to country 
situations (as here).  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (February 8, 2001); ISCR Case No. 99-0254 (February 16, 2000).  Exercise of choice to take out and retain his 
Algerian passport out of desire to preserve his options when traveling to Algeria to see his family is itself a voluntary election, not a submission to legal 
compulsion, when made in juxtaposition to known security risks extant in traveling to a country that lacks acceptable security protections against terrorists 
operating within the country.  By applying for and obtaining an Algerian passport, Applicant displayed a conscious preference for Algeria, even if it was for 
perfectly logical and understandable reasons: wanting to see his immediate and extended family members. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">So, even Applicant's limited exercise of dual citizenship is sufficient under the facts of this case to invoke Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1  (exercise of dual 
citizenship) and DC 2 (possession and/or use of a foreign passport) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for foreign preference.  Use and/or possession of a foreign 
passport is considered a <EM>per se</EM> basis for denying or suspending a security clearance under the clarifying provisions of the memorandum of August 16, 2000 
authored by the Asst SecDef forC</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">3</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I ("the ASDC3i memorandum"), unless the foreign passport is surrendered, or the Applicant obtains official approval for its 
use from the appropriate agency of the US Government. Nothing in the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ASDC3i memorandum on foreign passports indicates that possession of a foreign 
passport may be extenuated or mitigated by an applicant's showing of personal hardship and delay typically encountered in utilizing the visa process involved 
with travel abroad on a US passport. DOHA's Appeal Board has construed the ASDC3i memorandum to be legally binding on DOHA administrative judges 
and the Board.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-07625 (May 2004).  Neither judges nor the Board retain jurisdiction to review of pass judgment on the wisdom or 
desirability of the ASDC3i memorandum.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-04237 (August 2003).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concerns over continued Applicant preference for Algeria are considerable for so long as he retains his Algerian passport and dual Algerian citizenship.  With 
unsettled questions still very much in evidence about Applicant's reluctance to take any bold steps towards surrender of his Algerian passport and renunciation 
of his Algerian citizenship, too many preference questions loom at the present time to credit Applicant with satisfying the heavy mitigation burden imposed on 
applicants by the Appeal Board.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant's dual citizenship exercise and  absence of meaningful mitigation efforts, conclusions warrant that 
Applicant's exhibited active dual citizenship by his taking out an Algerian passport.  In so doing, he has demonstrated a preference for Algeria that has not been 
mitigated by documented surrender of the passport and expressed intentions to renounce his dual Algerian citizenship.  Such firm Applicant commitments are 
required to satisfy expressed Appeal Board burden requirements when it comes to successfully discounting residual security risks that exist with his continued 
exercise of dual Algerian citizenship.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraphs 2.a and 2.b of Guideline C. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Besides foreign preference concerns, Government finds security risks associated with (a) Applicant's wife being a citizen of Algeria and his immediate family 
members (<EM>i.e., </EM>sister and brothers) and (b) his extended family members (<EM>i.e., </EM>his mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law and two brothers-in-law) residing in 
Algeria.  Although Applicant's ties to his wife's parents and siblings do not appear to be particularly close, he communicates with them often enough to invite 
application of Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1  (immediate family members, or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a 
citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country) and DC 2 (an immediate family member, <EM>etc.</EM>) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for foreign influence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate <EM>per se</EM> results or mandate particular outcomes for any chosen set of guidelines 
covering risks of foreign influence.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country may not be in another.  While foreign influence cases 
must by practical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing.  Personnel security assessments continue to be 
governed by the same Change 4 requirements of the Directive for appraising the security risks associated with the individual's having family abroad, which 
include both common sense assessments of country risks and information available from public sources.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">So, under these adjudicative guidelines, while an applicant with immediate family domiciled in a hypothetical hostile country might pose a risk of a hostage 
situation, he might conversely be able to neutralize material risks of exploitation of immediate and/or extended family members residing in a friendly country.  
While Algeria cannot be characterized as a particularly close ally of the US, it is not described in State Department official publications as hostile either.  Based 
on reported terrorist activities in the country, Algeria cannot be deemed to provide an acceptable political environment for managing hostage risks.  Without 
such assurances, no reasonable conclusions can be reached that Applicant's immediate and extended family members are not in a position to be exploited by 
Algerian authorities.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the foreign influence provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines are ostensibly neutral as to the character of the subject country, they should not be 
construed to ignore the geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign regime involved.  Algeria is a constitutional republic, governed by executive and 
legislative branches whose leadership and influence is directed and circumscribed by Islamic tenets.  Algeria is also a country with a considerable history of 
ambivalence towards America and its longstanding institutional respect for human rights and the rule of law.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because  Algeria remains a transitioning country that lacks a secure infrastructure and track record for respecting human rights and the rule of law, the risk of a 
pressure or influence situation involving an immediate or extended family member of Applicant's cannot be safely discounted.  Algeria's strategic location and 
political character, when coupled with Applicant's own demonstrated preference for the country, conduce to create security concerns over risks of direct or 
indirect pressure or influence of an immediate or extended family member of Applicant's by Algerian authorities.  These concerns are not sufficiently mitigated 
to permit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of exploitation and pressure attributable to his familial relationships and contacts 
with his immediate and extended family members domiciled  in Algeria.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">So, given the continued presence of Applicant's immediate and extended family members in Algeria, their presence there  presents potential risks of pressure
