<P>Applicant has a history of delinquent accounts that have been placed for collection.  While her financial statement indicates she has made some effort to reduce 
her outstanding obligations, she has made little or no effort to satisfy other indebtedness.  Further, Applicant concealed material facts about her financial 
obligations on a security clearance application.  She failed to mitigate the resulting serious questions about her security suitability.  Clearance is denied.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On October 1, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant alleging facts which raise 
security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not find that 
it is clearly in the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="02-20168.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated October 28, 2003,  Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) and elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu 
of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted a  file of relevant material (FORM) in support of the government's preliminary decision, a copy of which was 
received by Applicant on March 23, 2004.  Applicant was afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation by April 23, 2004. Applicant objected to the FORM and submitted evidence on her own behalf, which was accepted by Department Counsel on or 
about April 28, 2004.  The case was previously assigned to another administrative judge on April 30, 2004, but was reassigned to me on February 18, 2005, due 
to caseload considerations.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant has admitted 17 of 18 factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations under Guideline F, and admitted the allegation regarding Guideline E, 
as stated in the SOR. These admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  </P> 
<P>After a thorough review of the record as a whole, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a separated, 28-year-old administrative assistant employed by a defense contractor.<A HREF="02-20168.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The SOR, paragraph 1, subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.r., details 
18 debts unpaid, including an automobile repossession.<A HREF="02-20168.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant admits SOR subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.p., inclusive and 1.r., and denies 1.q.<A HREF="02-20168.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  She claims 
her financial problems started during 1997 when her car was repossessed.  During the following years until the SOR was issued, she had amassed unpaid debts 
in excess of $11,000, and had made no effort to pay them.  In response to the FORM, Applicant submitted a copy of a credit report dated March 25, 2004, with 
four attached statements indicating she had paid debts listed in SOR.  See the chart below.</P> 
<P>The SOR identifies 17 delinquent accounts totally nearly $11,000.00.  Those accounts, and their current status, are as described below:</P>

<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="02-20168.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case.  Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive: 
nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the applicant, 
and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or presence of 
rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </P> 
<P>The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the SOR allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative 
guidelines to be applied here are those concerns listed under guideline F (financial considerations), Directive,&para; E2.A6.1.1.1. <EM>An  individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds</EM>; and Guideline E (personal conduct), Directive,&para; E2.A5.1.1.1. <EM>Conduct involving 
questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that 
the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</EM></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="02-20168.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears an initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted 
facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>prima facie </EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the 
Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's case. Because no

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's 
suitability for access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="02-20168.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline F   A security concern exists where it is shown an individual is financially overextended, thus being at 
risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An inability or unwillingness to pay one's debts and to manage one's finances in a reasonably sound 
manner may also indicate poor judgment and reliability. <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a long-standing and sizable credit delinquency and another debt remaining from the 
repossession of her car, which was written off by the creditor. In fact, almost two-thirds of her debts were charged off without any payment on her part.  She has 
not paid or otherwise resolved many of the remaining debts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions  (FC DC)  E2.A6.1.2.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>( history of not meeting

find applicable</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> FC Mitigating Condition  E2.A6.1.3.6. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith attempt to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>).  
Because she has paid only</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 15% of her debts and 63% were charged off by the creditors without payment,  I conclude Guideline F against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has also made its case under Guideline E.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's omission of material facts on her answer to Question 38 on SF86 and the lack of any 
mitigating evidence lead me to find applicable </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. <EM> (the deliberate omission, concealment, or 
falsification of relevant material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, 
determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities)</EM>.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
Although PC MC</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> E2.A5.1.3.5. <EM>(the individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM>, 
might apply as </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">some debt has been reduced, nevertheless, a significant amount of her obligations have been written off without payment.  And the fact remains 
that she lied on her security clearance application and has provided no mitigating reasons that would significantly reduce or eliminate her vulnerability to 
coercion, exploitation, or duress.          </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under each applicable adjudicative 
guideline. I have also considered the whole person concept as contemplated by the Directive in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&para; 6.3. To that end, I have reviewed Applicant's criminal conduct 
but as it was not charged as a part of the SOR, it is not the basis for my findings.  A fair and commonsense assessment of the adverse information about 
Applicant's financial history raises reasonable doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and 
discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests. Absent substantial information to resolve those doubts, which Applicant failed to 
provide, I conclude the record evidence shows Applicant has not overcome the information supporting the government's decision to deny Applicant access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P>
