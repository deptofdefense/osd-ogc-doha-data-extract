<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On August 4, 2003, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), the
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR)
alleging facts that raise security concerns about his adverse financial history. The SOR further
informed him that, based on information available to the government, DOHA adjudicators could not
make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or
continue Applicant's security clearance.<A HREF="02-27147.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On October 27, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer) and admitted to all of the
allegations except for subparagraphs 1.f, 1.g, and 1.j. He also requested a determination without a
hearing. On April 8, 2004, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant materials
(FORM) with six exhibits (Items 1 - 6) attached in support of the government's preliminary decision.
A copy was sent to Applicant on April 15, 2004. Applicant received the FORM on May 6, 2004 and
was afforded 30-days to submit additional information in his own behalf. However, he did not
respond to the FORM and the case was assigned to me on June 18, 2004.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant's aforementioned admissions are incorporated herein as facts. A<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fter a thorough
review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant is a 42-year-old electronics and test technician employed by a defense contractor
since October 1999. He also served in the U.S. Air Force from May 1985 until January 1995
achieving the rank of senior airman (E-4). Applicant has been unemployed twice. The first period
was between November 1996 and April 1997, after his company moved jobs to Taiwan and Mexico.
He was also out of work from May 1998 until March 1999. After Applicant left the Air Force in
1995, he opened his own on-line catalog business and a real estate investing venture. He supported
himself through credit while he tried to get his businesses off the ground, but he was never able to
turn a profit from either business and some of his credit card accounts went unpaid. Thereafter, he
pursued jobs in electronics.<A HREF="02-27147.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Since 1992, Applicant has generated over $44,400 in delinquent debts. As of January 2002,
his debt consisted of 10 credit accounts (mostly credit cards) dating as far back as 1992 that were
either delinquent or greater than 120 days past due. He also had one account referred for collection
and two judgments entered against him.<A HREF="02-27147.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant has been steadily employed, sometimes holding
two part-time jobs simultaneously, since March 1999. He claims to have paid or settled the debts
listed at SOR subparagraphs 1.f, 1.g, and 1.j, but has provided no corroborating evidence of this. In
his subject interview with an agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) on July 3, 2002, Applicant
claimed he was trying to work out settlement agreements with some of his creditors, yet there is
nothing in evidence to show his efforts have yielded any results. A Personal Financial Statement
(PFS) given to DSS at the time showed Applicant had about $110 net cash each month, but did not
list payments to any of the creditors listed in the SOR.<A HREF="02-27147.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="02-27147.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an
Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The Administrative Judge must take into
account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the
facts and circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common
sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The presence or absence of
a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an
Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be
measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to
classified information. Having considered the SOR allegations and having reviewed the record
evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are those
conditions listed under Guideline F (financial considerations).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">	</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the
national interest<A HREF="02-27147.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to have access to classified
information. The government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a
preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its
burden, it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for
the Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to
refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a "right" to a security
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="02-27147.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest
in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one
who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national
interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for
access in favor of the government.<A HREF="02-27147.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Under Guideline F, a security concern exists where it is shown </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">an individual is financially
overextended, thus being at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.<A HREF="02-27147.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Also, an
inability to properly manage one's finances may indicate that person may not have the judgment or
reliability necessary to protect classified information. Department Counsel has presented sufficient
evidence in the FORM to establish a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under this guideline and
I conclude that Guideline F disqualifying condition (DC) 1<A HREF="02-27147.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 3<A HREF="02-27147.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  apply here.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant has
delinquent accounts that have not been paid dating back to 1992. Applicant's first delinquent account
dates back to 1992, and he has not made any tangible effort to pay or otherwise resolve his debts. His
PFS suggests he is current on some recent accounts such as his car payment and newer credit cards;
however, his $110 net monthly cash flow is wholly inadequate to address the debts listed in the SOR.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant's debts can be attributed in some measure to his failed personal business ventures
and to his two periods of unemployment. Mitigating condition (MC) 3<A HREF="02-27147.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> applies. Yet the only
reasonable interpretation of this record shows Applicant has taken little or no action to either control
his use of debt in the face of reduced income, or to try and resolve his debt since regaining steady
employment five years ago. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	None of the other mitigating conditions apply to the facts of this case. Even though his last
known delinquency was in 1999, Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> debt is recent in that it is still delinquent five years
later. His financial difficulties are not isolated as there are multiple delinquent accounts over a seven-year period. Further, while Applicant does not want to declare bankruptcy and states he is trying to
settle his delinquencies, he has not sought help from any credit counseling service and there is no
evidence of a systematic good-faith effort to pay or otherwise resolve his debts. I conclude Guideline
F against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and
mitigating conditions as listed under each applicable adjudicative guideline. I have also tried to make
a fair and commonsense assessment of the record before me as required by Directive Section E2.2.3.
This record raises reasonable doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and
to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government
entrusts its interests. Applicant disclosed his debts in his security clearance application and appears
to be candid about his financial problems.<A HREF="02-27147.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> However, absent substantial information about how he
intends to resolve his problems and the government's doubts about his suitability for a clearance,
which Applicant failed to provide, I cannot conclude he has failed to overcome the government's
case.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

5), suggesting only a relative reduction in income, not a fall from affluence. Further, Applicant had two earlier periods
of little or no income from January 1995 to May 1996 and again from November 1996 to April 1997. With these facts
in mind, it appears Department Counsel's concerns about Applicant's candor is misplaced.</SPAN></P>
