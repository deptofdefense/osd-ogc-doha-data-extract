<P>Applicant was arrested in March 1998 after his 14-year-old sister called the police when she became upset by his efforts to supervise her 
weekend activities.  Although he remained in police custody for more than 24 hours, no charges were ever filed against him.  Applicant's 
involvement in this incident and his failure to list the arrest on his SF 86 (<EM>Security Clearance Application</EM>) are mitigated by his exculpatory 
explanation of the circumstances of the arrest, and by the absence of  evidence his arrest involved misconduct which impugns his judgment, 
trustworthiness, or reliability.  Clearance is granted.  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On February 17, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry</EM>," dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 "<EM>Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>" (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary finding under the Directive that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine 
whether he should be granted a security clearance.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 5, 2001, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was 
reassigned to this Administrative Judge because of caseload considerations on June 18, 2001, after having been previously assigned to another 
Administrative Judge.  On July 19, 2001, a hearing was convened for the purpose of considering whether it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Appellant's security clearance.  The Government's case consisted of three exhibits and one witness.  Applicant relied on his own 
testimony.  A transcript (Tr) of the proceeding was received on July 26, 2001.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with explanations, all allegations set forth in the SOR.  I accept Applicant's admissions and 
explanations, and after a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 28-year-old electrical engineer who has been employed by a DoD contractor since September 1999.  He received his BS in 
Electrical Engineering from University A in December 1998 and his MS in Electrical Engineering from University B in August 1999.  He is 
currently working toward a degree in Computer Science at University C.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's involvement in a single, unfortunate incident was the precipitating cause of all allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons.  That 
incident occurred in March 1998 when Applicant was arrested because of a misunderstanding with his 14 -year-old sister, for whom he had 
guardianship responsibilities.  In testimony at his administrative hearing, he provided the only account of this incident which appears in the record. </P> 
 
<P>...to make a long story short, my younger sister had a couple of boys over the house that she wasn't suppose to have.  I asked them to leave and 
my sister didn't like that at all.  She got very upset.  We got into an argument and we got into a confrontation and she called the police.  She 
exaggerated and fabricated some things because she was upset with me.  And the police took me away and they held me overnight. When I was 
released I was told that the case was no paper, I went to a judge and he told me to leave.  There wasn't actually any proceeding or anything, so I 
didn't think that it was.  I would actually have an arrest record for the fact that my sister, from what I found out later on, actually told that she was 
just upset and that, I don't know that the legal term of the case was thrown out or dropped or whatever, but, as far as I knew then, that is what I 
believed happened.<A HREF="01-03633.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Tr. 20</P> 
 
<P>Other than Appellant's account, the only evidence of this incident in the record is a very brief entry in FBI records under the name of Applicant:</P> 
 
<P>Arrested or received (date of arrest)</P> 
 
<P>Charge 1 - simple assault</P> 
 
<P>Court-</P> 
 
<P>Charge-simple assault</P> 
 
<P>Sentence-</P> 
 
<P>(Date) No paper</P> 
 
<P>There is no police report and no descriptive information of this incident from any source other than Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>When Applicant completed his <EM>Security Clearance Application </EM>(SF 86) in October 1999, he answered "no" to question 26 which asked if "in 
the last 7 years" he had "been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25."<A HREF="01-03633.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Applicant 
had already answered "no" to each of the questions posed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25, thus denying he had been arrested for any offense 
during the previous 7 years. </P> 
 
<P>Later when Applicant was interviewed by the Defense Security Service (DSS) in July 2000, he admitted the March 1998 arrest, but explained he 
had not listed the arrest because "there was no charge and the case was dismissed" (Gov. Exh. 2).  While Applicant has subsequently learned he 
was required to list the March 1998 arrest (in response to question 26), he adamantly insists he did not believe information about the March 1998 
incident was responsive to question 26 (of the <EM>Security Clearance Application</EM>) at the time he completed the form.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's explanation for why he did not list the March 1998 arrest is credible because he had no motive to lie.  He believed at the time and 
continues to believe he was arrested because of a misunderstanding with his sister.  He insists he had not done anything illegal to warrant being 
arrested, and there is no evidence in the record to challenge his claimed innocence.  His explanation for not listing the March 1998 arrest in 
response to question 26 is reasonable--given the circumstances of his arrest and the subsequent dismissal of the matter with "no paper."  If he had 
believed he was required to list this arrest, he could and would have listed it and provided the same unchallenged, exculpatory explanation he has 
given several times since then.  He did not list the arrest because he honestly believed information about this incident was not responsive to 
question 26 and the information which this question seeks to elicit.</P> 
 
<P>The record does not include any information about Applicant's duty performance.</P>

</P> 
 
<P>The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges 
on a case by case basis with an eye toward making decisions with reasonable consistency which are clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security.  In making these overall common sense determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, 
both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but also in the context of the factors set forth in 
Sections 6.3 of the Directive.  In that vein, the Government not only has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must 
also demonstrate the facts proven have a nexus to Applicant's lack of security worthiness.</P> 
 
<P>The following Adjudicative Guidelines are deemed applicable to the instant matter:</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CRIMINAL CONDUCT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></SPAN>(Guideline J)</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Concern: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>E2.A10.1.2.1. Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>E2.A10.1.3.1. The criminal behavior was not recent;</P> 
 
<P>E2.A10.1.3.2. The crime was an isolated incident;</P> 
 
<P>E2.A10.1.3.4. The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PERSONAL CONDUCT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></SPAN>(Guideline E)</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwilling to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine 
security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, award fiduciary responsibilities.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>E2.A5.1.3.1. The information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability;</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government establishes its case, the 
burden or persuasion shifts to Applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or extenuates the disqualifying 
conduct and demonstrates it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  
Where the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has a heavy 
burden or persuasion to demonstrate he is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the <EM>United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy 
v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands the Court's rationale, doubts are to be resolved against an Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Having considered the record evidence in accordance with the appropriate legal precepts and guidelines, this Administrative Judge concludes the 
Government has established its case with regard to Guideline J, but has not established its case with regard to Guideline E.  In reaching my 
decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors enumerated in Section 6.3, as well as those referred to in the 
section dealing with the Adjudication Process, both in the Directive.</P> 
 
<P>A security concern is raised by Applicant's arrest for simple assault in March 1998.  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a 
person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</P> 
 
<P>The security concern raised by Applicant's March 1998 arrest is mitigated by the circumstances of that arrest and by the fact no charges were 
ever filed against him.  Applicant has credibly explained he was arrested on a Saturday evening after his 14-year-old sister became upset because 
he had objected to her having male visitors.  She called the police.  The police arrested Applicant and held him for more than 24 hours.  He was 
released on the following Monday morning without any charges ever being filed against him.  This arrest was an isolated incident which occurred 
more than three years ago (E2.A10.1.3.1. and E2.A10.1.3.2.).  Accepting his version of events, which has not been challenged, Applicant 
arguably was involved in conduct leading up to the arrest involuntarily because of his efforts to appropriately supervise his younger sister.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's failure to list the above arrest in response to question 26 on the his <EM>Security Clearance Application </EM>is not found to raise a security 
concern under Guideline J for the reasons set forth below.  Guideline J is concluded for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>The evidence does not establish Applicant deliberately omitted material facts from the <EM>Security Clearance Application </EM>(SF 86) which he 
completed in October 1999 (Gov. Exh. 1).  He has credibly explained he did not list the March 1998 arrest in response to question 26 because he 
did not believe information about an incident which was dismissed with "no paper" was responsive to the question and the information which the 
question sought to elicit. </P> 
 
<P>Moreover, even if Applicant's explanation for not listing the arrest is rejected, the security concern raised by Applicant's "no" answer to question 
26 is mitigated by the fact the information omitted from the questionnaire was not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or 
reliability (E2.A5.1.3.1.).  Applicant was arrested in March 1998 when his 14-year-old sister became upset and called the police after he 
attempted to supervise her weekend activities.  Although he remained in police custody for more than 24 hours, no charges were ever filed against 
Applicant because of this incident.  There is no evidence in the file, Applicant did anything illegal prior to being arrested, and his exculpatory 
explanation for the circumstances of the arrest is corroborated by the dismissal of the matter and by the brief entry in the FBI records.  There is no 
evidence in the record Applicant was involved in misconduct in March 1998 which impugns his integrity and raises questions about his judgment, 
trustworthiness, or reliability.  Guideline E is concluded for Applicant. </P>
