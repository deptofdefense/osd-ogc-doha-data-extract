<P>The record evidence shows Applicant deliberately concealed or omitted his history of illegal drug use in response to a specific question on his security-clearance application requiring that information. Applicant failed to successfully explain or mitigate the resulting security concern. Clearance is denied.   </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On February 23, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.<A HREF="04-00815.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges security 
concerns under Guideline E for personal conduct (falsification) and Guideline J for criminal conduct related to the falsification. Applicant replied to the SOR on 
arch 25, 2005, his response was incomplete, and he requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on June 17, 2005, and a notice of hearing was issued 
scheduling the hearing for September 14, 2005. Applicant appeared without counsel and the hearing took place as scheduled. I kept the record open to allow 
Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence, and that document is marked and admitted, without objections, as Exhibit C. DOHA received the 
transcript September 27, 2005. </P> 
<P><CENTER> <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>At the start of the hearing, I clarified Applicant's response to the SOR, and Applicant admitted to the falsification allegation in SOR subparagraph 1.a, and his 
admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 32-year-old married man employed as a small craft operator for a contractor providing services to a military installation. Applicant's job is to 
maintain and operate patrol boats and landing craft used to patrol a river adjoining the military installation. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance for the 
first time, although he held an interim security clearance for some time without a negative incident or problem. </P> 
<P>To obtain a security clearance, Applicant completed and signed a security-clearance application on or about March 16, 2001 (Exhibit 1). In response to 
Question 27, Applicant answered "no," thereby denying having used any illegal drug (including marijuana and cocaine) within the last seven years or since the 
age of 16, whichever is shorter. This means Applicant was required to disclose any illegal drug use dating back to about March 16, 1994. In signing the 
application, Applicant certified his statements were true, complete, and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief and made in good faith, and that he 
understood that a knowing and willful false statement could be punished under federal law.  </P> 
<P>In March 2002, Applicant was interviewed during the official security clearance  investigation. The interview produced a sworn statement (Exhibit 4), wherein 
Applicant addressed several subjects, including his history of illegal drug use. Concerning marijuana, he admitted using it on a monthly basis from 1989 to 
August 1998. Concerning cocaine, he admitted using it on two to three occasions, once in 1992, and the other two between September 1995 and February 1996. 
He stated he had no intention of being involved with illegal drugs in the future. Concerning his security-clearance application, he admitted not listing his drug 
use because he was afraid he would not obtain a clearance and he would lose his job. Also, he admitted he knew he was providing false information about his 
past illegal drug use. </P> 
<P>Applicant addressed his falsification during his hearing testimony. He made no excuses and apologized for lying. His last use of any illegal drug was in 1998. 
During cross-examination, Applicant admitted he had not attempted to contact anybody to correct his false answer to Question 27. Likewise, he admitted it was 
not until he was confronted during the March 2002 interview that he admitted his false answer to Question 27. Applicant presented favorable documentary 
evidence (Exhibits A, B, and C) attesting to his good work history. Also, he presented a witness who vouched for Applicant's good character. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on 
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree of 
trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a 
determination of an applicant's loyalty.<A HREF="04-00815.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Instead, it is determination that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for granting 
a clearance.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="04-00815.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> There is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="04-00815.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted 
facts.<A HREF="04-00815.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="04-00815.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> The DOHA Appeal 
Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence standard.<A HREF="04-00815.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than 
a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="04-00815.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden, an applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="04-00815.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance 
decision.<A HREF="04-00815.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="04-00815.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the<STRONG> </STRONG>central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral 
statement to the Government when applying for a security clearance or in other official matters is a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and 
willfully. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An omission of relevant and material information, for example, is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, 
misunderstood the question, or thought the information did not need to be reported.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline E. I conclude Applicant deliberately provided false 
information about his history of illegal drug use when he denied such use during the last seven years in response to Question 27 of his security-clearance 
application. His denial was a knowing and willful falsification. Accordingly, DC 2<A HREF="04-00815.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> applies against Applicant. His falsification of his security-clearance 
application creates doubt about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.     </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline E and conclude none apply. Falsification of a security-clearance application is a serious matter, not easily 
mitigated or explained away. Indeed, Applicant's concerns about not obtaining a clearance or loss of employment neither explain nor mitigate the matter. 
Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. A history of illegal behavior indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">regulations, practices, or 
procedures concerning safeguarding and handling classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline J. Applicant engaged in criminal conduct by providing a 
false answer on his security-clearance application in violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001, which is a felony-level offense. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Given these circumstances, both DC 1<A HREF="04-00815.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> and 
DC 2<A HREF="04-00815.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> apply against Applicant. His criminal conduct creates doubt about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. No mitigating conditions apply. 
Accordingly, Guideline J is decided against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To conclude, this is yet another case involving an Applicant whose past illegal drug use is mitigated as not recent and a clearance in all likelihood would have 
been granted, but for Applicant's false statement about his background. In reaching my decision, I considered the evidence as a whole, both favorable and 
unfavorable, the whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and other appropriate factors and guidelines in the Directive.   </SPAN></P>
