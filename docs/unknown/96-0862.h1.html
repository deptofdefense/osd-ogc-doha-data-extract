<P><STRONG><U>STATEMENT OF CASE</U></STRONG></P>

<P>On December 9, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>"Safeguarding Classified Information Within
Industry,"</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>"Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance
Review Program"</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to ------------------- (Applicant), which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted,
continued, denied, or revoked.</P>

<P>A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</P>

<P>In a sworn written statement, dated January 2, 1997, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on a
written record, in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on February 6, 1997.  A complete copy of the file of relevant
material (FORM)<A HREF="96-0862.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or
mitigation.  He chose no to do so.  The case was initially assigned to Administrative Judge John R. Erck on April 3, 1997, but due to caseload considerations,
was subsequently reassigned to, and received by, this Administrative Judge on April 28, 1997.</P>

<P><STRONG><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></STRONG></P>

<P>Applicant has admitted nearly all of the factual allegations pertaining to drug involvement under Criterion H (subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., and 1.e.).  Those
admissions are hereby incorporated herein as findings of fact.  He has denied subparagraph 1.c. of the SOR.</P>

<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P>

<P>Applicant is a thirty-four year old male employed by a defense contractor, and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been
divulged.</P>

<P>Applicant has been a marijuana abuser for about fifteen years, commencing in September 1981, when he was eighteen years old, and continuing until at least
June 1996.<A HREF="96-0862.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  He commenced using marijuana out of curiosity and peer pressure, and, because he enjoyed the effect of marijuana, continued to abuse it, at times,
up to two times per month.  It was estimated that he abused marijuana on approximately 25 occasions until about 1988.  He ceased his marijuana abuse about
the time he completed his Security Clearance Application, in June 1996, but before undergoing an interview with an agent of the Defense Investigative Service
(DIS), in October 1996.  During that interview, and in his sworn written statement, Applicant stated:<A HREF="96-0862.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A></P>

<P>I do not intend to smoke marijuana in the future, but consider it reasonably possible that I will take a few puffs of a joint if I am at a party and one is passed to
me.</P>

<P>However, upon receipt of the SOR, Applicant underwent a <EM>conversion</EM>:<A HREF="96-0862.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A></P>

<P>. . . after realizing the effect marijuana use may have on [Applicant's] current employment status and future employment opportunities and since [Applicant has]
no strong desire to use marijuana, [Applicant has] decided that [he] will not use marijuana at any time in the future.</P>

<P>Applicant also commenced using hashish during the early 1980s, to enhance his social interaction, and continued to abuse it on seven or eight occasions, until
about 1990.  He ceased his hashish abuse because he had lost interest in it, and has "no specific intentions to use hashish in the future."<A HREF="96-0862.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A>  There is no evidence
to rebut Applicant's contentions that he has abstained from hashish since about 1990.</P>

<P>During the period of his substance abuse, Applicant purchased marijuana and hashish on an unspecified number of occasions during the 1980s, spending as
much as ten dollars a month for his purchases.  There is no evidence to rebut Applicant's contentions that he has not made any such purchases in the 1990s.</P>

<P>Applicant was never arrested during his period of illegal substance abuse.</P>

<P>He has never undergone any drug treatment or rehabilitation as a result of his substance abuse.</P>

<P>Applicant has been with his current employer since August 1985.  The quality of his performance has not been revealed.</P>

<P><STRONG><U>POLICIES</U></STRONG></P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Factors) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual's
eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Factors).</P>

<P>An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision -- an expansion of the factors set forth in
Section F.3. of the Directive, are intended to assist the Administrative Judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P>

<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an
Administrative Judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P>

<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P>

<P><STRONG>[Drug Involvement - Criterion H]: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to
protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized
disclosure of classified information.</STRONG></P>

<P>Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering:</P>

<P>(a) drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis,
depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and</P>

<P>(b) inhalants and other similar substances.</P>

<P>Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P>

<P>(1) any drug abuse (see above definition);</P>

<P>(2) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution;</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P>

<P>(3) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.</P>

<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount determinant, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="96-0862.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest."  For the purposes
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded that both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have endeavored to draw
only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have attempted to avoid drawing inferences
that are grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the Government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the Government
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient
to overcome the doubts raised by the Government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue
the applicant's clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that the Government must
be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's loyalty and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865
specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than loyalty and patriotism.  Nothing in this
Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's loyalty or
patriotism.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT SIZE="-1">CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts and factors,
including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">With respect to Criterion H, the Government has established its case.  Applicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, including the purchase, possession, and use
of marijuana and hashish, is of concern, especially in light of his desire to have access to the nation's secrets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Applicant did not simply experiment, while a teenager, out of curiosity, and stop.  Instead, motivated by social pleasures, notwithstanding the legal status of his
endeavor, he exhibited a pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, and immature behavior, and continued his substance abuse of marijuana for
approximately fifteen years, and abuse of hashish for approximately ten years.  In fact, he was thirty-three years old when he finally stopped abusing marijuana. 
Applicant placed his drug-induced social pleasures above his potential fiduciary responsibilities towards the Government and the drug laws.  As stated above,
improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Applicant's actions
have seemingly answered those questions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes are significant factors in the overall adjudicative process.  Despite a period of
polysubstance abuse which lasted for ten years, and single substance abuse which lasted another five years, Applicant has not undergone any drug awareness,
education, or treatment program, in order to achieve a better self-understanding of the behavioral and psychological effects of his actions and the motivation
therefor.  Likewise, simply superficially claiming that peer pressure and curiosity were initial motivators, and continued enjoyment and social pleasures were
eventual motivators, does not demonstrate true insight into the actual motivation for following the fifteen year course of conduct which he had chosen. 
Furthermore, while Applicant's period of abstinence may have continued for nine months to the close of the record, it was only during the past six months that
the abstinence was based upon a conscious decision to cease his substance abuse.  Without answers to these important questions, as well as the development of
counter measures to the resumption of substance abuse -- relapse prevention, the likelihood of recurrence becomes greater.  It becomes even greater, still, when
Applicant continues to associate with others of questionable behavior -- those friends who remain substance abusers.<A HREF="96-0862.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In this instance, especially in light of Applicant's changing commentary regarding future intentions, and the length of his period of substance abuse, I believe
that both the successful completion of a drug treatment and rehabilitation program, as well as continued abstinence, for a period longer than the current nine
months, should be required to demonstrate the truly successful transformation from substance abuser to an abstinent, drug-free person, and to provide the basis
for a conclusion that such conduct will not continue or recur in the future.  While his actual substance abuse may have ceased nine months ago, his declared
motivation to abstain has only been so stated for the past six months.  Under the evidence presented, I possess little confidence that Applicant's substance abuse
is a thing of the past, or that it will not recur.  This is not to infer that I do not believe Applicant's declared intention of continued abstinence, for he has
exhibited a laudable candor.  However, even with good intentions, more time is simply necessary.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">I do not take this position lightly, but based on the law, as set forth in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan,</EM> 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my evaluation of the evidence, my
application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under Enclosure 2 of the Directive, I believe that
Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the Government's case.  The evidence leaves me with grave questions and doubts as to Applicant's continued
security eligibility and suitability.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.e. of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not suitable for access to classified information.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT SIZE="-1">FORMAL FINDINGS</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Paragraph 1. Criterion H:   AGAINST THE APPLICANT</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Subparagraph 1.a.:  Against the Applicant</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Subparagraph 1.b.:  Against the Applicant</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Subparagraph 1.e.:  Against the Applicant</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT SIZE="-1">DECISION</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance
for Applicant.</FONT></P>
