<P>Applicant, a 40-year-old employee of a federal contractor, admitted to criminal activity occurring mostly in 1994.  Mitigating factors included extreme 
emotional pressures because of the illness and death of her grandmother (and adoptive mother).  There were continuing family illnesses and deaths.  As the 
conduct was not recent and because Applicant has established an exemplary work record over the past three years, she has demonstrated rehabilitation and 
therefore, successfully mitigated the security concerns over her criminal conduct.  Clearance is granted.</P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On November 9, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR alleged facts 
under Guideline J (criminal conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. </P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated December 27, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR, and requested a decision without a hearing.  
Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material (FORM) in support of the Government's preliminary decision, a copy of which was received by 
Applicant on March 7, 2005.  Applicant was afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation by April 6, 
2005.  Applicant responded by submitting a two-page letter, dated April 13, 2005, with two letters of recommendation attached.   The case was  assigned to me 
on May 12, 2005.</P>

<P>The 1994 shoplifting offenses occurred more than 7 years prior to the signing of her security clearance application and are not required to be reported on the SF

<P>In her response to the SOR she gave the following history.  Applicant's mother died when Applicant was 12 years old.  Applicant lived with her grandmother 
from the age of 2, who adopted her when her mother died.  She had no contact with her father who is deceased.  Beginning in the early 1990s, Applicant's 
grandmother was diagnosed with cancer.  Applicant moved her into her home to care for her.  Her grandmother fought the disease for a number of five years 
with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and finally died in 1997.  During this time, Applicant was raising a young child, working full-time, and 
caring for her grandmother.  She became stressed and suffered from migraine headaches.  She sought medical assistance and became dependent on anti-depressants, Valium, and pain medication.  Her doctor was over prescribing her medications and he was later disciplined by state authorities.  During the late 
1990s her partner's sister developed a brain tumor, and she helped care for her three children.  The sister died in 2000, and one month later, one of the deceased 
sister's daughters died from a blood clot at age 15.  In the past few years, Applicant has recovered from her periods of depression and grief, and for the past 
three years she has been an exemplary employee.<A HREF="03-16801.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN> </P> 
<P>One of Applicant's supervisors stated: "Applicant has overcome many obstacles through her ingenuity, determination, and excellent attitude.<A HREF="03-16801.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P> <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">  POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[No] one has a 'right' to a security clearance."<A HREF="03-16801.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN>  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the authority to...control access to information bearing on 
national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position...that will give that person access to such 
information."<A HREF="03-16801.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN>  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history 
affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom 
from conflicting allegiances and potential coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing use, handling, and protection of classified 
information."<A HREF="03-16801.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Eligibility for a security clearance may be adjudicated using the  security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the 
applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or 
presence of rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  </P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="03-16801.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN>  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven 
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.<A HREF="03-16801.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="03-16801.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN>  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="03-16801.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has 
access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a 
compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as 
his or his own.  The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for 
access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="03-16801.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than 
actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial 
security decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security 
clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the SOR allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here 
are those conditions listed under Guideline J (criminal conduct), Directive,&para; E2.A10.1.1. <EM>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a 
person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence,  and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline J.  Applicant admitted the three convictions listed in the SOR, and the facts of the deferred 
prosecution case. Directive &para; E2.A10.1.2.1. <EM>Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless whether the person was formally charged</EM> applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The criminal conduct mitigating conditions include Directive &para; E2.A10.1.3.1. <EM>(The criminal behavior was not recent.)</EM>  Three of the incidents are nearly 12 
years old.  The other is 6 years old.  The criminal conduct is not recent.  A derivative of Directive &para; E2.A10.1.3.3. <EM>(The pressures causing the acts are no longer 
present in that person's life</EM>) also applies.  It is an extremely emotional experience to care for and watch the only person that provided love and support die, 
while trying to care for one's own child and work full time.  These factors coupled with drug dependency for depression provides a rational explanation for 
Applicant's conduct.  The impact of the dependency issues is lessened by the fact her physician was over prescribing her medication.  Those pressures are no 
longer in Applicant's life as they were confined to the period of approximately 1992 through 2000 to 2001.  Another mitigating condition to consider is 
Directive &para; E2.A10.1.3.6. <EM>(There is clear evidence of rehabilitation.)  </EM> Applicant's supervisor has indicated that she has overcome her past problems and is a 
valued employee.  Applicant has demonstrated great determination in moving ahead with her life.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guideline. 
I have also considered the whole person concept as contemplated by the Directive in &para; 6.3. A fair and commonsense assessment of the positive information 
about Applicant's history, her truthfulness, her mitigating circumstances, and her determination to overcome her obstacles do not raise reasonable doubts about 
Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts 
its interests.  I reach this conclusion because the mitigating conditions outweigh the disqualifying conditions as they are more recent in time and Applicant is 
demonstrating an ability to cope with her surroundings in an appropriate manner.  I conclude the record evidence shows Applicant has successfully mitigated 
the information supporting the government's decision, and she should be granted  access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
