</P>

<P>	On April 11, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent
with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied
or revoked.</P>

<P>	The SOR is attached.</P>

<P>______________</P>

<P>*The Applicant's first name is                               (Transcript (TR) at page 78 lines 1~7).</P>

<P>	Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on May 1, 1997.</P>

<P>	The case was received by the undersigned on June 26, 1997.  A notice of hearing was issued
on July 2, 1997, and the case was heard on July 31, 1997.  The Government submitted documentary
evidence, and called one witness to testify.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant.  The transcript
was received on August 11, 1997.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's drug
involvement and alcohol consumption militate against the granting of a security clearance.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents
and the live testimony.  The Applicant is 37 years of age, has two years of a college education, and
is employed by a defense contractor as an electronics technician.  He currently has no security
clearance, but his employer seeks a secret security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</P>

<P><U>Criterion H - Drug Involvement</U></P>

<P>	1.a.~1.c. and 1.x.  The Applicant used <STRONG>marijuana</STRONG>, with varying frequency, from about May
of 1974 to about January of 1988, and then, again, from about January of 1995 until September 10,
1996.  Twice in 1977, he laced his marijuana with PCP (TR at page 39 lines 9~16).  "In the early
'80s and through the mid '80s, . . . [he used marijuana] once or twice a month" (TR at page 15 lines
12~16).  From 1986 through 1987, his frequency of usage increased "to two to three times a week"
(TR at page 15 lines 17~20).  After seven years of absolutely no drug abuse, the Applicant began
to use marijuana in 1995.  At first this usage was "once every couple of weeks" until August, when
it increased to "two to three times a week up until about November of '95" (TR at page 16 lines
3~9).  His usage then tapered off to "once a week" through to September 10, 1996 (TR at page 16
lines 10~18).</P>

<P>	During both  periods of his usage, the Applicant purchased marijuana on numerous occasions
(TR at page 16 line 25 to page 19 line 6).  He also sold marijuana for profit in 1996.  The Applicant
estimates that he sold a total of two ounces of marijuana for $300.  His purchase price was $150 (TR
at page 17 line 7 to page 20 line 13).</P>

<P>	1.d~1.f.  The Applicant used <STRONG>methamphetamine</STRONG>, with varying frequency, from about
February of 1981 to about December of 1987, and then, again, from about January of 1996 until
August 31, 1996.  In 1987, he began to use the drug "approximately twice a month [in April] and
progressed to pretty much nearly a daily use by the end of 1987" (TR at page 21 lines 3~24).  In
1996, his usage was about twice a month in January and February, once a week in March through
ay, and by August the Applicant was using methamphetamine on a daily basis (TR at page 21 line
25 to page 22 line 18).</P>

<P>	The Applicant purchased methamphetamine, on numerous occasions, during the periods of

lines 2~14).</P>

<P>	1.g. and 1.h.  The Applicant used <STRONG>cocaine</STRONG>, with varying frequency, from about July of 1983
to about December of 1987, and then, again, from about December of 1995 until August 31, 1996. 
During the summer of 1987, he was using cocaine once a week (TR at page 26 lines 12~15).  During
the second period of his usage, from December of 1995 through January of 1996, the Applicant "was
using it at least once a week" (TR at page 27 lines 6~13).  From February until his last usage in
August, he only used cocaine three times (TR at page 27 lines 14~20).  The Applicant purchased
cocaine a total of four times (TR at page 28 lines 1~17).</P>

<P>	1.h.~1.j.  The Applicant used <STRONG>LSD</STRONG>, with varying frequency, from about December of 1977
to about June of 1983, and then, again, in August of 1996.  During the first period of his usage, he
used the drug about 20 times (TR at page 28 lines 18~23).  He also used LSD twice in August of
1996 (TR at page 29 lines 9~12).  The Applicant purchased the drug on numerous occasions (TR at
page 29 line 19 to page 30 line 14), and sold LSD "two or three times" during March and April of
1978 (TR at page 30 line 15 to page 31 line 5).</P>

1984, he was also arrested for burglary, and for criminal mischief (Government Exhibit (GX) 5). 
The Applicant had used psilocybin mushrooms prior to this arrest (TR at page 41 lines 6~16).  He
also purchased this "hallucinogen" on three occasions, and sold this drug once (TR at page 35 line
3 to page 36 line 2, and page 36 lines 6~13).</P>

<P>	1.r.~1.t.  The Applicant used<STRONG> hashish/hashish oil</STRONG>, with varying frequency, in 1981 (TR at

page 37 lines 1~6, and 12~20).</P>

<P>	1.u.~1.w.  The Applicant used <STRONG>Quaaludes</STRONG> "a few times" in 1981~82 (TR at page 37 line 21
to page 38 line 2).  He purchased this drug "three times," and sold it once (TR at page 38 lines
11~19, and page 38 line 20 to page 39 line 8).</P>

<P>	1.y.~1.aa.  The Applicant used <STRONG>amphetamine</STRONG>, "two or three times a week," during April and

(TR at page 73 lines 15~21).</P>

<P>	Considering all of the evidence, and in light of the fact that the Applicant's extensive drug
and alcohol abuse; the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion in demonstrating his suitability
for security clearance access.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER>
</U></P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 and Section F.3. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and
conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration
in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions<FONT FACE="Times"> should be followed in every case
</FONT>according to the pertinent criterion, however, the conditions<FONT FACE="Times"> are neither automatically determinative
</FONT>of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own
common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and
circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions exhaust the realm of human
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</P>

<P><CENTER><U>Drug Involvement</U></CENTER>
</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could raise a security concern</U>:</P>

<P>	(1) any drug abuse (drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner
that deviates from approved medical direction);</P>

<P>	(2) illegal drug possession . . . purchase, sale . . . .</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</U>:</P>

<P>	(3) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future;</P>

<P>	(4) satisfactory completion of a drug treatment program prescribed by a credentialed medical
professional.</P>

<P><CENTER><U>Alcohol Consumption</U></CENTER>
</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could raise a security concern</U>:</P>

<P>	(1) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,
fighting . . . or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use;</P>

<P>	(3) diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence;</P>

<P>	(5) consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed
medical professional and following completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program.</P>

<P><U>Condition that could mitigate security concerns</U><FONT FACE="Times">:</FONT></P>

<P>	(3) positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety;</P>

<P>	As set forth in the Directive,"[each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common
sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the
pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</P>

<P>		a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding
circumstances.</P>

<P>		b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P>

<P> 		c. Age of the applicant.</P>

<P>		d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct
was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of
the consequence involved.</P>

<P>		e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P>

<P>		f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in
the future."</P>

<P>	The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have
a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or
conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</P>

<P>	The Government must make out a <U>prima</U> <U>facie</U> case under criterion H (drug involvement), and
criterion G (alcohol consumption); which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability
and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's
adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to
sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</P>

<P>	Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,
explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct, is unlikely
to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</P>

<P>	Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment,
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of
classified information due to carelessness.  The improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises
questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  The
Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide
by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated
a lack of respect for the law in his private affairs, then there exists the possibility that an applicant
may demonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and regulations.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Considering first the Applicant's extensive past drug abuse, his most recent period of
admitted extensive abuse spans a period of nearly two years.  It culminated with his diagnosed
addiction to both methamphetamine and cannabis in September of 1996, less than a year ago.  This
was also the third time the Applicant was diagnosed as suffering from some form of chemical
dependency.  The first time was in December of 1987, and the next time in May of 1996.  It is also
noteworthy that despite nearly seven years of being "clean and sober" from January of 1988 to
January of 1995, the Applicant reverted to his past dependency (TR at page 46 lines 11~17). 
Although it now appears that the Applicant intends no future drug abuse, it is too soon to say that
his fairly recent addiction is not of present security significance.</P>

<P>	Much the same can be said of the Applicant's past alcohol abuse.  He was most recently
diagnosed in September of 1996 as suffering from Alcohol Dependence.  Although it now appears
he is on the road to sobriety, it is again too soon to say his fairly recent dependency is not of present
security significance.</P>

<P>	Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's <U>prima</U> <U>facie</U>
case regarding his drug involvement and alcohol abuse.  The Applicant has thus not met the
mitigating conditions of Criteria H and G, and of Section F.3. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has
not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Criteria H and G.</P>
