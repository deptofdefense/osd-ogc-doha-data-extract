</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 17, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on August 24, 2005, and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant received the File of Relevant Material (FORM) on  November 22, 
2005.  Applicant was afforded 30 days in which to respond to the FORM. Applicant did not respond to the FORM.  The case was assigned to me January 6, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline C, Applicant is alleged to (a) exercise dual citizenship with Brazil and the  U.S. and (b) possess a Brazilian passport, as of May 2005, that was issued in January 2002, and is not 
scheduled to expire before January 2007.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under</SPAN> Guideline B, Applicant is alleged  (a) to have a sister who is resident of Brazil, (b) to have a mother-in-law and brother-in-law who are citizens and residents of Brazil, (c) to have approximately 
three of his aunts, three of his uncles, and seven of his cousins who reside in brazil, and (d) to have traveled to Brazil in at least December 2000, December 2002, December 2003, and December 2004.  </P> 
 
<P>For his response to the SOR, Applicant admits each of the allegations. He provides no explanations.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant is a 33-year old senior specialist engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a  security clearance.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by 
reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant was born in the U.S. and is a U.S. Citizen by birth.  He was raised by his Brazilian parents in Brazil for most of his life.  Specifically, he resided in Brazil from 1973 through 1982 and from 
1984 through 1999 (items 4 and 5).  </P> 
 
<P>Both of Applicant's parents hold Brazilian citizenship and reside in the U.S.  Because his parents were citizens of Brazil at the time of his birth, Applicant became entitled to Brazilian citizenship 
through his parents regardless of his U.S. citizenship by birth.  Applicant has and continues to maintain dual citizenship with Brazil.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant received his undergraduate training in Brazil in 1999 while a resident of Brazil.  He worked for a Brazilian company between 1996 and July 1999 to supplement his income while a university 
student.  Applicant immigrated to the U.S. in 1999 and studied advance engineering at a recognized American university.  He received his masters degree from this same university in March 2001 (<EM>see</EM> 
item 4).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has immediate and extended family members, as well as friends, residing in Brazil.  To facilitate travel back and forth to Brazil to visit his family members and friends, he obtained a Brazilian 
passport in February 2002 (ex. 4).  He used the passport to travel to Brazil and back to see his immediate and extended family members and friends in December 2000, December 2002, December 2003, 
and December 2004. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant married in 1999 while he was still a student in Brazil.  W is of Brazilian descent  and has family members who are citizens and residents of Brazil.  His wife is a U.S. resident with U.S. 
resident alien status who resides with Applicant in the U.S.; she retains her Brazilian citizenship and has no known intention of seeking U.S. citizenship. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has expressed no intention of surrendering his Brazilian passport and assures he has no intention of relinquishing his Brazilian citizenship (<EM>see</EM> ex. 8).  He indicates he is not currently 
employed by any Brazilian agencies, has no property in Brazil, has not voted in any Brazilian elections, has not served in the Brazilian military, and has no professed loyalty to any government other 
than the U.S.  (<EM>see</EM> items 5, 6 and 8).  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant maintains regular contact with his immediate family members who are citizens and residents of Brazil (<EM>i.e., </EM>his sister, mother-in-law, father-in-law, three aunts, and three uncles).  He also 
maintains regular contact with seven of his cousins and nine friends, all of whom maintain Brazilian citizenship and residence (<EM>see</EM> exs. 6 and 7).  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has had no contact with the Brazilian government, and to the best of his knowledge, none of his immediate or extended family members have had any relationship with Brazilian officials or 
agents, with the exception of one of his uncles (<EM>see</EM> exs. 5 and 6).  This uncle is retired from the Brazilian navy and is currently in his 70s.  Applicant does not know whether this uncle has any contact 
with Brazilian government officials or agents.  </P> 
 
<P>True enough, Applicant provides few background details about his family members.  While he himself may have no knowledge of any familial relationships or contacts with Brazilian officials or agents, 
possibilities exist that all or some of them may have worked for or had contact with  Brazilian government officials in the past or present.  Absent information in the file to establish some likelihood of 
familial relationships or contacts with Brazilian government officials or agents, Applicant's disclaimers are enough to demonstrate the absence of any realistic likelihood of such relationships and/or 
contacts.</P> 
 
<P>Brazil is a charter member of the Organization of American States and an historical economic trading partner of the U.S.  Brazil has a democratic government and is generally reputed to be committed to 
the rule of law and the upholding of human rights.  The FORM does not contain any State Department publications addressing the economic/political status and human rights record of Brazil.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to 
consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or 
not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant 
Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E2..2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Preference</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that 
are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including co-habitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or are obligation <EM>are 
not</EM> citizens of the United States <EM>or may </EM>be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with 
citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> 
<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of 
an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences 
which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing to the 
applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has 
actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his or her 
security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant presents as a conscientious senior specialist engineer for a defense contractor who after being born in the U.S., was raised in Brazil, before immigrating to the U.S. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">in 1999 to pursue his 
graduate education.  Claiming the need for a Brazilian passport to facilitate his visits to Brazil to see his immediate and extended family members, he applied for and obtained a Brazilian  
passport in 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Dual citizenship concerns necessarily entail country allegiance assessments and invite critical considerations over acts indicating a preference or not for the interests of the foreign country over the 
interests of the U.S.  In a different vein, the continued residence of his immediate family members(his sister) and extended family members and friends, as well as his wife's immediate family members, 
in Brazil  raises potential concerns about their being vulnerable to future pressure or duress that could result in the compromise of classified information.  The issues, as such, raise concerns over 
Applicant's preference for a foreign country over the U.S. and the potential for members of Applicant's immediate and extended family and friends being placed at risk to pressure or duress to induce 
Applicant to divulge classified information he might be privy to.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><STRONG>Foreign Preference</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>By virtue of his birth in the U.S. to parents of Brazilian descent and citizenship, Applicant was endowed with Brazilian citizenship through his parents.  This citizenship could not be lost except by<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
express renunciation, approved by the Brazilian government, which Applicant has never visibly explored. To the contrary, four years ago he applied for and received a Brazilian passport (an active 
exercise of dual citizenship).  He has since used the passport on at least four occasions to travel back and forth to Brazil on family-related matters and  has pledged to retain it.  </SPAN>Risks of his being taken 
hostage behind Brazilian lines and denied the customary diplomatic intercession made available to U.S. citizens traveling on U.S. passports cannot be discounted, even without the availability of  
country threat risks assigned Brazil by the U.S. State Department.</P> 
 
<P>Historically, the Appeal Board has tended to blur  convenience/force of law distinctions when appraising legal necessity passport usage in multiple return to country situations (as here).  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case 
No. 99-0424 (February 8, 2001); ISCR Case No. 99-0254 (February 16, 2000).  Exercise of choice to take out and retain his Brazilian passport out of desire to preserve his options when traveling to 
Brazil to see his family and friends is itself a voluntary election, not a submission to legal compulsion.  By applying for and obtaining a Brazilian passport, Applicant displayed a conscious preference 
for Brazil, even if it was for perfectly logical and understandable reasons: wanting to see his immediate and extended family members and friends. </P> 
 
<P>So, even Applicant's limited exercise of dual citizenship is sufficient under the facts of this case to invoke Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A3.1.2.1 (<EM>The exercise of dual citizenship</EM>) and E2.A3.1.2.2 
(<EM>Possession and/or use of a foreign passport</EM>) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for foreign preference.  Further DoD policy clarifications have made the use and/or possession of a foreign passport a <EM>per se</EM> 
basis for denying or suspending a security clearance under the clarifying provisions of the memorandum of August 16, 2000 authored by the Asst SecDef forC<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 9pt">3</SPAN>I ("the ASDC3i memorandum")(<EM>see</EM> item 
9), unless the foreign passport is surrendered, or the Applicant obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the U.S. Government. Nothing in the <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ASDC3i memorandum on foreign 
passports indicates that possession of a foreign passport may be extenuated or mitigated by an applicant's showing of personal inconvenience and delay typically encountered in utilizing the visa process 
involved with travel abroad on a U.S. passport. DOHA's Appeal Board has construed the ASDC3i memorandum to be legally binding on DOHA administrative judges and the Board.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case 
No. 02-07625 (May 2004).  Neither judges nor</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Board retain jurisdiction to review or pass judgment on the wisdom or desirability of the ASDC3i memorandum.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-04237 
(August 2003).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Concerns over continued Applicant preference for Brazil are considerable for so long as he retains his Brazilian passport and dual Brazilian citizenship.  With unsettled questions still very much in 
evidence about Applicant's reluctance to take any bold steps towards surrender of his Brazilian passport and renunciation of his Brazilian citizenship, too many preference questions loom at the present 
time to credit Applicant with satisfying the heavy mitigation burden imposed on applicants by the Appeal Board.</P> 
 
<P>Considering all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant's dual citizenship exercise and  absence of meaningful mitigation efforts, conclusions warrant that Applicant exhibited active dual citizenship 
by his taking out a Brazilian  passport.  In so doing, he has demonstrated a preference for Brazil that has not been mitigated by documented surrender of the passport and expressed intentions to renounce 
his dual Brazilian citizenship.  Such firm Applicant commitments are required to satisfy expressed Appeal Board burden requirements when it comes to successfully discounting residual security risks 
that exist with his continued exercise of dual Brazilian citizenship.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b of Guideline C. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Besides foreign preference concerns, the Government finds security risks associated with (a) Applicant's wife being a citizen of Brazil and (b) his immediate family members (<EM>i.e., </EM>sister) and his 
extended family members (<EM>i.e., </EM>his mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, three aunts, three uncles and seven cousins) and friends (nine of them) residing in Brazil.  Although Applicant's ties to his 
wife's parents and siblings do not appear to be particularly close, he communicates with them often enough to invite application of Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1  (<EM>An immediate family 
member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>).</P> 
 
<P>The Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate <EM>per se</EM> results or mandate particular outcomes for any chosen set of guidelines covering risks of foreign influence.  What is 
considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country may not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available 
for referencing.  Personnel security assessments continue to be governed by the same Change 4 requirements of the Directive for appraising the security risks associated with the individual's having 
family abroad, which include both common sense assessments of country risks and information available from public sources.</P> 
 
<P>So, under these adjudicative guidelines, while an applicant with immediate family domiciled in a hypothetical hostile country might pose a risk of a hostage situation, he might conversely be able to 
neutralize material risks of exploitation of immediate and/or extended family members residing in a friendly country.  Based on known data about Brazil, Brazil would appear to provide an acceptable 
political environment for avoiding potential risks of coercion, exploitation, or pressure of a family member or friend.  Reasonable conclusions can, accordingly,  be reached that Applicant's immediate 
and extended family members and friends are not in a position to be exploited by Brazilian authorities.</P> 
 
<P>While the foreign influence provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines are ostensibly neutral as to the character of the subject country, they should not be construed to ignore the geopolitical aims and 
policies of the particular foreign regime involved.  Brazil is a constitutional republic, governed by executive and legislative branches whose leadership is conditioned on adherence to the rule of law and 
respect for human rights.</P> 
 
<P>Because Brazil is a constitutional democracy with a secure infrastructure and track record for respecting human rights and the rule of law, the risk of a pressure or influence situation involving an 
immediate, extended family member, or friend of Applicant's can be safely discounted, notwithstanding his preference for the country.  Potential foreign influence concerns are sufficiently mitigated to 
permit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of exploitation and pressure attributable to his familial relationships and contacts with his immediate and extended family 
members and friends domiciled  in Brazil.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 2.a through 2.e of Guideline B. </P>
