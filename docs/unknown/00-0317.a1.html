  Given Applicant's statements that he would be willing to bear arms for a specific foreign country, it was arbitrary and capricious for Judge to not apply Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition 3.  An applicant's willingness to bear arms for a foreign country raises serious  security concerns.  An expression of a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country, coupled with an expressed desire to remain neutral if the  United States were ever to find itself in conflict with that foreign country, raises serious questions about Applicant's preferences vis-a-vis the United  States and that foreign country.  Judge erred by analyzing Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 only in terms of whether a foreign country might  seek to apply coercive means of pressure or influence to Applicant's family members in a foreign country.  Judge erred by relying on Section 2-403 of DoD Regulation 5200.2-R.  Favorable decision reversed.</P>

<P>Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley issued a decision, dated October 31, 2001, in which he concluded it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Department Counsel appealed.  For the reasons set forth below, the Board 
reverses the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge's favorable conclusions concerning Guideline C 
(Foreign Preference) are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge's favorable conclusions concerning 
Guideline B (Foreign Influence) are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated June 21, 2001.  The SOR was based on 
Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline C (Foreign Preference).  A hearing was held on September 21, 2001.  The Administrative Judge  
issued a written decision in which he concluded it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.  The case is before the Board on Department Counsel's appeal from the Judge's favorable decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether 
there is factual or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and 
identify how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> 
ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact 
are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary 
evidence.  In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's 
findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case 
No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR 
Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Administrative Judge's Findings and Conclusions</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was born and raised in a foreign country (FC 1) by parents who are FC 1 citizens.  Applicant performed compulsory military service in 
FC 1.  Applicant later emigrated to the United States in 1976 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1987.</P> 
 
<P>The only time Applicant traveled to FC 1 was in 1984 to visit his family.  Applicant allowed his FC 1 passport to expire and he does not currently 
hold an FC 1 passport or any other foreign passport, and he has no intention of acquiring one.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant owns no land in FC 1 and has no foreign business interests in FC 1.  Applicant does not believe he is entitled to receive any benefits 
from FC 1, and he has no intention of returning to FC 1.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant would not want to take up arms for the United States against FC 1, but he cannot conceive of the United States and FC 1 ever being 
adversaries of each other.  Applicant would not take up arms against the United States for FC 1 and would defend U.S. interests whenever he 
was called upon.  Applicant would be willing to bear arms for FC 1 if it were not in a confrontation or conflict with the United States.</P> 
 
<P>Since becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant has maintained irregular contacts with his parents and other relatives living in FC 1 and another foreign 
country (FC 2), and he does not provide them with any financial assistance.  Applicant assures that he has no reason to believe that any of his 
family or relatives are vulnerable to coercion or pressure.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's father was a high-ranking officer in the FC 1 military, but retired more than 17 years ago.  Applicant's father is in no known position to 
be pressured or coerced by FC 1 authorities.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has demonstrated that his preference is for the United States because: (a) since becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, he has not exercised 
any privileges associated with FC 1 citizenship, and has demonstrated firm support of the United States and its institutions; (b) he holds no 
property or financial interests in FC 1; (c) Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="00-0317.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> applies;  (d) he is a dedicated and trustworthy defense 
contractor; and (e) his love of FC 1 does not fall under Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition 9.<A HREF="00-0317.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Favorable conclusions are warranted with 
respect to the allegations covered by Guideline C.</P> 
 
<P>Because Applicant's parents reside in FC 1, their status raises security concerns under Guideline B.  Investigative requirements under Department 
of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R refer to security risks associated with an individual having family ties in a foreign country whose interests are 
inimical to the interests of the United States.  Although the Adjudicative Guidelines pertaining to Guideline B (Foreign Preference) are ostensibly 
neutral as to the character of the foreign country involved, the Adjudicative Guidelines should not be construed to ignore the geopolitical aims and 
policies of the particular foreign regime involved.  FC 1 is not considered to be a hostile country.  Furthermore, FC 1 has a considerable history of 
stable democratic institutions and no history of exerting pressure or influence to compromise the security interests of the United States.  
Accordingly, Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="00-0317.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> applies.  The presence of Applicant's immediate family members in FC 1 does not present 
any potential risk of a hostage situation, and it poses an acceptable security risk.  Favorable conclusions are warranted with respect to the 
allegations covered by Guideline B.</P> 
 
<P>It is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P>

</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's favorable conclusions concerning Guideline C (Foreign Preference) are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to 
law</SPAN>.  Department Counsel contends the Administrative Judge's favorable conclusions concerning Guideline C are erroneous because: (a) the Judge 
failed to address SOR paragraph 1.b. as amended at the hearing; (b) the Judge erred by failing to apply Foreign Preference Disqualifying 
Condition 3<A HREF="00-0317.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>; and (c) the Judge failed to give due consideration to the security significance of Applicant's willingness to bear arms for FC 1.</P> 
 
<P>(a) In the SOR, paragraph 1.b. read as follows: "You would not bear arms for the United States against [FC 1]."  At the hearing, Department 
Counsel moved to amend SOR paragraph 1.b. to read as follows: "You are willing to bear arms for [FC 1]."  The motion to amend was granted 
by the Administrative Judge and Applicant was given the opportunity to explain his response to the amended SOR paragraph 1.b.  <EM>See</EM> Hearing 
Transcript at pp. 60-68.  In the written decision, the Judge discussed the evidence concerning Applicant's position on what he might do if there 
were a conflict between the United States and FC 1.  <EM>See</EM> Administrative Judge's Decision at pp. 3, 6.  Department Counsel persuasively argues 
that the Judge's findings and conclusions focused on the original, unamended SOR paragraph 1.b. and failed to address the amended SOR 
paragraph 1.b., apart from a passing reference in one sentence.</P> 
 
<P>(b) Given Applicant's statements that he would be willing to bear arms for FC 1, it was arbitrary and capricious for the Administrative Judge to not 
apply Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition 3.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Section 6.3 (noting that pertinent provisions of Adjudicative Guidelines  must 
be considered).</P> 
 
<P>(c) A person who is willing to bear arms for a country demonstrates a willingness to risk life and limb for that country.  Such a willingness is strong 
evidence of a profound, deeply personal commitment to the interests and welfare of that country.  A person who is willing to bear arms for a 
country may be willing to perform other acts (which do not entail risk to life and limb) to advance the interests and welfare of that country and its 
armed forces.  Accordingly, a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country raises serious security concerns about an applicant seeking to be 
granted access to U.S. classified information.</P> 
 
<P>The United States has a compelling interest in protecting classified information,<A HREF="00-0317.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence 
in persons granted access to classified information.<A HREF="00-0317.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Furthermore, a person granted access to classified information is in a fiduciary relationship 
with the United States.<A HREF="00-0317.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  A person who has expressed a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country has indicated a profound, deeply personal 
commitment to the interests and welfare of the foreign country that could place the person in a serious quandry if the foreign country wishes access 
to U.S. classified information that it believes would be necessary or desirable for its national security, but which the United States declines to share 
with the foreign country.  The federal government need not take the risk of waiting to see how the person with access to classified information 
would act if faced with such a quandry at some future date.<A HREF="00-0317.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Given the serious implications of a person's willingness to bear arms for a foreign country,  it was arbitrary and capricious for the Administrative 
Judge to fail to specifically address the security significance of Applicant's statements that he is willing to bear arms for FC 1.<A HREF="00-0317.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  The Judge's failure 
to do so is particularly troubling given Applicant's statement that he would want to be neutral if the United States were ever to find itself in conflict 
with FC 1.  An expression of a willingness to bear arms for FC 1, coupled with an expressed desire to remain neutral if the United States were 
ever to find itself in conflict with FC 1, raises serious questions about Applicant's preferences <EM>vis-a-vis</EM> the United States and FC 1.  Equivocal 
preferences with respect to the United States or a foreign country raise serious security concerns under the "clearly consistent with the national 
interest" standard.<A HREF="00-0317.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's favorable conclusions concerning Guideline B (Foreign Influence) are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to 
law</SPAN>.  Department Counsel contends the Administrative Judge's favorable conclusions concerning Guideline B are erroneous because: (a) the Judge 
gave undue weight to his conclusion that FC 1 is a friendly country unlikely to use coercive means against Applicant or his relatives in FC 1; and 
(b) the Judge improperly applied the provisions of Section 2-403 of Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R.</P> 
 
<P>(a) The Board has held that an Administrative Judge errs by analyzing Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 only in terms of whether a foreign 
country might seek to apply coercive means of pressure or influence to an applicant's family members in that foreign country.  Under Guideline B, 
the presence of family members in a foreign country must be evaluated both in terms of (i) possible vulnerability to coercive pressure or influence 
being brought to bear on, or through, an applicant's family members in a foreign country, and (ii) possible vulnerability to noncoercive means of 
influence being brought to bear on, or through, an applicant's family members in a foreign country.<A HREF="00-0317.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Department Counsel correctly notes the 
Judge in this case addressed the issue of possible coercive pressure or influence, but failed to address the issue of possible noncoercive influence.  
The Judge's failure to do so was arbitrary and capricious.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge's failure to address Applicant's potential vulnerability to noncoercive means of influence through his family members in 
FC 1 is significant in of itself.  The absence of such an analysis is aggravated by Applicant's acknowledged preference for FC 1 through his 
willingness to bear arms for FC 1.  Once an applicant has expressed a preference for a foreign country then the applicant's other ties to the foreign 
country are subject to greater scrutiny.<A HREF="00-0317.a1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge's assumption that FC 1 does not pose a serious security risk in the context of Guideline B because it is friendly to the 
United States ignores the historical reality that (i) relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly; (ii) even friendly 
nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters that they view as important to their vital interests or national security; 
and (iii) not all cases of espionage against the United States have involved nations that were hostile to the United States.  These historical realities 
caution against reliance on overly simplistic distinctions between "friendly" nations and "hostile" nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline B.  
oreover, any analysis that seeks to rely in part on distinctions between "friendly" nations and "hostile" nations must articulate a rational 
explanation for why the distinction is relevant when Guideline B fails to articulate such a distinction.</P> 
 
<P>(b) The Administrative Judge's reliance on Section 2-403 of Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to 
law.  Section 2-403 appears in a section of that Regulation which deals with investigations, not adjudications.  Furthermore, the silence of Section 
2-403 about non-hostage situations is not dispositive because Section 2-403 fails to address a wide variety of clearly security-significant issues.  
The Judge's reliance on Section 2-403 is patently contrary to a past Board ruling.<A HREF="00-0317.a1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  Furthermore, to interpret or construe Section 2-403 as 
setting the limits or parameters of what constitutes security-significant circumstances would have the practical effect of eviscerating and nullifying 
large portions of the Adjudicative Guidelines, a result that must be avoided in adjudicating security clearance cases.<A HREF="00-0317.a1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel has met its burden of demonstrating error below that warrants reversal.  Pursuant to Item E3.1.33.3 of the Directive's 
Additional Procedural Guidance, the Board reverses the Administrative Judge's favorable security clearance decision.</P>
