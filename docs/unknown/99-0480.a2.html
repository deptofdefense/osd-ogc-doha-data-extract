Board cannot consider new evidence offered in support of a request for  reconsideration.  Adverse effect that an unfavorable security clearance decision might have on an applicant or an applicant's family  is not relevant to determining whether the applicant is suitable person to be granted access to classified information.

<P>On November 28, 2000, the Board issued an Appeal Board Decision and Reversal Order ("Decision") in this case.  Applicant
submitted a Reconsideration Request, dated January 16, 2001 ("Request").  Applicant also submitted a document, dated January
23, 2001, in support of his Request.  On January 26, 2001, Department Counsel submitted its response to Applicant's Request.  For
the reasons that follow, the Board's November 28, 2000 Decision stands as issued.</P>

<P>The Board has the inherent authority to entertain a request to reconsider its decisions.  However, there is no right to
reconsideration; rather, the Board has the sole discretion to decide whether to exercise its authority to reconsider one of its
decisions.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0619 (December 27, 1999) at p. 1; ISCR Case No. 98-0621 (November 23, 1999) at pp. 1-2;
ISCR Case No. 96-0785 (October 5, 1998) at pp. 1-2.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Reconsideration Issues</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>Applicant makes the following arguments in support of his Request: (1) the Board's Decision adversely affected Applicant's
employment situation, his career future, and his family; (2) Applicant repeatedly offered to surrender his foreign passport to the
U.S. Government, but the Government  refused to accept it; (3) as an alternative, Applicant offered to destroy his foreign passport
or place it in certified escrow until it expires; (4) Applicant would have surrendered his foreign passport to the foreign government
that issued it if the DoD had made it clear to him that such an action was the only way to retain a security clearance; (5) many
members of the counterintelligence community question the wisdom of the surrender requirement of the ASDC3I memo; and (6)
Applicant has surrendered his foreign passport to the foreign government that issued it.</P>

<P>Department Counsel opposes Applicant's Request.  In support of its opposition, Department Counsel argues: (a) Applicant's
Request is untimely; (b) Applicant's Request is supported by new evidence that the Board cannot consider; (c) Applicant's Request
merely restates arguments that were made on appeal and were addressed by the Board in its November 28, 2000 Decision; (d)
Applicant's Request does not raise any new, legitimate issues that warrant reconsideration; and (e) the adverse effect of a Board
decision on Applicant's employment is irrelevant to a security clearance decision.</P>

<P>To date, the Board has not made any ruling as to when a motion for reconsideration is timely or untimely.  The Board declines to
do so in this case.</P>

<P>The Board's inherent authority to entertain a request to reconsider one of its decisions does not allow the Board to ignore pertinent
provisions of DoD Directive 5220.6 ("Directive").  The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive, Additional
Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  A motion for reconsideration is nothing more than an extension of an appeal because it asks
the Board to reconsider its decision in an appeal.  Accordingly, the Board need not address those arguments that Applicant makes
based on new evidence; to do otherwise would have the practical effect of violating the Directive's prohibition concerning new
evidence on appeal.</P>

<P>Applicant repeats some arguments that he raised on appeal.  The Board addressed those arguments in its November 28, 2000
Decision.  The Board concludes Applicant has failed to articulate any persuasive reason for the Board to change its resolution of
those arguments.</P>

<P>Applicant's argument that the Board's November 28, 2000 decision has an adverse effect on him and his family fails to state a
reason that would justify a different result in his case.  "In most cases, it is likely that denial or revocation of a security clearance
will have an adverse effect on an applicant's ability to retain employment with a defense contractor.  However, that possible
consequence is irrelevant to an adjudication of an applicant's security eligibility.  An applicant is not made more or less suitable for
a security clearance based on how a security clearance decision might affect the applicant."  ISCR Case No. 98-0621 (November
23, 1999) at p. 2.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0435 (September 16, 1999) at p. 2 (adverse effect that an unfavorable security
clearance decision might have on an applicant or an applicant's family is not relevant to determining whether an applicant is a
suitable person to be granted a security clearance).</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>Applicant's Request fails to set forth any persuasive reason for why the Board should change any of the rulings it made in
connection with Applicant's initial appeal.  Accordingly, the Board's November 28, 2000 Decision stands.</P>
