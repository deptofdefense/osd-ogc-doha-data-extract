<P>Applicant was convicted numerous times and also received punishment under Article 15, UCMJ. His most recent arrest occurred in 2001. When he completed 
a Security Clearance Application, he failed list all of his arrests, including a felony arrest, and failed to indicate his clearance had been revoked. The record 
evidence is insufficient to mitigate or extenuate the negative security implications stemming from his alcohol use, criminal conduct and personal conduct. 
Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 20, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-26723.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 
November 18, 2003, the Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 19, 2004, the Applicant received a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) dated January 23, 2004, and was given the opportunity 
to file objections and submit material in extenuation, mitigation, or refutation. On March 17, 2004, Applicant's response to the FORM was received. 
Department Counsel (DC) did not object to the Applicant's response. In the FORM, DC presented 15 exhibits (Items). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant submitted no exhibits. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I 
was assigned the case on March 25, 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges Alcohol, Criminal Conduct, and Personal Conduct.  The Applicant admits to the following: he was arrested in December 2001 and found 
guilty of Driving Under the Influence (DUI); he was arrested in October 1999 for assault and battery, the charge was nolle prosequi; he was arrested in October 
1992 for drinking at a football game; he received punishment under Article 15, Uniformed Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for being incapacitated to properly 
perform his duties due to overindulgence in liquor; he was arrested in April and August 1990 for Drunken Driving; he was arrested in July 1996 for assault and 
battery; he was cited in August 1995 for illegal dumping; he was arrested in June 1994 for distribution of cocaine but was acquitted; he was arrested in 
September 1992 for carrying a concealed weapon; and was cited in May 1990 for driving while his post privileges were suspended. He denies intentionally 
omitting information from his Security Clearance Application, Standard Form (SF) 86. These admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 38-years-old, has worked for a defense contractor, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began drinking beer at age 17, then consuming six beers a week. At age 18, he entered the Army and his alcohol consumption steadily increased. By 
age 20, he was drinking a case of beer over the weekends.  Following his marriage, also when he was age 20, his drinking increased to a fifth of liquor a week 
plus a case to a case and one half of beer a week. As of April 2000, Applicant said he had consumed a case of beer a week for the past ten years. (Item 5) He 
also said he had never felt he has had a drinking problem.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In April 1990, Applicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence (DUI). His post driving privileges were suspended for six months.  In May 1990, he 
received a speeding ticket on post and received punishment under Art.15 (UCMJ) for failure to obey an order for driving while his post privileges were 
suspended. He was reduced from E-5 to E-4, required to perform 30 days extra duties, restricted for 30 days, and ordered to forfeit $560 per month for two 
months.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Also, in May 1990, he was charged with assault resulting from an argument with his wife. In August 1990, he was charged with drunken driving in violation of 
Article 111 UCMJ, and using a false and unauthorized visitor's pass. (Item 9) He was reduced in rank and paid a fine. Applicant's security clearance was 
revoked. (Item 15)  In October 1991, he was informed of the action to revoke his clearance and he submitted a signed form stating he did not intend to submit a 
statement for consideration in the final adjudication. In the Fall of 1990, he underwent a two month inpatient treatment program for alcohol abuse.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 1991, Applicant received punishment under Article 15 (UCMJ) for being incapable of performing his duties due to overindulgence with alcohol. 
(Item 8) He was reduced in grade from E-4 to E-3, required to perform 14 days extra duties, and was restricted to the post for 14 days.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In September 1992, Applicant was charged with carrying a concealed weapon. (Item12)  He and a friend were stopped, in his car, on suspicion of shoplifting. 
A search of the vehicle disclosed a gun under the passenger's seat.  Applicant's uncle had put the gun there.  Applicant paid a fine. In November 1992, 
Applicant received a summons for drinking in public on school grounds at a football game.  He was fined $25. (Item 7)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In June 1994, he was arrested for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, a felony, and distribution of cocaine, a felony. He was at a softball game with a friend when 
that friend sold cocaine to an undercover agent. (Item 11) In October 1994, Applicant was acquitted of both charges. In July 1996, Applicant was charged with 
assault and battery. (Item 10)  He was involved in an argument with a former girlfriend. She hit him, he hit her. The charge was later dismissed. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 1998, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application, SF86. He answered "no" to question 21 which asked if he had ever been charged 
with or convicted of any felony offense. Applicant says he understood the question to apply only to convictions. In response to question 24, which asked him 
about his alcohol-related police record, he listed a single 1989 DUI.  He answered "no" to question 32, which asked if his clearance had ever been denied, 
suspended, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 1999, he was again charged with assault and battery. (Item 6)  He was involved in an argument with a different former girlfriend after failing to 
come home one night. He had been out drinking. An altercation occurred.  The charge was nolle prosequi when his girlfriend failed to appear in court. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In response to interrogatories (Item 14), Applicant says he last drank beer in May 2002.  He says he started Alcoholics Anonymous that month and attends 
"meetings when I can."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive.  The government has the burden of proving any 
controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts must have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against 
clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Alcohol Consumption, Guideline G, the Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to 
control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to 
alcohol use. (E2.A7.1.2.1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. Alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job. (E2.A7.1.2.2.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">5. Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment. (E2.A7.1.2.5.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None Apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal Conduct, Guideline J, the Concern: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged; </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   b. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None Apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct, Guideline E, the Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. (E2.A5.1.2.2.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None Apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." As 
Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for 
access to classified information to "United States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for 
coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Executive Order 12968, 
<EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines 
contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, then the applicant has the ultimate burden of establishing his security suitability with substantial evidence in 
explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  <EM>See </EM>Executive Orders 10865 &sect; 2 and 12968 &sect; 3.1(b). 
"Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." 
Directive &para; E2.2.2 "The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM> See Egan</EM>, 
484 U.S. at 531.  Doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Alcohol Consumption,  Guideline G.  In December 2001, the Applicant was arrested and 
convicted of DUI, in 1990 he was arrested twice for drunken driving, in 1992 he was arrested for drinking in public, and in 1991 he was incapable of 
performing his duties due to overindulgence of alcohol. Disqualifying conditions (DC) 1<A HREF="01-26723.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>, 2<A HREF="01-26723.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>, and 5<A HREF="01-26723.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the Fall of 1990, he underwent a two month inpatient treatment program for alcohol abuse.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The treatment appears to have had little positive impact for, following the treatment, Applicant was incapable of performing his duties in 1991. In 1992 he was 
charged with drinking in public at a football game and in 2001 was arrested for and later convicted of DUI.  Additionally, following his treatment in the fall of 
1990 until his statement of April 2000, Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> consumed a case of beer a week. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's conduct was serious, recent, frequent, and does establish a 
pattern. The Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the Government's case against him. 
There is no show of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety, nor </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">efforts to reform his behavior, change his friends, or lifestyle.  Applicant has a 
long and extensive alcohol history. He says he stopped drinking in May 2002, but without more, his statement of abstinence is insufficient for a favorable 
determination. Because the Applicant meets the disqualifying conditions and none of the mitigating conditions, the alcohol consumption is resolved against the 
Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Criminal Conduct, Guideline J. Under Guideline J, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history or pattern of criminal activity creating doubt about his judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. In addition to the alcohol related arrest listed above, Applicant was arrest twice for assault and battery, arrested for carrying a concealed 
weapon, and received an Art. 15 for failing to obey an order when he drove on post following the suspension of his driving privileges. Because of his these 
incidents, DC a. (Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged) and b. (A single serious crime or 
multiple lesser offenses) apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the mitigating conditions (MC) apply. MC a.(The criminal behavior is not recent)  does not apply because his most recent arrest occurred in December 
2001, which is recent criminal behavior. MC b. (The crime was an isolated incident) does not apply because there were nine related arrests or Art. 15's and 
therefore, his criminal behavior was not an isolated incident. MC c. (The person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no 
longer present in that person's life) and d. (The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur) do 
not apply because the Applicant's conduct was not the result of pressure, coercion, or an involuntary act. There was no acquittal, so MC e. (Acquittal) is 
inapplicable.  MC f. (There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation) does not apply because the record does not establish clear evidence of successful 
rehabilitation.  I find against the Applicant as to criminal conduct, SOR subparagraph 2, except for SOR subparagraph 2.c. wherein Applicant was cited for 
illegal dumping. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under guideline E, (Personal Conduct).  Under Guideline E, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when that applicant is shown to have been involved in personal conduct which creates doubt about the person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Complete honesty and candor on the part of applicants for access to classified information is essential to make an accurate and meaningful 
security clearance determination.  Without all the relevant and material facts, a clearance decision is susceptible to error, thus jeopardizing the nation's 
security. The nature of Applicant's actions, in providing false information to multiple questions on his December 1998 SF 86 poses a serious potential risk to 
the nation's security precautions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 1998, when Applicant completed an SF 86 he answered "no" to question 21, which asked if he had ever been charged with or convicted of any 
felony offense.  Applicant says he understood the question to apply only to convictions. The wording of the question does not so limit the question. His 
explanation does not mitigate his conduct because I did not believe him. In response to question 24, which asked him about his alcohol related police record, he 
listed a single 1989 DUI and failed to list his two 1990 drunken driving arrests, his 1992 arrest, and his 1994 arrest. He answered "no" to question 32, which 
asked if his clearance had ever been denied, suspended, or revoked. In October 1991, he was informed of the action to revoke his clearance and submitted a 
signed form (Item 15) stating he did not intend to submit a statement for consideration in the final adjudication. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the mitigating conditions apply to his false answers.  His alcohol and drug related arrests and revocation of clearance were pertinent to a determination 
of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. The falsifications were not an isolated incident because he gave false answers to three different questions. There is 
no showing the Applicant make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts. There is no indication his 
omissions were caused by improper or inadequate advice from authorized personnel or based on advice from legal counsel. Because of the serious nature of his 
falsifications, I find against the Applicant as to Personal Conduct, SOR subparagraph 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the 
circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P>
