</P>

<P>	On March 28, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, amended by Change 3, February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,
which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether
clearance </P>

<P>should be denied or revoked. The SOR is attached. Applicant filed his Answer to the SOR on April
23, 1997.</P>

<P>	The case was received by the undersigned on May 12, 1997. A notice of hearing was issued
on May 29, 1997, and the case was heard on June 18, 1997. The Government submitted documentary
evidence. Testimony was taken from Applicant. Applicant's post-hearing submission, containing five
character statements,  a second copy of his Answer, and a one page document with names and
telephone numbers, shall be admitted in evidence as Applicant's Exhibit A. The transcript was
received on July 3, 1997.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Following Findings of Fact are based on the documentation and testimony. The SOR
alleges criminal conduct. The following Findings of Fact are based on the record and witness
credibility. Applicant is 44 years old and employed as an administrative clerk by a defense
contractor. He seeks a secret clearance.</P>

<P>	Applicant did not file his federal tax returns for the years 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995. He did
not file his state tax returns for the same years.<A HREF="97-0233.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> Applicant knew he had an obligation to file and pay
income taxes but several extenuating events commanded Applicant's attention during the period.
First, his wife became very ill in March 1991 and the cost of her treatment quickly rose to
approximately $175,000 during the course of the year. (GE #3) Although Applicant's insurance paid
for most of the treatment, Applicant's wages were garnisheed for about $11,000 by one of  treating
hospitals. When his wife died in January 1992, Applicant became the sole provider for three minor
children. In  April 1993, his  grandson died  and Applicant had to pay for a substantial part of the
funeral expenses. In April 1994, Applicant was laid off from his job and rehired by his present
employer at a 30% reduction in salary. Finally, Applicant's residence was damaged by two floods. </P>

<P>	Applicant testified he contacted the regional federal tax agency in May 1997 to send the
appropriate tax forms so that he could file for the years in issue. He discovered the forms he received
in late May were the wrong forms because he is required to itemize his deductions. Therefore, he has
to request a new set of forms that allow itemization. (TR. 14-16) Although he stated in GE #3 he was
going to request the forms from the state and federal agencies in September 1996, he has been trying
to collect the proper paperwork between September 1996 and May 1997. (TR. 18) </P>

<P>	Applicant is trying to prepare his tax returns because he does not have the money to pay
someone to prepare his tax returns. He filed the 1990 and 1996 returns on time, but did file the other
returns because of the difficulties he encountered between 1991 and 1994.</P>

<P>	Applicant's coworker of four years has found Applicant to be a trustworthy person with much
integrity. Four other coworkers, the facility security officer,<A HREF="97-0233.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> and supervisors complimented
Applicant's security consciousness and well-organized habits at work,  and the dedication he shows
to his family. </P>

<P>	Applicant's Exhibit A also contains a one page document, dated April 22, 1997, with names,
telephone numbers, and the information sought. Apart from the document's authenticity problems,
the document definitely falls short of the documented corroboration described by Applicant in his
testimony concerning his efforts to contact the respective tax agencies. (TR. 17; 21-24)  However, 
Applicant's favorable credibility convinces me that Applicant will follow through with his intentions
to resolve all present tax problems and dutifully file and pay taxes in the future.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth policy factors which must be given binding
consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors must be considered in
every case according to the pertinent criterion; however, the factors are in no way <U>automatically</U>
<U>determinative</U> of the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance
on his own common sense. Because each security case presents its own unique facts and
circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the entire realm of human
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. In addition, the Judge, as the trier of fact,
must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Factors most pertinent to evaluation
of the facts in this case are:</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct (Criterion J)</CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P><U>Factors Against Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	2. a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. </P>

<P><U>Factors for Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	1. the criminal behavior was not recent.</P>

<P>	2. the crime was an isolated event.</P>

<P>	5. there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.</P>

<P>			<STRONG><CENTER>General Policy Factors (Whole Person Concept)</CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>Every security clearance case must also be evaluated under additional policy factors that
make up the whole person concept. Those factors (found at page 2-1 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive)
include: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the
conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the
time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; and, (8) the
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	As set forth in the Directive, every personnel security determination must be a fair and
impartial overall commonsense decision based upon all available information, both favorable and
unfavorable, and must be arrived at by applying the standard that the granting (or continuance) of
a security clearance under this Directive may only be done upon a finding that to do so is clearly
consistent with the national interest. In reaching determinations under the Directive, careful
consideration must be directed to the actual as well as the potential risk involved that an applicant
may fail to properly safeguard classified information in the future. The Administrative Judge can
only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence
of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative
or conjectural in nature.</P>

<P>	The Government must establish all the factual allegations under Criterion J (criminal
conduct) which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. While
a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his
ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to the sufficiency of proof of a
rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</P>

<P>	Then, the applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,
explanation, mitigation or extenuation which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely
to repeat itself and Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	When Applicant willfully failed to file his state and federal income taxes for 1992, 1993,
1994, and 1995, Applicant demonstrated a pattern of criminal conduct that creates doubt about his
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.<A HREF="97-0233.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> If a security clearance holder displays an irresponsible
attitude toward  his obligation to file tax returns every year, then the chances are that at some time
in the future he will display the same sort of inattentive attitude toward the rules and regulations
describing how to safeguard classified information.</P>

<P>	Even though the acts of omission did not end until 1995 and were not isolated events, there
were clearly traumatic experiences in Applicant's life which explain and also mitigate his failure to
file returns for the years in issue. An unexpected medical emergency confronted Applicant in March
1991 when his wife became seriously ill in March 1991. While most of the enormous cost of her
treatment was paid by medical insurance, Applicant's wages were garnisheed for the remaining cost 
his insurance did not cover.  After suffering the loss of his grandson in April 1993, Applicant was
laid off from his present job in April 1994 and rehired at a 30% loss in salary. The family deaths, the
concomitant emotional as well as economic toll related to the deaths, the decrease in income, and
other difficulties of raising three minor children, provide a satisfactory basis to conclude Applicant
will comply with all federal and state tax obligations in the future. </P>

<P>	Applicant's  character evidence, which stresses his devotion to his work as well as his family,
coupled  with the family medical problems and Applicant's job problems between 1991 and 1994,
convinces me Applicant's security clearance should be granted.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	After a full review of the specific policy factors set forth in POLICIES, and the general
policy factors (whole person concept), Formal Findings required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of
the Directive are:</P>

<P>		Paragraph 1 (Criminal Conduct):		FOR THE APPLICANT.</P>

<P>			a. For the Applicant.</P>

<P>			b. For the Applicant.</P>

<P>			c. For the Applicant.</P>

<P>			d. For the Applicant.</P>

<P>			e. For the Applicant.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>DECISION</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A> Applicant also discovered through his own investigation that he has not filed tax returns for
1991. Even though  his failure to file 1991 returns is not alleged in the SOR, the failure to file
constitutes additional evidence of a pattern of omission that is significant under criminal conduct.
However, the failure to file must be balanced against the extenuating circumstances surrounding his
wife's long illness.
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A> On page 17 and 24 of the transcript, Applicant described how his facility officer assisted
in helping Applicant acquire information from the tax agencies. However, in his character reference,
the facility security officer makes no mention of what actions he took in helping Applicant resolve
his tax problems.
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A> Doubt concerning Applicant's judgment is compounded by his inaction until August 1996
to take any credible action in resolving his tax problems. Conversely, Applicant's efforts in gathering
the necessary paperwork  and calling the appropriate tax officials since August 1996, represents good
judgment by Applicant to finally address his tax responsibilities.
