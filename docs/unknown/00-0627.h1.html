<P>The Applicant was less than candid as to the true extent of his past drug abuse on a May 1998 Questionnaire for National Security Positions, again in a 
November 1998 sworn statement, and for a third time in an August 1999 sworn statement.  These repeated wilful falsifications are also a violation of 18 U.S.C. 
10001.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 2, 2000, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on December 8, 2000.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on February 8, 2001.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on September 24, 2001, and Applicant's reply was received on or about October 24, 2001.  The case was 
received by the undersigned for resolution on December 30, 2002.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's repeated personal conduct and related 
criminal conduct militate against the granting of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of Relevant Material and Applicant's Response.  The Applicant is 44 years 
of age and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct &amp; Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. and 2.a.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In answering question 24 on a May 1998 Questionnaire for National Security Positions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> (QNSP), the Applicant knowingly and wilfully failed to 
disclose the full extent of his past drug abuse (Item 4 at page 8, Item 7 at page 1, and Item 8 at page 1).  He failed to disclose that he used cocaine from 
September of 1992 to September of 1996; that he used crack cocaine, at times on a daily basis, from January of 1995 to September of 1996; and that he used 
marijuana, at times monthly during 1991 (<EM>id</EM>).  This wilful falsification is a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b. and 2.a.  In a signed sworn statement, executed by the Applicant on November 17, 1998, the Applicant again knowingly and wilfully failed to disclose the 
full extent of his past drug abuse (Item 9 at pages 1~2, Item 6 at page 16, and Item 7 at pages 1~2).  He failed to disclose that he used both hashish and cocaine 
while serving in the United States Air Force from about 1997 until 1982; that he used heroin in 1985; that he used LSD from about 1985 until 1992; that he 
tested positive for cocaine and received treatment for Cocaine Dependence in 1991; that he used crack cocaine, at times on a daily basis, from January of 1995 
to September of 1996; and that he sold illegal drugs (<EM>id</EM>).  This wilful falsification is also a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c. and 2.a.  In a signed sworn statement, executed by the Applicant on August 4, 1999, the Applicant, for the third time, knowingly and wilfully failed to 
disclose the full extent of his past drug abuse (Item 5 at page 2, Item 6 at page 16, and Item 7 at pages 1~2).  This wilful falsification is a third violation of 18 
U.S.C. 1001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant explains the reason for his repeated falsifications in his answer to the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I knew employees who were discharged for not being able to obtain security clearances.  I didn't want the consequences of my previous drug usage to 
continually become a detriment to my family.  I knew my attendence(<EM>sic</EM>) to(<EM>sic</EM>) treatment facilities was documented but the uncertainty of not knowing if my 
drug usage prior to my employment would get me discharged was the sole reason for my not being forthright (Item 3 at page 3).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant offers little in the way of mitigation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2)  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . or similar form . . . ;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to and investigator . . . in connection with a personal 
security or trustworthiness determination;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Criminal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive,"[each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant 
and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out its case under Guideline E (personal conduct), and Guideline J (criminal conduct); which establishes doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to 
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal conduct is conduct involving questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  The 
Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all 
places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in his private affairs, there then exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the 
same attitude towards security rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was not truthful as to the full extent of his past drug abuse on three separate occasions: when he fill out his QNSP in May of 1998, six months 
later when he executed a sworn statement in November of 1998, and eight months after that when he executed a sworn statement in August of 1999.  It was 
only with the Government's submission of the Applicant's medical and treatment records that the full extent of the Applicant's past drug abuse came to light 
(Items 6, 7 and 8).  The Applicant has yet to admit the true extent of his drug involvement.  This lack of candor is clearly of security significance; and as such, 
Guidelines E and J are found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his personal conduct and related criminal conduct.  The Applicant 
has thus not met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines E and J, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of 
persuasion under Guidelines E and J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER>
