<P>The Applicant and the father of her child separated in 1989.  For the "first time" she was "on . . . [her] own and responsible for paying all the expenses."  The 
Applicant began to fall behind in her bills, and incurred about $8,800 in past due indebtedness.  She has now initiated a good-faith effort to repay or otherwise 
resolve all of her past due debts.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May, 1, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on or about May 23, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on August 6, 2002.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received her copy on August 12, 2002, and Applicant's Response was received on September 16, 2002.  The case was received 
by the undersigned for resolution on December 19, 2002.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's financial difficulties militate against the granting of 
a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of Relevant Material and Applicant's Response.  The Applicant is 37 years 
of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant lived with the father of her child from the age of 19 to 24 (Government Exhibit (GX) 5 at page 1).  They separated in 1989, and for the "first 
time" she was "on . . . [her] own and responsible for paying all the expenses" (<EM>id</EM>).  The Applicant began to fall behind in her bills, and incurred about $8,800 in 
past due indebtedness (GX 7).  Her past due indebtedness has now been addressed in the following manner:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  The Applicant owes $1,400 in past due indebtedness </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">to a bank (Response at page 11).  She has entered into a <STRONG>payment plan</STRONG> with the creditor by which she 
pays $45 each month on this outstanding debt (<EM>id</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b.  The Applicant owed $3,200 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in past due indebtedness </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">to second bank (GX 5 at page 6).  <STRONG>Prior to the issuance of the SOR</STRONG>, the Applicant entered into <STRONG>a 
settlement agreement</STRONG> with the creditor, and this past due debt has been <STRONG>satisfied</STRONG> (Response at pages 6~8).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c.  The Applicant owed $1,683 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in past due indebtedness </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">to a financial institution (GX 7 at page 5).  She has entered into a <STRONG>payment plan</STRONG> with the creditor by 
which she makes regular payments of $235 towards this outstanding debt (GX 6 at pages 6~7, and Response at pages 9~10).  She has reduced this debt to $706 
(Response at pages 9~10).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d.  The Applicant owes $408 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in past due indebtedness </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">to a second financial institution (GX 7 at page 4).  She is addressing this past due debt, but has yet to 
establish a payment plan (Response at page 12).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e.  The Applicant owes $53 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in past due indebtedness </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">to grocery store (GX 7 at page 5).  She is also addressing this past due debt, but has yet to establish a 
payment plan (Response at page 12).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f.  The Applicant owes $2,000 in back taxes to the IRS (GX 5 at pages 5~6).  <STRONG>Prior to the issuance of the SOR</STRONG>, she has been making <STRONG>monthly payments</STRONG> of 
$65 towards this past due indebtedness (<EM>id</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has addressed all of her past due indebtedness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion, however, 
the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own 
common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions exhaust 
the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Financial Considerations</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">6.  The individual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolved debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline F (financial considerations), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and her ability to effectively safeguard classified 
information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Government must be able to place a high 
degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the age of 24, the Applicant, for the first time, found herself on her own, financially.  As a result, she fell behind in her bills, and incurred about $8,800 in 
past due indebtedness.  She has now addressed all of this indebtedness, as required by the last mitigating condition under Financial Considerations.  Her two 
largest debts, one to a bank and the other to the IRS, were, in fact, addressed prior to the issuance of the SOR.  Her past due indebtedness has thus been cut 
almost in half to about $4,500.  As the Applicant is now on the road to financial solvency, I conclude that her past financial considerations are not of present 
security significance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding her alleged financial difficulties.  The Applicant has thus met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline F, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, she has met her ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: FOR THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. For the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>DECISION</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant.</SPAN></P>
