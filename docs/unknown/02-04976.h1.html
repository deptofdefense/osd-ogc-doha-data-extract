<P>Applicant, a 46-year-old aircraft painter, seeks a security clearance in connection with his defense contractor employment.  Applicant used marijuana at various 
times between 1974 and 2000,  and attended two drug and alcohol treatment programs after being identified by his employers' urinalysis testing program.  
However, Applicant failed to disclose this information on his security clearance application.  Applicant failed to mitigate the disqualifying conditions 
exemplified by his conduct, and did not demonstrate it was in the national interest to grant him a clearance.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On October 15, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative 
Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a signed and sworn statement, dated November 12, 2002, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  He requested his case be decided on the written 
record in lieu of a hearing. </P> 
 
<P>On March 5, 2003, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written case.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="02-04976.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN> was provided to 
the Applicant, and he was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Nothing in the record indicates 
that Applicant filed a response to the FORM by the April 24, 2003 due date.  The case was assigned to me on May 8, 2003.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c.  He denied the allegations in subparagraph 2.a. and 2.b.  Those admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 46-year-old aircraft painter employed by a defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance to be able to continue his job.  Applicant is married 
and has three children, who are not listed on his security clearance application. (Item 4 at 4; Item 5 at 5;Item 7 at 1; Item 8 at 5)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant completed his security clearance application on June 9, 2000.  On that application Applicant answered Question 27 that in the past 7 years he had not 
used any illicit drugs or substances, which included marijuana.  He also answered Question 30 on that application that in the past 7 years his use of alcoholic 
beverages had not resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or counseling.  Both answers were false because Applicant used marijuana in 1994 and now admits 
the use.  Applicant also was diagnosed as and treated for alcohol dependence<A HREF="02-04976.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> in 1995 by a recognized treatment program.  Applicant was also diagnosed in 
1995 with cannabis dependence<A HREF="02-04976.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> at the same program.  Applicant was discharged from the program he attended in 1995 for non-compliance with the program, 
to include non-attendance at the Level 2 sessions, and continued use of alcohol and marijuana. (Item 4 at 6-7; Item 9 at 5-6)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Applicant was identified in 1994 through his employer's drug testing program as a marijuana user.  Applicant admits in his statement of July 2001 that he was 
sent to the diagnosis and treatment program in 1995.  There is no evidence in the file showing Applicant voluntarily entered himself in the 1995 or 2000 
diagnosis and treatment programs.  The 1995 outpatient notes clearly show Applicant was diagnosed as chemically dependent for alcohol and cannabis.  
Applicant's evaluation was conducted by a program staff member.  (Item 6 at 1-2; Item 9 at 1-5)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Applicant was diagnosed in September 2000 by a credentialed medical professional for cannabis abuse/cannabis dependence.  This diagnosis in that 
remediation program occurred after Applicant was identified as using marijuana in a random urinalysis test conducted by his employer and was sent to the 
program.  This marijuana use, which Applicant admits, occurred after Applicant signed his security clearance application in June 2000. (Item 3 at 1; Item 7 at 1-6; Item 8 at 1-5)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Applicant admits to the use of marijuana three times.  He states he was very unlucky to be tested immediately after he used the marijuana on two of these 
occasions.  He states he only used the marijuana in 1994 and 2000 when he was in a group of people or with friends who used it and offered it to him.  The 
1995 evaluation, however, at that time, states Applicant used four "hits" of marijuana. (Item 6 at 1; Item 9 at 1)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id</EM>. At 527.The president has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States 
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, 
discretion, and sound judgement, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations 
governing he use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information </EM>Section 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicted upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be 
carefully considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(5) the voluntariness of participation; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or 
that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable 
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or 
other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  See <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  
Once the Government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts.  See Directive Para E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance.: ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent 
with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive Para. E2.2.2.  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec . Or. 12968 Section 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><STRONG>Guideline H - Drug Involvement</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(A) Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or 
dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(B) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior-altering substances and include: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(2.1) Drugs, materials and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, 
depressants. narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(2.2) Inhalants and other similar substances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(C) Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(D) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(1) Any drug abuse (see above definition).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(3) Diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional (e.g. physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(4) Evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment program. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(5) Failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by a credentialed medical professional. Recent drug involvement, especially following 
the granting of a security clearance, or an expressed intent not to discontinue use, will discontinue use, will almost invariably result in an unfavorable 
determination. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(E) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">None</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(A) Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  The following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance 
action or administrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of investigators, security officials or other official representatives in connection with a 
personal security or trustworthiness determination.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(B) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(1)The deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal 
history statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(5) A pattern of dishonesty;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">(C) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">None</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon 
an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination 
required, I can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  Likewise, I have attempted to 
avoid drawing any inferences that are based on mere speculation or conjecture.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">With respect to Guideline H, the Government established its case.  The SOR alleges Applicant used marijuana in 1974, 1994, and 2000.  Applicant was treated 
in 1995 and 2000, but even with the diagnosis of cannabis abuse, Applicant does not seem to take it to heart. I do not think that the only two times Applicant 
used marijuana, that his employers happened to test him for possible drug use and find it.  The odds of that happening are too slim to be realistic.  There was no 
evidence that Applicant did anything between 1995 and 2000, or even today, to address and remedy fully the cannabis abuse diagnosis from the 1995 treatment 
program.  Therefore, the problem likely remains unresolved.  Under Guideline H, an applicant's illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding his 
willingness to protect classified information.  I conclude Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1, 3, 4, and 5 apply here.  A security concern may exist if an applicant 
uses or purchases illegal drugs such as marijuana.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Next, I turn to the Mitigating Conditions (MC) set forth in the Directive to determine if any apply here.  After evaluating all of the evidence, I conclude none are 
applicable in this case.  The facts of this case show Applicant' s use of marijuana is recent and has actually continued over 30 years or so intermittently, at least.  
His three or four instances of use are, therefore, not isolated nor aberrational events.  There is no demonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future.  Actually, 
Applicant's use after he completed the security clearance application, coupled with the diagnosis in 1995 which has not been changed, is very persuasive to me 
that Applicant does have the intent or the will power to stop using marijuana in the future.  Finally, Applicant did not satisfactorily complete the prescribed drug 
program in 1995, and in 2001 reported a relapse and use of marijuana. I do not find his protestations credible and do not find his arguments persuasive on the 
issue of further drug use.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c. of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">With respect to Guideline E, I conclude the Government proved its case as it sets forth in subparagraph 2.a. and 2.b. that Applicant deliberately failed to 
disclose his drug involvement on the personnel security questionnaire submitted in June 2000.  Under Guideline E conduct involving questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not 
properly safeguard classified information.  A security concern may exist when an applicant deliberately omits, conceals, or falsifies relevant and material facts 
from his personnel security questionnaire or deliberately provides false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator in 
connection a personnel security determination.  Through Applicant's admissions, the Government established a prima facie case that Applicant deliberately 
falsified his security clearance application in 2000.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Applicant lied about his use of marijuana in the time period requested in Question 27, which was back to 1993.  He used marijuana in 1994.  But what is more 
troublesome is that Applicant used marijuana after he completed the application in June 2000.  Applicant also lied by failing to answer Question 30 accurately 
and truthfully.  He should have disclosed his alcohol and drug treatment in 1995, but he did not.  His excuse for these two falsifications was that he was in a 
rush to complete the form.  It is not reasonable to expect that someone would forget to include these significant facts in response to the two questions.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 8pt">Therefore, I find Applicant deliberately falsified the answers to Questions 27 and 30 on the security clearance application.  I conclude there is a pattern of 
deception here by Applicant which does not make it clearly consistent with the national interest to issue Applicant a security clearance.  The DC 2 and 5 apply 
here.  Examining and considering the MCs which might apply, I can find none.  Applicant continues to this day to obfuscate and refuse to acknowledge the 
truth, to such a fine degree of even attempting to assert in his Answer that he went voluntarily to the 1995 treatment, but in his July 2001 statement admitting he 
was "sent".  I do not find Applicant credible on these issues and conclude against him.  Accordingly, allegations 2.a. and 2.b. of the SOR are concluded against 
Applicant.</SPAN></P>
