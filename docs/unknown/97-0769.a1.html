  Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Administrative Judge cannot fairly be faulted for not considering events that might occur after close of record evidence.  Despite a harmless factual error, Judge's conclusions about Applicant's history of marijuana use are sustainable.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Administrative Judge Jerome H. Silber issued a decision, dated April 21, 1998, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the reasons set forth below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant's appeal presents the issues of (1) whether the Administrative Judge made incorrect findings; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary,
capricious, or contrary to law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated November 24, 1997 to Applicant.  The SOR was based on Criterion H (Drug Involvement).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR and requested an adjudication of his case without a hearing.  A File of Relevant Material (FORM) was prepared and a copy provided to Applicant.  Applicant
did not submit a response to the FORM.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The case was assigned to Administrative Judge Jerome H. Silber.  The Judge subsequently issued a written decision in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or
continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from the Judge's adverse decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant asserts on appeal that (1) the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant abused the drug Ritalin; (2) the Judge erred by finding Applicant used marijuana "about five times a month;" and
(3) Applicant has been drug-free for one year, is more mature, and is leading a more responsible life.  The Board construes Applicant's first two assertions as contending the Judge made incorrect
findings, and Applicant's last assertion as contending that the Judge's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(1) The Administrative Judge's finding on Applicant's use of Ritalin is based on record evidence (FORM, Item 4).  Applicant challenges the Judge's finding that he abused Ritalin by submitting new
evidence on appeal.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 29.  Applicant was provided a copy of the FORM and had an opportunity to
respond to it, but did not do so.  Having failed to respond to the FORM, Applicant cannot now fairly complain that the Judge erred by making a finding based on information contained in the FORM.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(2) Applicant argues that his marijuana use did not average five times a month, as found by the Administrative Judge.  The record evidence shows Applicant admitted to using marijuana from two to
three times a month (FORM, Item 4) and from one to five times (FORM, Item 5).   Given the totality of the record evidence, there is no apparent basis for the Judge to decide that Applicant's marijuana
use averaged five times a month.  If the Judge had a reason for deciding that Applicant's average marijuana use was at the upper limit of Applicant's admissions, then the Judge should have stated that
reason.  Absent such an explanation, the Judge's finding about Applicant's average marijuana use suggests the Judge made an arbitrary and capricious choice instead of engaging in reasoned fact-finding.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the Administrative Judge's error on this point, there is a sufficient basis in the record evidence for the Judge to conclude that Applicant was more than an experimental user of marijuana
during the period Spring 1994-May 1997, and that Applicant failed to successfully mitigate the government's case against him under Criterion H.  Accordingly, the Judge's factual error was harmless.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(3) Applicant argues that he has been drug-free for one year (with use only once in the last 15 months), he has matured, and that he is now living more responsibly.  Applicant's argument is based on the
inclusion of several months of abstinence since the record closed.  The record in this case closed on February 12, 1998, a date approximately nine months after Applicant's last use of marijuana.  Factual
findings by an Administrative Judge are evaluated in light of the record evidence before the Judge.  A Judge cannot fairly be found to have found to have erred for not considering events that might
occur after the close of the record evidence.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, DISCR Case No. 93-0241 (October 7, 1994) at pp. 3-4.  In addition, Applicant's claim of abstinence after the close of the record constitutes new
evidence, which the Board cannot consider.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge weighed the seriousness of Applicant's marijuana use against all applicable mitigating evidence before reaching his adverse conclusions under Criterion H.  The Board finds
the Judge's conclusions are rationally based on the record evidence, and concludes his adverse decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant has failed to demonstrate error that warrants remand or reversal.  Accordingly, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's April 21, 1998 decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Separate opinion of Administrative Judge Michael Y. Ra'anan</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I disagree with my colleagues on the matter of Applicant's frequency of marijuana use.  As the majority notes, the record contains two admissions by applicant regarding marijuana use.  One admission
estimates the use at two to three times a month, the other estimates it at one to five times a month.  Since it is reasonable to assume, given human nature, that any error or discrepancy in someone's
admissions of misconduct is going to tend to minimize the significance of one's own misconduct, it was not unreasonable for the Judge accept the high end of Applicant's own admissions as being the
most accurate description of the drug use.  It need not have been necessary for the Administrative Judge to explain why he was accepting the most severe admission of misconduct as fact.  It is not
uncommon for the law to move burdens based on an admission (see, e.g., Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 801 (d) (2) and Rule 804 (b) (3)). Therefore, I respectfully dissent from their analysis and
conclusion on this matter.</FONT></P>
