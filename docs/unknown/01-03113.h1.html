<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On February 6, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, as amended, and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which 
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  In a sworn written statement, dated March 10, 2001, the Applicant 
responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR and requested a hearing. </P> 
 
<P>The undersigned Administrative Judge received the case assignment on April 17, 2001, and a notice of hearing was issued on April 27, 
2001.  The undersigned held a hearing on May 31, 2001.  The Department Counsel presented five exhibits ("exhs") but no witnesses.  
The Applicant's case consisted of the presentation of one exhibit and the testimony of two witnesses besides her own testimony.  The 
Applicant submitted a second document ("exh. B"), dated June 5, 2001, which was admitted without objection on June 13, 2001.  The 
record in this case closed on June 13, 2001.  The undersigned Administrative Judge received the transcript ("tr") of the hearing on June 8, 
2001.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SOR AMENDMENT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>SOR &para; 2.a. was amended at the hearing on Department Counsel's motion to conform to the evidence in accordance with item E3.1.17 of 
the additional procedural guidance (encl. 3 to the Directive) by substituting "May 24, 1999" for "April 24, 1999" as the date of the 
Question-naire for National Security Positions (SF-86).  Tr pages 120-122.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on the following two guidelines: paragraph 1, Guideline F (financial 
considerations); and paragraph 2, Guideline E (personal conduct).  The undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly 
reviewed the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, makes the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant is a 56-year-old receptionist and secretary employed for the past four years in the security department of a university 
under contract with the U.S. Government.  The Applicant seeks to upgrade her Secret personnel security clearance to a Top Secret one.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant has been married for 35 years.  The couple has three children, ages 30, 24, and 21.  From 1987 to 1997 she was entrusted 
with safeguarding very high dollar value inventories when she worked for a department store in jewelry sales.  Exh. 1; tr pages 111, 118-119.  Her immediate supervisor, the Top Secret Control Officer for the university, knows the Applicant as "somewhat of a perfectionist," 
a person of "high integrity," and one with "an outstanding record of compliance with security regulations."  Tr pages 82-84, 101-103.</P> 
 
<P><A NAME="QuickMark"></A></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's husband works as a manufacturer's representative and operates under a business name as a sole proprietorship out of 
their homeas is its only employee.  He is compensated solely by com-missions the amount of which (and the timing of their receipt) vary 
to a large extent.  He controls the operation of his business exclusively, and the Applicant herself does not normally have access to its 
books, papers, check registers, <EM>etc</EM>.  All income, expenses, and deductions from his business are reported on the couple's joint income tax 
returns along with her salary.  Typically, her husband's accountant prepares the returns, her husband gives the completed returns to the 
Applicant for her signature, and then her husband signs and mails the tax returns--along with his check on the business' checking 
account if an amount is due.  Tr pages 112-113.</P> 
 
<P>However, the Applicant's husband was strapped for cash when the couple's joint Federal income tax returns were prepared for tax years 
1995-98.  The Applicant's husband took those tax returns, once prepared, to the Applicant and secured her signature on them; he neither 
mailed them to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) nor did he write checks on the business' checking account for the amounts due.  Tr 
pages 41, 54-55, 60.  The Applicant was unaware that the returns she signed were not mailed and no Federal income taxes had been paid 
for those four tax years.  Tr pages 70-71, 123-126, 147-148.  Because her husband was too embarrassed to tell the Applicant, he 
deliberately concealed their tax troubles from her.  SOR response. </P> 
 
<P>During April and May 1999 the Applicant's husband was called by an IRS officer for several interviews (exh. A).  The Applicant herself 
was unaware of these interviews.  Tr pages 113-114.  The IRS officer was satisfied that the couple did not have enough funds with which 
to submit an Offer in Compromise to the IRS and recommended that the case be reported as "currently not collectible."  The officer's 
recommendation was approved by the IRS.  Unless subsequently waived, the tax obligations remain valid--though collection activity is 
suspended temporarily.  A tax lien was filed by the IRS against the couple for tax years 1995 and 1996 on May 7, 1999 (exh. 4).  A tax 
lien was filed by the IRS against the couple for tax year 1997 on July 21, 1999 (exh. 5).  A tax lien was filed by the IRS against the 
couple for tax year 1998. Tr page 43.  The Applicant herself was unaware of these liens until April 2000 when she was confronted by a 
Defense Security Service (DSS) agent with her credit report, dated February 2000 (exh. 3), that revealed these tax liens.</P> 
 
<P>On May 24, 1999, the Applicant signed her Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86) in connection with a possible 
promotion to a document control officer position in the security department.  Being ignorant of the truth, she answered "no" in response 
to a question on the form whether in the last seven years she had had a lien placed against her property for failure to pay taxes or other 
debts.  When she met with the DSS agent in April 2000 and was shown her credit report, she asked her husband whether it was true.  He 
confirmed the credit report.  She later signed a sworn statement (exh. 2) for the DSS agent.<A HREF="01-03113.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  She then went to her supervisor, told her 
supervisor what had happened, and some months later offered to resign.  The offer was refused.  Tr pages 85-87, 93-98.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating 
an individual's security eligibility.  The guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or 
revoke a clearance (Disqualifying Conditions or DC) and those that may be considered in determining whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions or MC).  In evaluating this case, relevant adjudicative guidelines as 
set forth below have been carefully considered as the most pertinent to the facts of this particular case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The guidelines, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating conditions most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case are:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive also requires the undersigned to consider, as appropriate, the factors enumerated in Section 6.3:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 to the Directive provides that the adjudicator should consider the following factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledge-able participation</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security 
clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly consistent</SPAN> with the national interest. In reaching the fair 
and impartial overall common sense determination required, the Administrative Judge may draw only those inferences and conclusions 
that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  Determinations under the Directive include consideration of the risk 
that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information as that term is defined and established 
under Executive Order 12958, effective on October 14, 1995.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme 
Court has said:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence 
standard without departing from the 'clearly consistent with the interests of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government to 
support the denial [of a security clearance] by a preponderance of the evidence would inevitably shift the emphasis and involve the Board 
in second-guessing the agency's national security determinations."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <EM>Dept. of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that Supreme Court guidance in its context 
to go to the minimum <STRONG><EM>quantum</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM> of the admissible evidence that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its 
case, that is, substantial evidence but something less than a preponderance of the evidence--rather than as an indication of the Court's 
tolerance for error below.<SUP><A HREF="01-03113.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his or her security eligibility 
through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case or through evidence of affirmative defenses.  
Assuming the Government's case is not refuted, and further assuming it can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an applicant 
might deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate he or she is nonetheless eligible to hold a security clearance.<SUP><A HREF="01-03113.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility and 
demeanor of those who testified, the undersigned concludes that the Applicant successfully refuted and overcame the Government's case 
with regard to Guidelines F and E.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admitted in her response to SOR &para; 1 that tax liens have been filed against her of approximately $105, 000 by the IRS for 
failure to pay Federal income taxes for tax years 1995-98.  She is presently unable to satisfy these liens wholly.  This falls within the 
scope of DC #3, which is identified on page 4 <EM>supra</EM>.  The record shows that the Applicant signed her income tax returns for those years 
but that her husband did not timely file them.  A failure to file income tax returns when required raises the issue of an intentional breach 
of trust in financial matters, such as income tax evasion (DC #2).  On the other hand, the record is clear that the Applicant did not 
know--and did not have reason to know--that the Federal taxes for those years were neither filed nor paid.  Absent knowing 
accumulation of debt, Guideline F (financial consider-ations) presents no bar to the grant or continuation of a security clearance, 
particularly where an applicant has taken available steps to pay down debt once discovered.  <EM>See </EM>footnote 1 on page 3 <EM>supra</EM>.  With regard 
to Guideline E (personal conduct), the Applicant signed an erroneous SF-86 a few days <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">after</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> the first of the tax liens were filed by the 
IRS.  Note the amendment of the SOR at the hearing.  However, DC #2 under Guideline E, also identified on page 4 supra, is not 
applicable where the omission, concealment, or falsification of a personal security questionnaire is not deliberate.  The record clearly 
supports the finding that the Applicant did not deliberately falsify her SF-86.  Therefore SOR &para; 1 (financial considerations) and SOR &para; 2 
(personal conduct) are concluded favorably to the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each clearance decision is required to take into consideration pertinent factors set forth in Section 6.3 of the Directive and in the 
adjudicative process discussion at enclosure 2 to the Directive.  These factors are identified on page 5 <EM>supra</EM>.  The nature and extent of 
the current liability for back Federal income taxes imposed on the Applicant and her husband are serious.  The age of the Applicant at the 
time the taxes were not filed weighs against her.  Her innocent motivation and her lack of intent, lack of negligence, and lack of 
knowledge weigh heavily in her favor.  Her demonstrated willingness to try to pay down, as best she is able, her current tax liabilities 
also weighs in her favor.  Although the IRS Code imposes joint and several liability on taxpayers who file jointly, decisions on eligibility 
for a security clearance ought to be made on an individual basis alone.</SPAN></P>
