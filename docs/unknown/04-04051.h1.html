<P>Applicant is a 62-year-old linguist who has worked for a federal contractor since 2002. Applicant is a naturalized United States citizen from Iraq. Applicant's 
wife is a citizen of Iraq and resides with him in the United States. Applicant's two sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq. Applicant's parents-in-law are 
citizens and residents of Iraq. Applicant visited his sisters in Iraq in 1994, and in 2000 he traveled there to meet and marry his wife. Applicant failed to provide 
any information to mitigate the security concerns regarding foreign influence. Clearance is denied. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On April 28, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="04-04051.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges a security concern under Guideline B, foreign influence.</P> 
<P>In a sworn statement dated May 11, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, admitting all allegations. Applicant elected to have his case decided on 
the written record. Department Counsel submitted the government's file of relevant material (FORM) on July 13, 2005. The FORM was received by Applicant 
on July 25, 2005. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant provided 
additional material without objection and it was made part of the record. The case was assigned to me on October 7, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements, I 
make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 62-year-old linguist who has worked for a federal contractor since 2002. He has a masters degree from an American university. Applicant is from 
Iraq and became a naturalized  citizen of the United States in 1993. He married an American citizen in 1986, and was divorced from her in 1991. Applicant 
married his present wife in Iraq in 2000. She is a citizen of Iraq and a registered alien in the United States. She resides with Applicant in the United States. They 
have one child born in 2002. From May 2001 to November 2003, Applicant worked for a language specialist company. While assigned to do work for Drug 
Enforcement Agency, Applicant held a national security clearance.<A HREF="04-04051.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant has two sisters who are citizens and residents of Iraq. Applicant's mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of Iraq. Applicant's 
father-in-law works for the Ministry of Public Works in Iraq. Applicant sends a sister in Iraq $100.00 every six months. Applicant traveled to Iraq in 1994 to 
visit his sisters, and again in 2000 to meet and marry his current wife. </P> 
<P>Applicant is considered by people who have worked with him and know him to be a person of integrity and high moral principles. He is considered a good 
friend that can be trusted. Applicant is hard working, reliable and ready to help others. He is considered a loyal citizen. </P> 
<P>No other information was provided by Applicant.</P> 
<P>Iraq currently operates under an Interim Government and conditions there are considered extremely dangerous.<A HREF="04-04051.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Many terrorist and criminal elements remain 
active there.<A HREF="04-04051.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Multi-national forces and civilians continue to be attacked throughout the country.<A HREF="04-04051.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The security environment across Iraq is dangerous, volatile 
and unpredictable.<A HREF="04-04051.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> There are killings as well as extortions and kidnappings of Americans and other foreigners.<A HREF="04-04051.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Americans are strongly warned against 
traveling in Iraq.<A HREF="04-04051.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Considering the evidence as a whole 
Guideline B, foreign influence, with its respective DC and MC, applies in this case. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial 
commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. 
Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of 
the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the 
consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. 
Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be 
followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="04-04051.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-04051.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="04-04051.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against</P> 
<P>him.<A HREF="04-04051.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-04051.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="04-04051.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="04-04051.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="04-04051.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="04-04051.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
<P>Guideline B-Foreign Influence is a concern because a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons 
to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligations are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial 
interest in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guidelines are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guideline B.</P> 
<P>Based on all the evidence, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1 (<EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual 
has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country)</EM>, FI DC E2.A2.1.2.2 (<EM>Sharing living quarters with a person 
or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists), </EM>and FI DC E2.A2.1.2.3 (<EM>Relatives, cohabitants, 
or associates who are connected with any foreign government</EM>) all apply. Applicant's two sisters are immediate family members who are citizens and residents 
of Iraq. Applicant semi-annually sends one sister money. Applicant's in-laws are also citizens and residents of Iraq and he has ties of affection to them through 
his wife. Applicant's father-in-law works for the Iraqi government. Applicant's wife, who lives in the United States with him is an Iraqi citizen. There is 
potential for foreign influence due to Applicant's family ties.</P> 
<P>No information was provided by Applicant to mitigate the security concerns regarding his sisters and in-laws who are all citizens of Iraq and reside there. 
Applicant failed to provide any information that may mitigate the security concerns regarding his wife's citizenship; any information about any contact he or his 
wife may have with his relatives and her parents; if there is any contact, whether it is casual and infrequent; any information that may mitigate Applicant's 
father-in-law's contact with the Iraqi government; what, if any, connection his other relatives in Iraq may have with the government; and any other relevant 
facts that may mitigate the security concerns raised by his family ties. Without specific and detailed information I find no mitigating conditions apply. 
Therefore, I also find Applicant has failed to meet his burden and mitigate the security concern regarding foreign influence.</P> 
<P>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
<P>I have considered the whole person and I find Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in 
this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Accordingly, Guideline B is decided against 
Applicant.</P>
