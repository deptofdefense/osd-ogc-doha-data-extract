<P>Applicant has a history of excessive indebtedness, including a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1995. His petitions for Chapter 13 in 1996, and again in 1998, were both 
dismissed for failing to make the trustee payments.  Neither his financial problems nor his intentional falsifications on two separate security clearance 
applications concerning his arrest and financial history have not been mitigated.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On February 14, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P>The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on February 28, 2002, in which he elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.   
Department Counsel submitted  the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on May 15, 2002.  The Applicant was instructed to 
submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on July 22, 2002, and he submitted no reply.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on September 23, 2002. </P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 55 years old.  He is employed as a Pipe Fitter by a defense contractor and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his 
employment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  
The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</SPAN>  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially 
overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Applicant met his wife while working in another country.  They were married in June 1994 and moved to the United States to live in September 1994.  His 
wife, who came from a wealthy family, was accustomed to buying the things she wanted regardless of their cost.  It was also during this time that the Applicant 
began experiencing a downturn in the construction market, and was not earning enough money to pay the bills.  In January 1995, he was forced to file Chapter 7 
bankruptcy.  (<EM>See,</EM> Item 8).</P> 
<P>The Applicant continued to have difficulty finding steady employment.  It was not long before he once again fell behind on his bills.  To make things worse, the 
Applicant's sister came to live with them, and the Applicant had the extra burden of financially supporting her too.  Again, he was unable to pay the bills and in 
August 1996, he filed for bankruptcy again.  This time he filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.  The arrangement with the bankruptcy trustee required the 
Applicant to pay $306.00 a month for five years to satisfy his creditors. The Applicant "totaled" a vehicle, which was the bulk of the debt, and did not see the 
point in continuing to pay the bankruptcy trustee under the plan.   In February 1997, the Applicant decided that he no longer wanted the trustee to pay off his 
debts, that he could pay them off himself, so he stopped making payments to the trustee.  His Chapter 13 petition for bankruptcy was dismissed on July 3 1997.  
(<EM>See</EM>, Item 9).</P> 
<P>In June 1998, the Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy again.  He again failed to make timely payments to the bankruptcy trustee and the petition was 
dismissed on August 28, 1998.  (<EM>See</EM>, Item 10).  </P> 
<P>The following 30 debts were originally set forth in the Applicant's Chapter 13 petition that was dismissed by the court because the Applicant failed to make the 
required payments under the plan.  These debts have not been discharged by the court nor paid by the Applicant.  (<EM>See</EM>, Items 15 and 17).  They are still owing.  
He states that his attorney told him that he does not have to pay any of the unsecured debts listed in his Chapter 13.  After contacting some of his creditors, he 
also learned that many of his debts have been written off by the creditors.  At any rate, the Applicant indicates that he has no intention of paying any of the 
debts, and does not believe that he is legally obligated to do so.  </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility and dishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant was financially irresponsible (Guideline F); that he intentionally falsified 
material facts on two separate security clearance applications (Guideline E), and that by doing so he violated 18 United Stated Code Section 1001 (Guideline J).  
This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's 
conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P>With respect to his finances, over the past eight years, the Applicant has experienced some sick leave without pay, a lay-off and extended periods of difficulty 
finding steady employment.  For most of 1998, he was unemployed, and had to live off of his savings and unemployment benefits. Unfortunately,  he has 
continued to incur debt, some of which could have been avoidable.  In 1995, the Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and discharged his indebtedness.  He 
was at that time, debt free.  Just one year later, in 1996, he was again in serious financial trouble and forced to file for bankruptcy.  Unable to make the required 
payments to the trustee under the Chapter 13 plan, the petition was dismissed.  Two years later, he filed for Chapter 13 again and the petition was again 
dismissed for failing to timely pay the bankruptcy trustee.  Since then, the Applicant has been unable to pay his debts, and remains in a position where he poses 
a potentially serious risk to the national security.  Although he indicates that a few of the debts have been paid, he provides no documentary evidence to support 
this.  All of the debts that were listed in the SOR are still outstanding.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  </P> 
<P>It is unclear from the record why the Applicant did not reveal his complete arrest and financial history in response to questions on two of his security clearance 
applications.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With the particular evidence that I have been provided, there is no excuse for this.  I have been provided no reasonable excuse for the Applicant to 
have failed to reveal this information.  Consequently, the evidence proves that the Applicant has not been completely honest with the Government regarding his 
arrest and financial history.  I find that the Applicant deliberately failed to reveal this information to the Government.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders.  It is a negative factor for security clearance purposes when an Applicant 
has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of his personal background.  This Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and 
does not meet the eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) 
and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).   </SPAN></P> 
<P>The Applicant has not provided this Administrative Judge with sufficient evidence in mitigation that would negate the negative impact his falsifications have on 
his security worthiness.  At this time, I cannot find that it is clearly consistent with the national interests to grant the Applicant a security clearance.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Government's 
Statement of Reasons.   </SPAN></P>
