<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 3, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the sub-allegations set forth in the SOR are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings 
of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 33 years old and works for a federal defense contractor. He has been employed by his current employer </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">since September 1999. During the course of this employment, Applicant has worked 
as a janitor and as an escort. He is single and has no children. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Starting around 1987, when he was approximately 15 years of age, Applicant began smoking marijuana. He purchased the drug for consumption and smoked it on at least a weekly basis. He often 
"smoked up to the equivalent of five joints, sometimes by [himself] and sometimes with a group."<A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> His drug usage was social and he did not use drugs at work. Additionally, for two to three months in 
the early 1990s, he also sold both marijuana and crack cocaine.<A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> In August 1997, he was diagnosed with a psychiatric condition and was treated through counseling and medication. As part of his 
treatment, he temporarily quit or reduced his use of marijuana. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A few months later, in October 1997, Applicant stopped taking his medication. This cessation led to a relapse eventually requiring in-patient treatment. During his relapse, he smoked marijuana on a few 
occasions. Following his relapse and treatment, he used marijuana occasionally through some time in 2003, when he quit using the drug. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On July 15, 2003, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SF-86). In response to "</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Question 27. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Illegal  Use of Drugs</STRONG> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Since the age of 
16 or in the last 7 years, which ever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, 
etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescriptions drugs?</EM>," he answered "no." Subsequently, in a sworn statement 
dated November 9, 2004, he admitted he had smoked marijuana since about the age of 15, but that he quit in October 1997. In a later sworn statement, dated May 16, 2005, Applicant stated that he had 
ceased smoking marijuana in early 1998. When responding to the SOR in November 2005, Applicant admitted that he had continued to smoke marijuana through 2003 and that he had concealed this 
fact "because [he] did not want to jeopardize [his] career since [he] felt it harmless . . . because it did not affect [his] performance or attendance at work."<A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions 
(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and 
material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding 
circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or 
undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this 
policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.<A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN> The government has the 
burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present 
evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against</P> 
 
<P>him.<A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN> Any reasonable doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information.<A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN> The decision to deny an individual a security 
clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following two adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline H - Drug Involvement</SPAN>. <EM>The Concern</EM>: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. 
Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">That guideline continues with the following definitions:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Drugs are defined as mood and behavior-altering substances, and include:</STRONG><A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG> Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, 
as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens); and</STRONG><A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>[i]nhalants and other similar substances.</STRONG><A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG> Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Moreover, consideration must be given to 10 U.S.C. 986. Under that statute, any person who is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance, as defined in section 102 of the Controlled 
Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802), is disqualified from being granted a security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct</SPAN>. </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules 
and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Conditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in 
the conclusions below.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all legal precepts, factors, and conditions, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>Drug Involvement</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline H (Drug Involvement), the Government has established its case. Applicant admits that he has purchased marijuana, and that he illegally used marijuana from the time he was a 
teenager until sometime in 2003. He also concedes that he sold both marijuana and crack cocaine in the 1990s. Such facts raise security concerns with regard to Drug Involvement Disqualifying 
Conditions (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1 ([<EM>a</EM>]<EM>ny drug abuse</EM>)<A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and DI DC E2.A8.1.2.2 ([</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>i</EM>]</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>llegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution</EM>). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">When the Government's initial burden has been met and disqualifying conditions raised, the burden shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation, or mitigation which is 
sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case. Here, the facts indicate that Applicant has not used marijuana since 2003, therefore Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) 
E2.A8.1.3.1 ([</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>t</EM>]</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>he drug involvement was not recent</EM>) may apply. Prior to that, however, Applicant was a regular abuser of marijuana for approximately 15 years. Consequently, DI MC E2.A8.1.3.2 ([</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>t</EM>]</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>he 
drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event</EM>) does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant did not supplement the record with many facts about himself, therefore, the record includes little information which might tend to mitigate security concerns. Specifically, he did not submit 
any facts or information regarding his future intentions regarding drug usage or explain whether he received any counseling or treatment for his drug use. Therefore, neither </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">DI MC E2.A8.1.3.3 ([</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a</EM>]</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> 
demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future</EM>) nor DI MC E2.A8.1.3.4 ([</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>s</EM>]</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>atisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including rehabilitation and aftercare 
requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional</EM>)<A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> applies.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based on Applicant's own submissions, he admits all the allegations regarding drug involvement. The only mitigating fact raised is that he has refrained from marijuana usage for approximately three 
years. Three years of abstinence alone, in light of all the facts presented, is not sufficient to mitigate security concerns.<A HREF="04-09912.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><EM>Personal Conduct</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified material facts regarding his drug use  on his SF-86 and two subsequent sworn statements. Specifically, the government points to Applicant's failure 
to disclose prior drug use on his 2003 SF-86, and his subsequent concealment in two sworn statements that his drug use had continued into 2003. Applicant admits these allegations are true. 
Consequently, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition E2.A5.1.2.2 ([</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>t</EM>]</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>he deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or 
award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>) applies.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant conceded that he actively concealed the fact that his marijuana usage continued beyond 1997 and 1998 until 2003 because he thought his occasional use was harmless and because he thought 
that an honest disclosure would jeopardize his career. The concealment of such a fact demonstrates bad judgment and a lack of candor. It also raises genuine questions regarding his trustworthiness and 
reliability. Under these facts, none of the Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions apply, and security concerns raised by Applicant's concealment remain.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have considered both the record evidence and Applicant in light of the "whole person" concept. Applicant is a mature young man who has honestly admitted that he used marijuana in the past, and that 
he concealed the recency of his cessation of that drug because he feared it would jeopardize his career. Perhaps with more facts or explanation, Applicant could mitigate the security concerns raised. 
Based on his submissions, however, those concerns remain. In these matters, the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Consequently, Guideline H and Guideline E are decided against Applicant. </SPAN></P>
