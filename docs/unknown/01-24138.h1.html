<P>Thirty-two-year-old Applicant from a dysfunctional family engaged in several criminal acts when he was between 16 and 19 years old.  He was sentenced to 
imprisonment for 10 years for burglary and 5 years for malicious shooting.  Since his release from prison, Applicant has been a model citizen, working several 
jobs, completing his associate's and bachelor's degrees, and working on a master's degree.  Applicant fully mitigated the criminal conduct security concerns.  
However, absent a waiver from the Secretary of Defense, Applicant is barred from receiving a clearance.  10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  Clearance is denied.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I recommend

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 19 March 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) under the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="01-24138.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive<A HREF="01-24138.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-failure to meet 
the criminal conduct (Guideline J) personnel security guideline of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 1 April 2003 and elected to have a 
hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 14 July 2003.  On 19 August 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 26 
August 2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 32 years old.  Ex. 1 at 1; Ex. 3 at 1. Applicant was raised in a dysfunctional home.  Ex. 4 at 18; Ex. 2 at 1.  By the time he was 17, he had stopped 
attending school, did not obey his mother, used marijuana, and engaged in underage drinking.  Ex. 3 at 2.  His mother eventually kicked him out of the house 
and he was living from place to place.  Tr. 43-44.</P> 
 
<P>In December 1989, when he was 18, Applicant were riding around town in a car when Applicant's friend (W) stopped at his residence and picked up a shotgun.  
They drove to the residence of an individual W did not like.  Applicant attempted to stop W from taking the shotgun out of the car, but W prevailed.  W got out 
of the car, walked up to the house and fired the shotgun into the house.  Later that evening, W fired into the house of a judge and into a market.  Applicant was 
arrested and charged with malicious shooting, destroying private property, and destroying, defacing, or injuring property.  Ex. 3 at 2.  He was released on bond 
on 7 February 1990.  Ex. 4 at 14.</P> 
 
<P>On 14 February 1990, while out on bond and awaiting trial, Applicant was arrested for driving on a suspended operator's license, failing to stop at the scene of 
an accident, destroying private property, and reckless driving.  On 12 March 1990, the Grand Jury issued indictments on these charges.  Ex. 5 at 1-4.</P> 
 
<P>On 26 April 1990, Applicant pled guilty to malicious shooting, destroying private property, and destroying, defacing or injuring property.  His sentencing was 
scheduled then rescheduled for July 1990.  Ex. 4 at 12-13.</P> 
 
<P>On 31 May 1990, Applicant was arrested and charged with statutory rape.  Ex. 4 at 14; Answer.  The charge was Nolle Prossed when the alleged victim failed 
to appear on two different trial dates.  Ex. 3 at 3; Tr. 44-45.  </P> 
 
<P>On 9 July 1990, Applicant pled guilty to reckless driving and leaving the scene of an accident.  He was sentenced to six months in jail suspended for two years.  
Ex. 5 at .  The remaining offenses were Nolle Prossed.  Ex. 5 at 9, 10.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant was sentenced for the malicious shooting to five years in jail, with two years suspended.  He was sentenced to 12 months in prison (suspended) on 
each of the other charges.  He was imprisoned from August 1990 to June 1991.  Ex. 3 at 2-3.  </P> 
 
<P>On 5 July 1991, Applicant drove the "getaway car" for W, who broken into a sporting goods store and stole pistols and rifles.  On 12 November 1991, the 
Grand Jury returned indictments against Applicant for burglary and grand theft.  Ex. 6 at 4-5.  As a result of a plea agreement, Applicant pled guilty to burglary 
and the grand larceny indictment was Nolle Prossed.  Ex. 6 at 6-9.  Applicant was eventually sentenced to 10 years in prison with five years suspended.  Ex. 3 at 
3.  </P> 
 
<P>On 13 January 1992, the court revoked the suspension of the execution of the sentence to imprisonment for two years from the shooting incident.  Ex. 4 at 20.  
Applicant was released from prison on 24 October 1995.  </P> 
 
<P>When Applicant was released from prison, it is clear he was a different person.  He sought employment and went back to school.  He received degrees from a 
junior college and from a four-year college, the latter with high honors.  Exs. C, G.  Applicant has been employed ever since leaving prison.  During his 
schooling, he sometimes worked two jobs.  He has worked for a defense contractor for the past three years, during which time he was "exposed to classified 
information" for two years until the SOR was issued.  Tr. 8, 37.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is engaged to be married and has bought a home.  For the past year, Applicant and his fianc&eacute;e have had custody of his fianc&eacute;e's cousin who comes 
from a dysfunctional home and has had considerable troubles at school.  This individual has made substantial progress in developing as a student since moving 
in with Applicant and his fianc&eacute;e.  Tr. 35-36.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.  Doubts are resolved against the 
applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was arrested in 1989 and convicted in 1990 of shooting into an occupied dwelling and sentenced to five years in prison (&para; 
1.a.), arrested and convicted in 1990 of reckless driving and leaving the scene of an accident (&para; 1.b.), arrested and charged with statutory rape in 1990 (&para; 1.c.), 
and arrested and convicted in 1991 of burglary and sentenced to 10 years in prison (&para; 1.d.).  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, absent a waiver from the Secretary of Defense, the Department of 
Defense (DOD) may not grant or renew a security clearance for an applicant who has been convicted in a state or federal court and sentenced to imprisonment 
for a term exceeding one year.  10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence each of the allegations contained in the SOR.  Applicant engaged in several serious criminal offenses.  DC 
1.  Although Applicant was arrested and charged with statutory rape when he was 19 (&para; 1.1.c.), there is no evidence whatsoever to believe that he committed the 
offense.  He has admitted all of the other criminal conduct, but vehemently denies having sexual contact with the complainant in the statutory rape offense.  The 
complainant failed to appear on two different trial dates.  Finding is for Applicant on &para; 1.c.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant established that his criminal behavior, while extensive, was not recent.  MC 1.  Applicant's last conviction occurred when he was 19 years old.  
Furthermore, there is clear evidence of his successful rehabilitation.  He has been a model citizen since 1995 when he was released from prison.  There is no 
potential for exploitation because of these convictions.  While Applicant is not proud of his criminal past, he has not tried to keep it a secret.  After considering 
all the evidence of record the likelihood of recurrence is extremely remote.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E2.2.1, Adjudicative Process factors.  Applicant has sufficiently 
mitigated the criminal conduct personnel security concerns on each of the four allegations contained in the SOR.  Even the Department Counsel conceded as 
much.  Tr. 51-52.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, as a result of his sentence to imprisonment for 10 years for burglary (&para; 1.d.) and five years for malicious shooting (&para; 1.a.), Applicant is ineligible for a 
security clearance absent a waiver from the Secretary of Defense.  10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(d).  Finding must be against Applicant on &para;&para; 1.a. and 1.d.  As 10 U.S.C. &sect; 
986 is the sole reason Applicant is being denied a security clearance, a recommendation for waiver of the clearance bar is appropriate.  <EM>See</EM> DOHA Operating 
Instruction 64, <EM>Processing Procedures for Cases Subject to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986</EM> &para; 3.e. (Jul. 10, 2001).  I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver 
of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</SPAN></P>
