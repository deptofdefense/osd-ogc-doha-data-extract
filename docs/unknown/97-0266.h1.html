</P>

<P>	On April 14, 1997<A NAME="SOR's date"></A>, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January
2, 1992 (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and recommended
referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,
denied, or revoked.  In an undated and unsworn written statement, the Applicant responded to the
allegations set forth in the SOR and elected to have his case decided on a written record, in lieu of
a hearing.  A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and incorporated herein by reference.</P>

<P>	The Applicant received a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) on June 26,
1997<A NAME="date FORM received"></A>.  The Applicant also received an opportunity then to file objections and submit material in
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  The Applicant elected not to respond to the FORM within the
requisite 30 days, <EM><STRONG>i.e.</STRONG></EM>, on or before July 26, 1997.  The record in this case closed on July 26, 1997. 
The undersigned Administrative Judge received the case assignment on July 29, 1997.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on a single criterion:
paragraph 1, Criterion G (alcohol consumption).  The Applicant has admitted the factual allegations
contained in subparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d. of the SOR.<A HREF="97-0266.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> </P>

<P>	The undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly reviewed the evidence in
the record, and upon due consideration of the same, makes the following Findings of Fact:</P>

<P>	The Applicant is a 44-year-old pipe welder employed by a U.S. Government contractor for
the last ten years.  The Applicant seeks to obtain a personnel security clearance.</P>

<P>	The Applicant started consuming beer when he was 13 or 14 years old.  He generally did not
abuse alcohol and drank on average a six-pack of beer a week and no hard liquor.  He did not
become intoxicated to the point of passing out or not being able to physically function.<A HREF="97-0266.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  This pattern
changed in about 1993 when he was 40 years old and encountered serious marital problems.  From
about 1993 the Applicant began drinking 4-12 beers 2-3 times a week.</P>

<P>	The Applicant has been arrested twice for Driving Under the Influence (DUI): once on July
22, 1994 (0.20% BAC) and again on July 23, 1996 (0.18+% BAC).  FORM item 4, page 3.  He was
alcohol abstinent for 4-5 months after his first DUI and reduced his drinking somewhat for a few
months after his second DUI.  FORM item 4, pages 1-2, <EM>but see</EM> item 5, page 1.  After his first DUI,
the Applicant was required to undergo an assessment on September 13, 1994, and a "24-hour
intensive intervention" school on September 27, 1994.  FORM item 9.  In about November 1994 he
attended an alcohol and/or drug rehabilitation outpatient program 2-4 hours per night twice a week
for eight weeks.  FORM item 4, page 3.  On March 10, 1995, he also completed an alcohol/drug
program of an uncertain type and duration.  FORM item 10.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative
guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  The guidelines
are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or revoke a clearance
(Disqualifying Conditions or DC) and those that may be considered in determining whether to grant
or continue an individual's access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions or MC).  In
evaluating this case, relevant adjudicative guidelines as set forth below have been carefully con-sidered as the most pertinent to the facts of this particular case.</P>

<P>	The criteria, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating conditions most pertinent to an
evaluation of the facts of this case are:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>CRITERION G - ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>		Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of
questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses,
and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified
information due to carelessness.</STRONG></P>

<P>		<STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be
disqualifying include:</STRONG>  </P>

<P>			  (1)	alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as
driving while under the influence, fighting, child or
spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to
alcohol use; </P>

<P>			  (4)	habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point
of impaired judgment; </P>

<P>		<STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P>

<P>				None applicable.</P>

<P>	The Directive also requires the undersigned to consider, as appropriate, the factors
enumerated in Section F.3:</P>

<P>		a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</P>

<P>		b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P>

<P>		c. Age of the applicant.</P>

<P>		d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct
was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of
the consequences involved.</P>

<P>		e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P>

<P>		f. Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur
in the future.</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 to the Directive provides that the adjudicator should consider the following
factors:</P>

<P>		The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</P>

<P>		The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include
knowledgeable participation</P>

<P>		The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<P>		The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<P>		The voluntariness of participation</P>

<P>		The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent
behavioral changes</P>

<P>		The motivation for the conduct</P>

<P>		The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</P>

<P>		The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</P>

<P>	Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision
to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding
that to do so is <U>clearly consistent</U> with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall
common sense determination required, the Administrative Judge may only draw those inferences
and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  Determinations
under the Directive include consideration of the risk that an applicant may deliberately or
inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information as that term is defined and established
under Executive Order 12958, effective on October 14, 1995.</P>

<P>	Initially, the Government has the burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme Court has said:</P>

<P>		It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence
standard without departing from the 'clearly consistent with the
interests of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard
indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they
must, on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government
to support the denial [of a security clearance] by a preponderance of
the evidence would inevitably shift the emphasis and involve the
Board in second-guessing the agency's national security
determinations.</P>

<P> <EM>Dept. of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that
Supreme Court guidance in its context to go to the minimum <STRONG><EM>quantum</EM></STRONG> of the admissible evidence
that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its case, that is, substantial
evidence but something less than a preponderance of the evidence -- rather than as an indication of
the Court's tolerance for error below.<A HREF="97-0266.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the applicant for the purpose
of establishing his or her security eligibility through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation
of the Government's case or through evidence of affirmative defenses.  Assuming the Government's
case is not refuted, and further assuming it can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an
applicant might deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information, the
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he or she is nonetheless eligible to hold
a security clearance.<A HREF="97-0266.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, the undersigned concludes that the Government established its case with regard to Criterion
G.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Applicant has had three alcohol-related incidents within the last seven years and has a
history of habitual and excessive alcohol consumption within at least the last four years.  This
conduct falls within the scope of DC #1 and DC #4, identified on page 3 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  Although he has
been exposed to several alcohol education and rehabilitation programs in 1994-95, he continues to
drink alcohol and, indeed, had an arrest for DUI only a year before the close of the record.  He has
not significantly reduced the rate of his alcohol consumption, has not attended meetings of
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or a similar organization, and has not made positive changes in
behavior supportive of sobriety.  In absence of evidence of extenuation or mitigation, the
undersigned Administrative Judge concludes SOR paragraph 1 adversely to the Applicant </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Each case decision is required to consider, as appropriate, the factors listed in Section F.3 and
enclosure 2 to the Directive.  Those factors are identified on pages 3-4 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  The Applicant has a
serious and continuing alcohol problem that he denies.  He stated in a sworn statement to a Defense
Investigative Service (DIS) agent on October 16, 1996, that, while he does not feel he has an alcohol
problem and he has never really felt that he needed to cut down on his drinking, he "intends on
stopping totally after his court date" for his second DUI.  FORM item 4, page 2.  The absence of
current rehabilitation as well as the occurrence of a second DUI after he received counseling--and,
indeed, education in the course of alcoholism--suggest recurring and deepening health problems yet
await the Applicant.<A NAME="F.3 Directive analysis"></A></FONT></P>
