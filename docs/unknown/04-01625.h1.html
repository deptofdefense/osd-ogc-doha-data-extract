<P>Applicant was cited for three security violations, one in 1996, and two in 2000. When balanced against the actions he has taken in response to those violations 
and his lengthy military and civilian careers during which he held a clearance without other incidents, the security concerns about his violations and personal 
conduct are mitigated. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make 
a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="04-01625.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On March 14, 2005, DOHA issued to 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline K (security violations) and 
Guideline E (personal conduct). Applicant timely answered the SOR, and requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on September 9, 2005, and I convened a hearing October 20, 2005. The parties appeared as scheduled and the government 
presented six exhibits (GE 1 through 6), which were admitted without objection. Applicant and two other witnesses testified, and Applicant submitted one 
document admitted without objection as Applicant's Exhibit (AE) A. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on November 1, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 64 years old and has held his current job with a defense contractor since November 2001. Before this he worked for another defense contractor 
from September 1990 until October 2001. Applicant served in the United States Navy from 1962, when he matriculated at the U.S. Naval Academy, until 1990, 
when he retired as a commander (paygrade O-5) after 26 years of  honorable service as a commissioned officer in the surface warfare community. Applicant 
developed expertise in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) while in the Navy, and his assignments later in his career used that expertise on unified command staffs 
where he also worked with NATO counterparts. Applicant was first granted a security clearance while still at the Naval Academy in 1962, and he has held a 
clearance at various levels, including TS/SCI, ever since. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After retiring, Applicant went to work for a company that supported the planning and execution of Navy ASW exercises, often in overseas locations and in 
conjunction with allied naval forces. Applicant and his fellow employees worked in the same office space as their Navy customers. The spaces used were 
configured as open cubicle workstations for each person and were in a secure location intended to store and receive classified information as required. 
Telephone conversations involving classified information were to be carried out using a Secure Telephone Unit (STU-III). The STU-III is a telephone that can 
be used like any regular telephone for unclassified discussions. It also has been modified for encryption of voice conversations using keys turned at each end of 
the line when the parties determine they will be discussing classified information. While working for this employer, there were not enough STU-IIIs available 
for unplanned use. They were either broken or were reserved for use by the uniformed Navy members on staff.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 16, 1996, Applicant was involved in the planning of an ASW exercise to be held overseas. He received a phone call initiated by a Naval officer 
who was Applicant's counterpart in the overseas exercise area several time zones ahead of Applicant's east coast location in the U.S. During their conversation, 
the counterpart unexpectedly began discussing topics that Applicant was concerned were classified. Because of the time difference between the two sites, 
Applicant's counterpart wanted to complete their business before the end of his duty day. Applicant was not on a STU-III and none was immediately available. 
Applicant tried to talk around the information to avoid disclosing classified information but knew at the end of the conversation he had been unsuccessful. 
When he hung up, Applicant loudly expressed his frustration aloud at having to discuss classified information over a non-secure line because the Navy could 
not more readily provide a STU-III. Applicant's statement was heard by a member of the Navy inspection team evaluating the security posture of the 
organization Applicant's company was supporting. As a result of what was determined to be a security violation, Applicant was suspended without pay for two 
days.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The relationship between the company Applicant worked for and the Navy staff they supported was not ideal. There was tension between the civilian and 
military staffs, and Applicant's employer was concerned that the Navy was not happy with the support they were receiving and may look elsewhere for 
contractor support. When the aforementioned telephone conversation took place, the Navy command was also undergoing a periodic security readiness 
inspection. Discrepancies from whatever source - civilian or military - would reflect adversely on the officer-in-charge of that activity.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On Sunday, March 19, 2000, Applicant traveled overseas to a Naval command to conduct one of the aforementioned ASW exercises. He flew to a major city 
north of the command, arriving the morning of Monday, March 20, and rented a car to drive the remaining two hours to his destination. He had in his 
possession properly wrapped confidential exercise materials consisting of working papers and charts at the confidential level. Applicant was authorized to carry 
them from the U.S. Along the way he stopped for gas. When he went inside to pay, his car containing all his possessions and the exercise materials was stolen. 
He estimates he was less than 20 feet away from his car for no more than two minutes. He immediately notified all appropriate Navy officials, including the 
Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), his employer, and local law enforcement personnel about what happened. He also took every available corrective 
action to ensure the exercise was not delayed or compromised in any way.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the course of the investigation into the loss of classified materials when Applicant's car was stolen, it was determined he had possessed the materials at 
his home from the time he left work Friday, March 17, until he departed on travel Sunday, March 19. Applicant was an authorized courier of the materials in 
question, but it was determined he committed a security violation by keeping them at his home, which was not an authorized storage facility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No adverse action was taken against Applicant as a result of the March 2000 events, but his company duly reported them to the Defense Security Service (DSS) 
as required by the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M, January 1995. Neither DSS nor the Navy determined 
that Applicant's actions resulted in actual compromise of the information at issue. The information lost when the car was stolen was double wrapped and sealed 
as it had been when he left work the previous Friday and as required by Navy procedures at the time.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since moving to his current job in 2001, Applicant does not travel as extensively as before and he does not carry classified material as part of his current duties. 
He supports a joint command and sometimes interacts with foreign military liaisons, but he is no longer an exercise planner per se. Applicant's violations 
discussed above are the only such incidents in an otherwise unblemished 43-year record of service in the military and civilian defense communities. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two co-workers testified in support of Applicant. One was a retired Navy officer with more than 22 years enlisted and commissioned service, who also worked 
with Applicant in 1996 and 2000 when Applicant was cited for the aforementioned security violations. Notwithstanding those events, he recommended 
Applicant keep his clearance and spoke enthusiastically about Applicant's judgment, reliability, and dedication to the work his company does for the U.S. 
military. This witness also testified that Applicant is committed to following required security procedures and is keenly aware of the importance of sound 
practices in protecting classified information. Applicant's other witness retired from the military in 2000 as a Navy Force Master Chief, the highest enlisted 
rank in the service. He then went to work for a defense contractor also doing business at the same site as Applicant's employer. He has been Applicant's team 
leader since 2002, and, based on 26 years  experience as a Navy cryptologist and his close observation of Applicant's work and his overall conduct, commended 
Applicant for his expertise, reliability, and judgment. He, too, spoke highly of Applicant's commitment to the need to properly safeguard classified material.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="04-01625.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> for an applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the 
government meets its burden, it establishes that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for an applicant to have access to classified information. 
The applicant must then present sufficient evidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, 
applicants bear a heavy burden of persuasion to comply with the government's compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, 
reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own.<A HREF="04-01625.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard 
compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="04-01625.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="04-01625.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> for consideration when evaluating an applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Security 
clearance decisions must reflect consideration of disqualifying and mitigating conditions listed under each adjudicative guideline as may be applicable to the 
facts and circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the 
Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific 
applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of 
access to classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are 
Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline K (security violations).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government alleged Applicant committed three security violations, one in 1996 involving discussion of classified information over a non-secure line (SOR 
&para; 1.a), one in March 2000 when Applicant improperly kept classified materials in his home en route to an overseas exercise (SOR  &para; 1.b), and one in March 
2000 involving loss of classified materials when Applicant's car was stolen overseas (SOR &para; 1.c). As addressed through Guideline K, a security concern exists 
when it is shown a person </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">does not comply with security regulations. Such conduct raises doubt about an individual's trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to 
safeguard classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Included in the SOR allegations are cites to specific sections of the NISPOM, which provides guidance, regulations, and requirements for proper handling of 
classified information in an industrial security context. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Specifically, SOR</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> &para; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a alleges Applicant's actions violated NISPOM 5-100, 5-101, and 5-404. SOR</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> &para; 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b alleges violations of NISPOM 5-100 and 5-304. SOR</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> &para; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c alleges violations of NISPOM 5-100 and 5-410.c. NISPOM 5-100 is a general requirement that 
defense contractors are responsible for any classified information in their charge. NISPOM 5-101 prohibits discussion of classified information over unsecured 
telephones. NISPOM 5-304 requires materials classified  as confidential to be stored the same as secret and to secret materials. NISPOM 5-404 requires that 
"transmission" of any confidential material outside a secure facility shall be done in the same way as secret material, but also allows confidential material may 
be sent by U.S. Postal Certified Mail. NISPOM 5-410.c provides that if a cleared contractor hand carries confidential materials outside a secure facility, he shall 
retain possession of that material at all times. Further, the contractor shall make arrangements in advance at an approved facility for any overnight storage that 
may be necessary. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel has presented sufficient information to support the facts alleged in SOR </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&para;</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 1. Those facts also constitute violations of the NISPOM 
provisions listed above. Available information supports the preliminary decision under Guideline K to deny Applicant's request to renew his clearance. 
Specifically, this record supports application of Guideline K disqualifying condition (DC) 1<A HREF="04-01625.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 2.<A HREF="04-01625.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> As to DC 1, Applicant discussed classified information 
over a non-secure telephone in October 1996. DC 2 applies to the October 1996 violation, in that Applicant was negligent by not insisting the other party to the 
phone call stop talking and make arrangements to continue the conversation on s secure phone. DC 2 applies also to the March 2000 violation wherein he took 
classified materials home the day before he flew overseas. This he knew at the time was not authorized, but was done as a matter of convenience. As to the 
arch 2000 violation resulting from the theft of his rental car overseas, some negligence may be assigned to Applicant in that he left the car unattended for a 
minute or two. However, it has not been shown the theft was a reasonably foreseeable event. Nonetheless, classified material was theoretically disclosed 
without authorization and both DC 1 and DC 2 must be considered here as well.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, Guideline K mitigating condition (MC) 1,<A HREF="04-01625.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> MC 2,<A HREF="04-01625.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and MC 4<A HREF="04-01625.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> also apply to these facts. In considering application of MC 1, I conclude the October 
1996 telephone discussion and the loss of the materials in March 2000 when his car was stolen were both inadvertent. As to the former, the call was originated 
by the other party, who was anxious to complete his business and who, without warning to Applicant, injected classified information into the conversation. 
Applicant was placed in the untenable position of having to stop the conversation to arrange for use of a STU III that he knew was unavailable anyway. 
Regarding the stolen car incident, it can be argued he should have been more attentive, however, such an event is unexpected, to say the least. This is not a case 
of Applicant leaving the materials wholly unguarded and out of sight while he attended to personal business. He was less than 20 feet away from the car for less 
than two minutes. He was otherwise in control of the materials at all times. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to MC 2, these three events constitute the only errors of this kind in Applicant's Navy and civilian careers, which span more than 40 years. In his previous 
defense contractor job, he traveled extensively overseas, often carrying classified materials with him in much the same fashion as at issue here. All of these trips 
occurred without incident. MC 4 is applicable to the stolen car event because Applicant took significant corrective measures to eradicate any adverse impacts on 
the exercise for which the lost materials were to be used, and he made all possible notifications to the appropriate authorities. Regarding the 1996 telephone 
violation, Applicant put himself on report when he vented aloud his frustration at not having the resources needed to adhere to proper procedures. Further, co-workers with a wealth of experience in matters such as this have strongly recommended Applicant keep his clearance despite knowing that these three 
violations are in his background. In light of all available information on this issue, Applicant is not likely to commit future violations and can be relied on to 
abide by any and all procedures intended for the protection of classified materials. Accordingly, I conclude Guideline K for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has also expressed concerns, based on these same facts, about Applicant's judgment and reliability (SOR &para; 2.a). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a security 
concern arises where it is shown an applicant has exhibited questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness 
to comply with rules and regulations. Such conduct may indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="04-01625.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The record evidence shows 
Applicant was involved in three security violations. However, as discussed above, only one violation involved any initiative by Applicant. He took classified 
information home with him as a matter of convenience when he traveled overseas. Of the listed disqualifying conditions under this guideline, only DC 5<A HREF="04-01625.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> 
warrants consideration based on these facts. However, for the same reasons I concluded under Guideline K that the violations in this case were infrequent, I also 
conclude they do not constitute any pattern of rules violations. While the government may be generally concerned about Applicant's judgment because of the 
three incidents in Applicant's background, there are no specific disqualifying conditions applicable here. For the same reasons discussed under Guideline K, 
above, I conclude Guideline E for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="04-01625.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> of the entire record before me shows the government properly expressed reasonable doubts about Applicant's suitability 
to have access to classified information. The SOR was based on sufficient, reliable information about three security violations attributable to Applicant. Such 
issues bear directly on an applicant's ability to protect classified information, and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in 
whom the government entrusts its interests. However, when considered in light of the entire record, the inadvertent and infrequent nature of these events, the 
fact the last violation occurred nearly six years ago, and Applicant's long history of properly safeguarding classified information in a variety of circumstances 
are sufficient to mitigate the security concerns expressed in this SOR. Available information shows it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant's access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
