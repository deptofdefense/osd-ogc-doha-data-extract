<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>On October 5, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR alleged facts
under Guideline B (foreign influence), detailing reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>In a written statement, dated November 4, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR,  and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on
March 27, 2005.  Notice of the hearing was issued May 12, 2005, scheduling the hearing for June 2, 2005.  The hearing was held as scheduled.  The transcript

<P> 
Eligibility for a security clearance may be adjudicated using the  security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative factors listed in ¶ 6.3 of the
Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the
applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or
presence of rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="04-07153.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.<A HREF="04-07153.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="04-07153.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  An applicant
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="04-07153.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has
access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a
compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as
his or his own.  The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for
access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="04-07153.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or
inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial
security decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security
clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence as a whole,  I find the following guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case: Guideline B (foreign
influence) Directive, ¶ E2.A2.1.1. <EM> A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including acohabitants, and other persons to whom he or
she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject  to duress. These situations could create the
potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in
other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</EM> </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER>
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Applicant admitted that he had  numerous immediate family members living in the PRC, including four immediate family members who are members of the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP).  In addition, common sense suggests that the stronger the ties of affection or obligation, the more vulnerable a person is to
being manipulated if the relative, cohabitant, or close associate is brought under control or used as a hostage by a foreign intelligence or security service.  Here,
based on the record as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline B.  Applicant has close family ties to the PRC, as evidenced by his sisters
and brothers and their spouses who are citizens of and residents in the PRC. The strength of the ties is also demonstrated by Applicant traveling to the PRC for
family visits and frequent and regular telephone and internet contact with family members.  These circumstances raise a security concern under DC 1,
E2.A2.1.2.1. <EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in,
a foreign country</EM>.<EM></EM></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I  reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline B and conclude none apply. The only MC deserving serious consideration is MC 1,  E2.A2.1.3.1. <EM>A
determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not
agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s)
involved</EM> <EM>and the United States</EM> but it does not apply. It appears that none of the family members in PRC are agents of the PRC government or any other foreign
power. The term "foreign power" includes political parties and entities controlled by the government.<A HREF="04-07153.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  But that does not end the analysis, as Applicant must
show his family members in the PRC are not in positions to be exploited by the PRC government. Applicant's family members either work or worked  for a
government entity or rely on a government pension and thus could easily be exploited by the PRC government.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In deciding if an applicant has met the second prong of MC 1, it is proper to consider how the foreign country at issue is governed. The focus is not the country
or its people, but its rulers and the nature of the government they impose.  The PRC is hostile to the U.S. and is ruled by a communist government with a poor
record of human rights. With this history it is not difficult to envision a scenario in which Applicant's siblings could be subjected to some or all of these
arbitrary denial of basic human rights in an effort to put pressure on him to divulge classified information. We also know the PRC is actively pursuing industrial
and military intelligence in this country. Given these circumstances--which are clearly beyond Applicant's control--the presence of Applicant's siblings and
father in the PRC places them at risk of being brought under control or used as a hostage by a PRC intelligence or security service. Unfortunately, his siblings
and their spouses are in a position where there is a potential for them to be exploited in a way that could force him to choose between loyalty to his family
members and the interests of the U.S. This particularly is true of his two sisters and two brothers-in-law who are members of the Communist Party.  One of the
PRC's strategic initiatives is structural materials, special function materials, composites, rare-earth materials, new energy compound materials, and high
capacity engineering plastics with research being conducted at research "think tanks."<A HREF="04-07153.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  Half of his family either currently or has worked for mining or
metallurgical institutions.  Accordingly, Applicant is unable to successfully mitigate the security concern, and Guideline B is decided against him. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To conclude, Applicant has failed to meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. But this decision should not be construed
as an indictment of Applicant's loyalty and patriotism to the U.S., as those matters are not at issue. Instead, the clearly-consistent standard requires I resolve any
doubt against Applicant, and his close family ties to the PRC create doubt about his security suitability. In reaching my decision, I have considered the record
evidence as a whole, the whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and the appropriate factors and guidelines in the Directive.</SPAN></P>
