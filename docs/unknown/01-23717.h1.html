<P>The Applicant's mother is a citizen of Malta living in the U.S.  The Applicant lived in Malta for 15 years and has relatives who still live there.  The record 
evidence is sufficient to mitigate or extenuate the negative security implications stemming from the citizenship and location of her relatives.  Clearance is 
granted. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 15, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-23717.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 
September 10, 2002, the Applicant requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on January 8, 2003.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on January 23, 2003, 
scheduling the hearing, which was held on February 18, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>The Government's case consisted of two exhibits (Gov Ex).  The Applicant relied on her own testimony, that of her father, and five documents. (App Ex). The 
transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was received on February 28, 2003. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>The SOR alleges foreign influence (Guideline B).  She admits having relatives in friends who live in Malta and denies she would not defend the United States 
in the event of a conflict with Malta.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant is 28 years old, has worked for a defense contractor since December 2000, and is seeking a security clearance. She is an intelligent, loyal, honest, 
hard-working individual with strong moral values. (App Exs C, E) She is a diligent worker who exhibits the highest ethical standards. (Gov Ex D)</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's father is a U.S. citizen who worked as an industrial engineer for an international oil company and traveled frequently.  The Applicant's mother 
is a citizen of Malta,<A HREF="01-23717.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> who has lived in the U.S. as a registered alien since July 1994.  Her mother is not an agent of a foreign government or in a position to be 
exploited by a foreign power. The Applicant has been a U.S. citizen since her birth in 1974 and has never been a dual citizen.  From age 4 through 19 the 
Applicant lived in Malta with her mother's family.  From age five to 16 she attended private school and from age 16 to 18 she attended public school.  In 1994, 
the Applicant came to the U.S. to live permanently and to attend college.  Before leaving Malta, she worked summers in an ice cream parlor and at a pizza 
restaurant. After receiving her bachelor's and master's degrees, she married an American, and secured her current job with a defense contractor. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant's grandparents are citizens and residences of Malta. She receives birthday cards from them as well as infrequent letters, and telephone calls on 
special occasions. Her contact with them is approximately twelve times a year.  Her grandfather is a retired public works architect. Her grandmother was a 
home maker who did not work outside of the home. She has limited contact with her great aunts, who do call her on her birthday.  One great-aunt is a retired 
travel agent; the other is a Catholic nun.  Her uncle was also an architect.  She has no contact with her cousins: one is a student and the other a newspaper 
photographer. She has other relatives living in Malta to whom she is not close.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant's best friend, a citizen and resident of Malta,  works for a beverage company. While in school, her friend worked as a clerk at the water 
department.  She receives or sends e-mail to this person once a week</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant has never accepted or sought any special benefits or privileges from a foreign country nor is she entitled to any.  She has never voted in a foreign 
election, served in a foreign military, or worked for a foreign government. She does not own any foreign property nor does she maintain a foreign bank account. 
When her relatives in Malta pass away, she might or might not inherit property or money. The Applicant states her total and undivided allegiance is to the U.S. 
(Tr. 25) She has always been a U.S. citizen and is proud of it.  Her home, car, and 401(K) plan are in the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In a sworn statement (Gov Ex 2) give In September 2001, the Applicant stated she would defend the U.S. against any aggressor with the exception of Malta in 
which se would not want to be involved on either country's side as she would not want to harm either country.  At the hearing the Applicant had reflected on 
her previous statement and said, if the U.S. went to war against Malta, the Applicant would support the U.S. unconditionally. (Tr. 27) Should such an event 
occur, she would be concerned about her relatives in Malta and their safety, but the Applicant would stand by the U.S. in all crises, including policies that might 
adversely affect Malta, and would never veer from this conviction. (Tr. 28)</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not only has the 
burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts must have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance 
is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  Foreign Influence (Guideline B) The Concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to 
whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial 
interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  
E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include (E2.A2.1.2.):</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country; E2.A2.1.2.1. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">1. A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are 
not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
person(s) involved and the United States. E2.A2.1.3.1. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">3.  Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent. E2.A2.1.3.3.</SPAN></P>

</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." As 
Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Id.</EM> 484 U.S. at 527.  The President has restricted 
eligibility for access to classified information to "United States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United 
States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential 
for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Executive Order 12968, 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines 
contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See Egan</EM>, at 531. All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant then has the burden of establishing her security suitability with substantial evidence in 
explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue her security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See </EM>Executive Orders 10865 &sect; 2 and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">12968 &sect; 3.1(b). "Any 
doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive &para;

Doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline B, Foreign Influence. Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an 
individual's immediate family, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States, 
reside in a foreign country, or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of 
classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Government established </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">the Applicant's mother is a citizen of Malta and she has other relatives and friends who are citizens and 
residents of Malta. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1<A HREF="01-23717.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN> applies. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Although the Government established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case against her, she has nevertheless, successfully mitigated those security concerns. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Neither her mother 
nor her other relatives are agents of a foreign power and Applicant is not in a position to be exploited by them such that Applicant would be forced to choose 
between her loyalty to her family and the U.S. </SPAN>Mitigating condition (MC) 1<A HREF="01-23717.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN> applies. The Applicant has always been a U.S. citizen and has never been a citizen 
of Malta. Additionally, her contact with her grandparents, great aunts, uncle and cousin are infrequent. MC 3<A HREF="01-23717.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN> applies to these individuals. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After observing and 
hearing the Applicant, I am convinced that her family members do not represent a credible security risk to this nation.  I find for the Applicant as to SOR 
subparagraph 1.a. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant may, at some future date, inherit property from relatives who currently are residents of Malta. The possibility of inheritance is purely speculative 
and, in this instance, to have no security relevance. An Applicant does not have a financial stake in a country merely because they may inherit property some 
time in the future. See ISCR Case No. 97-0403 at page 3 (Appeal Board decision May 13, 1998) </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>The Applicant has expressed concern for her family members should they ever be in a war.  This natural concern for the safety of family in times of danger does 
not rise to the level of a security concern.  The Applicant has clearly expressed should the U.S. ever go to war with Malta, she would support the U.S. 
unconditionally. (Tr. 27) The Applicant has credibly testified she would stand by the U.S. in all crises, including policies that might have an adverse effect on 
alta, and would never veer from this conviction. (Tr. 28)  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find for the Applicant as to SOR subparagraph 1.b. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the 
circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </P>
