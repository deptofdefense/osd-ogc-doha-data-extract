<P>Applicant falsified a January 2002 security clearance questionnaire (SF 86) by deliberately omitting his 1997 arrest for driving under the influence of a 
controlled substance and his use of marijuana. During a subject interview with a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent in July 2002, Applicant deliberately 
falsified facts and circumstances of his 1997 arrest and of his use of marijuana. He has failed to mitigate the resulting security concerns under Guideline E 
(personal conduct) and Guideline J (criminal conduct). Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Having reviewed the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to 
make a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="02-27686.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance.  On November 14, 2003, DOHA 
issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline E (personal conduct) 
and Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant timely answered the SOR (Answer), admitted all of the allegations, and requested a hearing. </P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on August 5, 2004, and I convened a hearing December 13, 2004.<A HREF="02-27686.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The parties appeared as scheduled and the government 
presented five exhibits (GE 1 through 5), which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on 
December 21, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 27 years old and is a seagoing employee of a civilian shipping company which supports military sealift and logistics missions. When he hired on 
with that company in January 2002, he submitted an SF 86 to obtain a security clearance required to perform his duties. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began smoking marijuana in high school. His last known use of marijuana was on October 9, 1997, when Applicant smoked marijuana with some 
friends. Later that day, he was pulled over by police who had observed Applicant driving erratically. The police officer noted Applicant's red eyes and slurred 
speech and administered a field sobriety test, which Applicant failed. He also administered a breathalyser test, which Applicant passed because he had not 
consumed alcohol. During the field tests, Applicant told police he had smoked marijuana earlier that day. Applicant was taken to a police station where he 
submitted to a urinalysis test. He tested positive for marijuana and was charged with driving under the influence of a controlled substance (DUI). After several 
court dates and continuances, Applicant pled guilty to reckless driving in August 2000.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his SF 86, Applicant provided detailed information about a number of different facets of his personal background; however, in response to question 24, 
which asked if he had ever been charged with a drug- or alcohol-related crime, Applicant deliberately omitted his 1997 DUI arrest. In response to question 27, 
regarding illegal drug involvement over the preceding seven years, Applicant denied any illegal drug use.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 16, 2002, Applicant was interviewed by a DSS agent about various aspects of his background, including prior arrests, illegal drug use, and omissions 
from his SF 86. Applicant deliberately falsified the circumstances of his DUI arrest, insisting that he had not smoked marijuana that day. Instead, he claimed the 
presence of marijuana in his blood stream was the result of second-hand smoke and that he had never used illegal drugs before. Applicant knew during the 
interview that all of these representations were false. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="02-27686.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Security clearance 
decisions must reflect consideration of both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of 
each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines 
should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified 
information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, specifically, that Applicant deliberately omitted relevant and material information from his SF 
86 and perpetuated those falsifications in a subject interview with DSS, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are Guideline E 
(personal conduct) and Guideline J (criminal conduct).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="02-27686.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted 
facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the 
Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no 
one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="02-27686.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information enters into a 
fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant 
possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with 
the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="02-27686.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a security concern arises where it is shown an applicant has exhibited  questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such conduct may indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified 
information.<A HREF="02-27686.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Here, the government questions Applicant's trustworthiness because it appears he has deliberately omitted from his SF 86 a drug-related arrest 
(SOR 1.a) and the fact he used marijuana during the preceding seven years. (SOR 1.b) The government also alleges Applicant deliberately made false 
statements during a DSS interview and in a signed, sworn statement attendant to that interview. (SOR 1.c)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Through Applicant's Answer, his testimony at hearing, and five documentary exhibits, the government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification 
under Guideline E. The established facts support application of disqualifying condition (DC) 2<A HREF="02-27686.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 3.<A HREF="02-27686.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> At hearing, Applicant again admitted to deliberately 
falsifying his SF 86 and his statements to DSS; however, he did not present sufficient evidence to support any of the Guideline E mitigating conditions. 
Accordingly, I conclude the SOR allegations under Guideline E against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concern under Guideline J is that someone who willingly disregards the law may also disregard rules and procedures intended to safeguard 
classified information. Applicant's deliberate falsification of his SF 86 and his statements to DSS constitute violations of 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001. Because the 
government has established Applicant intended to deceive or mislead the government, it has also established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification for criminal 
conduct. Guideline J DC 1<A HREF="02-27686.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 2<A HREF="02-27686.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply here. By contrast, none of the listed mitigating conditions apply. Again, Applicant has not presented information 
sufficient to support application of any of the listed mitigating conditions. The conduct was recent in that it is part of the current investigation and adjudication 
of Applicant's request for clearance; each falsification was a separate criminal act, so his criminal conduct cannot be deemed isolated; and Applicant did not 
engage in the conduct in question unwillingly or under duress. Lastly, Applicant's apologies for lying about his past do not suffice to show clear evidence of 
rehabilitation. On balance, I conclude Guideline J against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the available evidence, and I have applied the appropriate disqualifying and mitigating conditions. Further, I have tried to make a 
fair and commonsense assessment of the record before me as required by Directive Section E2.2.3. This record raises reasonable and persistent doubts about 
Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government 
entrusts its interests. Absent substantial information to mitigate these doubts, which Applicant failed to provide, I cannot conclude he has overcome the 
government's case.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
