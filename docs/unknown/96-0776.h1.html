</P>

<P>	On 24 October 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary
affirmative finding<A HREF="96-0776.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant. On 11 November 1996, Applicant answered the SOR and
requested an administrative decision on the record. Applicant did not respond to the
Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM)--issued 16 December 1996; the record in this
case closed 1 February 1997, the day the response was due at DOHA. The case was originally
assigned to a different Administrative Judge on 20 February 1997, but was reassigned to me on
17 March 1997 because of caseload considerations. I received the case on 17 March 1997 to
determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</P>

<P>	The SOR is attached to this Decision and incorporated by reference.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Applicant admitted the original allegations of the SOR; accordingly, I incorporate the
admissions as findings of fact.</P>

<P>	Applicant is a 27-year old employee of a defense contractor seeking a secret clearance.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	On 16 October 1995, Applicant falsified a National Agency Questionnaire (NAQ)(DD
Form 398-2)(Item 4) when he answered "no" to questions designed to elicit his drug abuse
history. On 7 May 1996, Applicant falsified a sworn statement to the Defense Investigative
Service (Item 6) when he understated his marijuana use, omitted his other drug use, and claimed
to have last used marijuana in 1990.<A HREF="96-0776.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  He also falsely asserted that his two arrests in September
1989 and September 1992 did not involve drug activity by Applicant, but by Applicant's
companions. Applicant did not disclose the full extent of his drug abuse until he was confronted
with a second subject interview on 27 August 1996 (Item 5): Applicant first used marijuana in
1983, and used it daily from 1983 to 1984; after refraining from use from 1984 to 1986, he
resumed daily use from 1986 to 1989. From 1989 to June 1996, he experienced periods where he
used marijuana weekly, but had times where he did not use the drug for six months. From
January 1995 to June 1996, he used marijuana three or four times a year, the last time in June
1996. He bought marijuana weekly between 1983 and 1989, spending $40.00 for one-quarter
ounce. From 1989 to 1993, he bought small amounts of marijuana; he has not bought marijuana
since 1993. He successfully cultivated marijuana five or six times between 1988 and Spring
1995; he dried the marijuana for his own use, although he sold one plant for $100.00 on one
occasion between 1987 and 1993. He also sold one-quarter ounce of marijuana on two other
occasions during the same period, making a small profit each time. In the approximate period
1984 to 1989, Applicant used and purchased hashish and LSD; he also used PCP. Applicant also
disclosed that the September 1989 and 1992 arrests did concern his drug involvement; he was not
just an innocent bystander to other's misconduct.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	Applicant falsified his NAQ an<FONT SIZE="-1">d</FONT> 7 May 1996 sworn statement because he feared that he
would not obtain his security clearance and would lose his job. Friends had advised him to not
disclose his drug abuse history.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in
evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account
the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and
circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in
Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a
particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as
the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </P>

<P>	Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most
pertinent to this case:</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>DRUG INVOLVEMENT (CRITERION H)</STRONG></U> </CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's
willingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair
social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified
information.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(1) any drug abuse;</P>

<P>		(2) illegal drug possession, including cultivation . . . purchase, sale . . . </P>

<P>    	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		(1) the drug involvement was not recent.</P>

<P>		(3) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>PERSONAL CONDUCT (CRITERION E)</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not
properly safeguard classified information.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(2) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts
		from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar
form 		used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or 		trustworthiness. . .;</P>

<P>		(3) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and
		material matters to an investigator, . . . in connection with a personnel security or 		trustworthiness determination;</P>

<P>	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		None.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>CRIMINAL CONDUCT (CRITERION J)</STRONG></U></CENTER>
	</P>

<P>	A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment,
reliability  and trustworthiness.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(1) any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</P>

<P>	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		None.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.
If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to
establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient
to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise
doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden
of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under criterion H. Applicant's extensive history of
drug abuse raises serious doubts about his fitness for access to classified information. His use and
purchase of hashish and LSD, and his use of PCP, are sufficiently remote to suggest that he will not
use these drugs in the future. However, his use of marijuana presents a different question.
Applicant's use of marijuana is more extensive than his use of other drugs, and more recent. While
the Applicant stated an intent to not use drugs in the future, he had made a similar statement on his
sworn statement in May 1996--yet used marijuana in June 1996. He did so knowing that his drug
use was contrary to both company and DoD drug policy. His two arrests in September 1989 and
1992 clearly involve Applicant's drug involvement and association with individuals involved in sale
of drugs. Applicant's own manufacture and sale of marijuana are not sufficiently remote to conclude
that they are unlikely to recur. On these facts, I conclude that it is too early to determine that
Applicant's drug abuse is completely behind him. I find criterion H. against Applicant.</P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under Criteria E. The information sought by the
Government on the NAQ and during the subject interview was relevant and material to the
Government's investigation of the Applicant's fitness for access to classified information, and the
Applicant knowingly and wilfully falsified that information. Each time, Applicant disclosed only
so much of his drug history as he thought would get by the DIS. The Applicant's failure to fully
disclose his drug abuse history until he was confronted with a second subject interview suggests that
he cannot be relied upon to speak the truth if the truth presents possible adverse consequences for
his own interests. Although Applicant claims that he falsified several of the documents on the advice
of others, I find that Applicant did not rely on such advice in good faith. He knew the answers he
provided were false; and indeed he knew the answers had to be false for him to get what he
wanted--a security clearance. At no time did Applicant make any effort to fully disclose his drug
abuse history, much less a prompt, good faith effort. I find criterion E. against the Applicant.</P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under Criteria J. The Applicant's knowing, multiple
falsifications to an agency of the federal government on matters within that agency's jurisdiction
clearly violate 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001. The falsifications had the potential to influence the course of the
background investigation--in areas of legitimate concern to the Government. I find criterion J.
against the Applicant.</P>
