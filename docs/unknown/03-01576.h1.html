Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P>

while possessing a security clearance . . .?" Applicant answered  "No" to question #27. She failed to provide the information that she used marijuana during the 
period in which she possessed a security clearance, which was granted to her in 1994.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P>

not find her explanation, that she simply forgot that she had ever used marijuana credible, particularly since she had received her clearance in 1994, and should 
have known, at that time, the Government's absolute prohibition against using any illegal substance while holding a clearance.  She also claimed that the 
marijuana was not something of which she was proud, and it made her feel sick  (Exhibit 6). Based on these statements, I conclude that it is unlikely that 
Applicant forgot that she used marijuana while possessing a security clearance.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. 
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">As set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider 
the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly<STRONG> </STRONG>consistent<STRONG> </STRONG>with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day. The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's 
part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot 
draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive 
Order 10865, "Any determination under this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."<STRONG>    </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance. This the Applicant has not done.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that Applicant has financial irresponsibility, (Guideline F), that she 
has used illegal drugs, (Guideline H), and that she has exhibited poor judgement and untrustworthy behavior, (Guideline E). Applicant, on the other hand, has 
not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against her regarding 
Guidelines F and E.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>(Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly establishes Applicant's indebtedness. It shows Applicant has a long 
history of financial difficulties,</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">and there is no evidence that Applicant has learned how to handle her finances now any better than she did in the past. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to her financial obligations falls within Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (DC) (E2.A6.1.2.1.), and DC 
(E2.A6.1.2.3.), a history of not meeting financial obligations, and an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. I find that no Mitigating Condition (MC) is 
applicable to this case. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Until Applicant makes a good-faith effort to resolve her debts, and she can establish a record of financial responsibility and stability, security concerns will 
continue to exist under Guideline F. I resolve Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>(Guideline H - Drug Involvement) </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">With respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its initial case. Applicant's improper and illegal drug abuse is of concern, especially in light of her 
desire to have access to the nation's secrets.  The fact that Applicant used illegal substances, while holding a security clearance, must also be considered 
adversely to Applicant. Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to her illegal substance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement DC (E2.A8.1.2.1.), <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">any drug 
abuse</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and DC (E2.A8.1.2.2.), </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Based on the fact that Applicant only used  marijuana one time in 1998, I conclude that Applicant's conduct comes within MC (E2.A8.1.3.1.), the drug 
involvement was not recent. and  MC (E2.A8.1.3.2.), the drug involvement was isolated.  MC (E2.A8.1.3.3.) also applies because of Applicant's stated 
intention not to continue using marijuana in the future. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that Applicant used an illegal drug under Guideline H. Applicant, has 
introduced evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation. Under this Guideline, the mitigation is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against her.  
Accordingly, Paragraph 2, Guideline H, is concluded for Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant furnished to the Government less than complete, honest answers, regarding her marijuana 
usage, especially while holding a security clearance, in a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">SCA, completed  on January 17, 2002.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to our nation's secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies 
material facts or fails to furnish relevant information to a Government investigator, it is extremely difficult to conclude that she nevertheless possesses the 
judgment, and honesty necessary for an individual given a clearance. In this case, there has been no reasonable explanation for Applicant's failure to inform the 
Government about her drug usage. I conclude that Applicant knowingly and willingly failed to give complete, honest answers to the Government.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In reviewing the DCs under Guideline E, I conclude that DC (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A5.1.2.2.) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">applies</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> because </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> deliberately provided false and  misleading information
