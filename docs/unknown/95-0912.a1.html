<P ALIGN="CENTER"><EM>Pro se</EM></P>

<P>Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski issued a decision, dated September 18, 1996, in which she concluded it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Department Counsel appealed. For the reasons set forth below, the Board reverses the
Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as
amended.</P>

<P>Department Counsel's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge made factual findings that are not supported by substantial
evidence; (2) whether the Administrative Judge deviated from the Adjudicative Guidelines without adequate explanation; and (3) whether the Administrative
Judge's favorable security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated January 22, 1996 to Applicant. The SOR was based on Criterion D
(Sexual behavior) and Criterion G (Alcohol consumption).</P>

<P>A hearing was held on July 23, 1996. The Administrative Judge subsequently issued a written decision in which she concluded it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The case is before the Board on Department Counsel's appeal from that favorable
decision.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG><A HREF="95-0912.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A></P>

<P>1. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge made factual findings that are not supported by substantial evidence</U>. Department Counsel contends the Administrative
Judge made certain factual findings that are not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, Department Counsel challenges the following factual findings:
(a) Applicant intends to continue monthly counseling after December 1996; and (b) Applicant's friends at work are aware of his sexual exhibitionism.</P>

<P>On appeal, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might
accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record. In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference
to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge." Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 32.a. Whether there is sufficient record evidence
to support a Judge's factual findings is a question of law, not a question of fact. <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, DOHA Case No. 95-0904 (November 15, 1996) at p. 3.</P>

<P>(a) The record shows that health care professionals are of the opinion that Applicant has a condition that involves a relapse rate of approximately 15% even after
completion of treatment,<A HREF="95-0912.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> that he needs to continue counseling and treatment for a few more years,<A HREF="95-0912.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> and that if he stopped receiving therapy he would be at
risk for relapse.<A HREF="95-0912.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> The record shows that Applicant was cited in January 1995 for violating probation because he failed to follow through with court-ordered
counseling.<A HREF="95-0912.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> Moreover, Applicant testified: "I expect to still stay in weekly sessions until December [1996], and then we might go until a month later;
something like that. You can't stay dependent forever."<A HREF="95-0912.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> Applicant also said: "There is nothing that can make me stay in treatment, can make me continue to
take my medication; it's just nothing there to make me do that. So, if you need guarantees, there isn't any available; just that I finally became sick and tired of
being sick and tired, and I'm going to make things work in my life for the rest -- well, as long as I can."<A HREF="95-0912.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A></P>

<P>In view of the foregoing, the Board concludes there is insufficient evidence to support the Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant intends to continue
monthly counseling.</P>

<P>(b) There is conflicting record evidence on whether Applicant's friends at work are aware of his sexual exhibitionism. When faced with conflicting record
evidence, the Administrative Judge must consider and weigh such evidence and make factual findings. Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Board
concludes the Judge's finding on this point is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. There is sufficient record evidence to support the Judge's finding
despite the contrary evidence cited by Department Counsel on appeal.</P>

<P>2. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge deviated from the Adjudicative Guidelines without adequate explanation</U>. Department Counsel contends the
Administrative Judge impermissibly deviated from the Adjudicative Guidelines. In support of this contention, Department Counsel argues: (a) the record
evidence does not support the Judge's application of Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders Mitigating Guideline 2; (b) the Judge failed to address
Criminal Conduct Mitigating Guideline 3; and (c) the Judge failed to apply Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders Disqualifying Guideline 2.</P>

<P>(a) The Administrative Judge found that the record evidence did not support application of Sexual Behavior Mitigating Guideline 1,<A HREF="95-0912.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A> Sexual Behavior
itigating Guideline 2,<A HREF="95-0912.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A> or Criminal Conduct Mitigating Guideline 2.<A HREF="95-0912.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP>(10)</SUP></A> The Judge noted that Criminal Conduct Mitigating Guideline 5 required "clear
evidence of rehabilitation" and that Applicant was still on probation. The Judge then decided that the Adjudicative Guidelines for Emotional, Mental, and
Personality Disorders were pertinent because Applicant's sexual misconduct was attributable to an underlying mood disorder rather than a criminal
predisposition. Analyzing Applicant's conduct under the Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders Adjudicative Guidelines, the Judge concluded Mitigating
Guidelines 1<A HREF="95-0912.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP>(11)</SUP></A> and 3<A HREF="95-0912.a1.html#N_12_"><SUP>(12)</SUP></A> were not applicable, but that Applicant satisfied Mitigating Guideline 2<A HREF="95-0912.a1.html#N_13_"><SUP>(13)</SUP></A> despite his need for ongoing treatment. The Judge cited
Applicant's record of cooperation with his treatment regimen and his intention to remain in therapy to support her application of Mitigating Guideline 2.</P>

<P>The Adjudicative Guidelines explicitly authorize an adjudicator to consider the guidelines pertaining to Criminal Conduct and Emotional, Mental, and
Personality Disorders in analyzing the security concerns raised by sexual misconduct. <EM>See</EM> Directive, Enclosure 2 at page 2-10, footnote.<A HREF="95-0912.a1.html#N_14_"><SUP>(14)</SUP></A> However,
Department Counsel persuasively argues that the Administrative Judge's application of Emotional Mental, and Personality Disorders Mitigating Guideline 2 was
in error. As discussed earlier, there is not sufficient record evidence to support the Judge's finding that Applicant intends to remain in therapy. Moreover, there is
record evidence that Applicant has been less than fully compliant with the court-ordered requirement that he undergo counseling. Since two key findings used
by the Judge to support her application of Mitigating Guideline 2 cannot be sustained, her reasoning for applying that Mitigating Guideline cannot be upheld on
appeal.</P>

<P>(b) Department Counsel also argues the Administrative Judge improperly conflated Sexual Behavior Mitigating Guideline 3<A HREF="95-0912.a1.html#N_15_"><SUP>(15)</SUP></A> and Emotional, Mental, and
Personality Disorders Mitigating Guideline 2.<A HREF="95-0912.a1.html#N_16_"><SUP>(16)</SUP></A> As discussed earlier, the Judge's application of Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders Mitigating
Guideline 2 is not sustainable in this case. Therefore, it is unnecessary for the Board to decide whether that Mitigating Guideline could be applied in this case
instead of Sexual Behavior Mitigating Guideline 3.</P>

<P>(c) Department Counsel argues the Administrative Judge should have applied Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders Disqualifying Guideline 2<A HREF="95-0912.a1.html#N_17_"><SUP>(17)</SUP></A>
because of evidence that Applicant refused to follow treatment recommendations in late 1994-early 1995. That argument is persuasive.</P>

<P>An Administrative Judge must apply pertinent Adjudicative Guidelines. <EM>See</EM> Directive, Section F.3. Where there is evidence that supports application of a
particular Adjudicative Guideline, the Judge must apply it or provide an adequate explanation why a deviation from that Guideline is warranted under the
particular facts of the case. <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 95-0560 (August 16, 1996) at p. 3; ISCR Case No. 94-0964 (January 29, 1996) at pp. 5-6. Here, the Judge
did neither with respect to Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders Disqualifying Guideline 2. Accordingly, the Judge erred by not applying Disqualifying
Guideline 2 in this case.</P>

<P>3. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge's favorable security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</U>. Department Counsel contends the
Administrative Judge's favorable security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law because it is not supported by the record evidence. In
support of this contention, Department Counsel argues: (a) the record evidence does not support a conclusion that Applicant has been cooperative with treatment
or that his treatment has been successfully completed; (b) the record evidence does not support the Judge's finding that Applicant intends to continue in therapy
for the period of time that health care professionals have indicated he needs to; and (c) the Judge's favorable decision is not sustainable under the Adjudicative
Guidelines.</P>

<P>As discussed above, the record evidence does not support the Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant intends to remain in therapy for the period of time
recommended by health care professionals. Moreover, as discussed above, the Judge committed some errors with respect to her application of the Adjudicative
Guidelines in this case. Considering the record as a whole, the Judge's errors warrant reversal.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>CONCLUSION</STRONG></P>

<P>Department Counsel has met its burden of demonstrating error below that warrants reversal. Accordingly, pursuant to Item 33.c. of the Additional Procedural
Guidance, the Appeal Board reverses the Administrative Judge's September 18, 1996 decision.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>DISSENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE MICHAEL Y. RA'ANAN</STRONG> </P>

<P>Much of the basis for reversal in this case is found in the Administrative Judge's understanding that the Applicant intends to continue therapy on a monthly
basis. The majority does not find such a meaning in the Applicant's testimony. To be sure, the testimony in question is neither clear nor eloquent. However, the
Administrative Judge was there when the Applicant testified and I can believe that she understood the Applicant's intention in a way that the transcript reflects
poorly, if at all. The Applicant now argues that her understanding is correct, while Department Counsel argues that the Administrative Judge erred. If I was
certain that the Administrative Judge's understanding was incorrect, I would probably join the majority. I am not certain that the Administrative Judge is wrong,
though.</P>

<P>If the Administrative Judge's understanding of the Applicant's intention is correct than her application of a key mitigating factor is justified and the majority's
decision to reverse is in error.</P>

<P>Also, the Applicant's recent history is one of compliance with treatment recommendations. The majority concludes that a disqualifying factor ought to be
applied because of a two year old failure to comply with treatment recommendations. I am persuaded that that event is no longer pertinent to an analysis of
Applicant's situation.</P>
