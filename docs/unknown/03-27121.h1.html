<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 53 year-old naturalized United States citizen, born in the People's Republic of China (PRC).  Applicant's father and brother reside in Hong 
Kong, and are PRC citizens, because Hong Kong is under the control of the PRC. The evidence establishes that Applicant has extremely limited and infrequent 
contacts with these family members, neither of whom is involved with the PRC government.  He is not vulnerable to foreign influence </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">because of  his strong 
attachment to the United States and his family here, and because his family in PRC is not in a position to be exploited in a way that could force Applicant to 
choose between loyalty to these family members and his loyalty to the United States.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigation has been shown.  Clearance is granted.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 14, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 2, 2005. Applicant requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 11, 2005, the case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the 
parties on June 1, 2005, and the hearing was held on June 8, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 8) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered no documentary 
exhibit and offered his own testimony. The transcript (TR) was received on June 20, 2005. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B of the Directive because Applicant has immediate family 
members who are not United States citizens and  may be subject to duress. The SOR contains three allegations, 1.a., through </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c.,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under Guideline B. Applicant 
admitted all of the SOR allegations. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon 
due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 53 years old,  employed as an Instrumentation Engineer by a defense contractor, and he seeks a security clearance for that position.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He received a 
Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from a United States university in 1978. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was born in the PRC in 1951. In 1957 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">'s </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">father</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> moved, without his family, to Hong Kong to escape the Communist rule of the PRC. In 
1969, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> along with three other high school classmates, escaped the PRC, by riding their bicycles for approximately 40 miles and then swimming seven 
hours, until they arrived in Hong Kong. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> stayed in Hong Kong until 1973, when he moved to Canada to further his education. He moved to the United 
States in 1975, and became a naturalized United States citizen in 1984. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">'s wife is a Chinese born, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">United States citizen, who also escaped the PRC by swimming to Hong Kong. Applicant and his wife have one 26 year old 
daughter, who is a natural born United States citizen.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Additionally, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has two brothers and three sisters, who have become United States residents and 
citizens (Tr at 19).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father and  brother are </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">residents of Hong Kong. They are </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">citizens </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the PRC, as a result of Hong Kong reverting to the control of the PRC.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> His 
father is 92 years old and has been retired for many years. He worked as an independent businessman since he moved to Hong Kong. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">'s</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> brother is 
employed in Hong Kong as an executive for an American company.  Neither his father nor brother ever worked for or was associated with the Governments of 
Hong Kong or the PRC, and neither was ever a member of the Communist party (Tr at 26-28, 31.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant contacts his father and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">brother</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> by telephone approximately two times a year (Tr at 30-31). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant traveled to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Hong Kong </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">on three occasions between 2000 and 2001, to visit his ill step-mother, then to attend her funeral, and finally to visit his father 
(Tr at 29-30, 34). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified that he has no assets in Hong Kong or the PRC, and he estimates that his net worth in the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">United States</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is $800,000 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Tr at 30, 33-34)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When he was questioned as to what he would do if the Chinese Government threatened  his father or brother if he did not cooperate with the government,  he 
testified, "I would call security. Call FBI immediately. I would notify the Security." (Tr at 31).    </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">           Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative 
Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Each 
adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular 
condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this 
policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, etc. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant's father and brother are citizens </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> the PRC, which could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of 
classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security 
concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A>or continue a security clearance for him. This </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has done.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The evidence of existence of immediate family members, who are citizens of the PRC comes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1, immediate 
family members, or  persons to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, who are citizens of, or resident in, a foreign country.  The fact that 
the foreign country in question is the PRC, a country under Communist rule, is also of serious concern; but that fact is not automatically controlling. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The primary factors that I have considered in mitigation include: the lack of any government involvement of Applicant's father and brother in the PRC, and 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">'s</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">limited and infrequent contact with them, and the fact that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">'s wife, child, two brothers, and three </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">sister</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">s live in the United States and are 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">United States citizen</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">s. I have also considered Applicant's valiant effort to come to the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">United States</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, his long history since coming here, and his strong feelings 
concerning this country.  Based on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence,  I have determined that his family in the PRC do not 
constitute an unacceptable security risk, and Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A2.1.3.1, a determination that the immediate family members in question are not 
agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons 
involved and the United States, applies.  MC E2.A2.1.3.3. also applies because Applicant's contacts with his family in the PRC is casual and infrequent. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">         After considering all of the evidence of record on these issues, I conclude that the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the 
SOR, and even in the unlikely event pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would resist it and would  report the 
incident to the proper authorities. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Accordingly, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns, thereby demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant him a security 
clearance.<CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   </CENTER>
