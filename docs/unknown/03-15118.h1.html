<P>Applicant, a 26-year-old security guard, failed to mitigate drug, alcohol, criminal conduct, and personal conduct allegations since he continues to use marijuana 
and alcohol after a diagnosis of alcohol and marijuana abuse. He also failed to report his treatment for abuse on his security clearance application. Clearance is 
denied. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Information Within Industry, </EM>as amended and 
modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, 
as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated October 8, 2004, to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. It 
was received by Applicant on November 12, 2004. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement dated November 22, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on the 
written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on December 1, 2004. A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. 
Applicant did not do so and the case was assigned to me on May 18, 2005.  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR but offered some explanatory information in his response and interviews with the investigating officer. After a 
complete and thorough review of the information in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor working as a security guard. He has purchased and used marijuana since 1997. He was arrested in 
April, 2000, for marijuana possession and ordered into a drug and alcohol program. He participated in the program for two months but was discharged for poor 
attendance. He was diagnosed by the program with continuous alcohol abuse and continuous marijuana abuse. He continues to use marijuana and consume 
alcohol and expressed his intent to continue. </P> 
<P>Applicant failed to report the alcohol treatment and counseling at Question 20 on his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) dated December 30, 2002. 
Applicant denied that the omission was deliberate saying that he had forgotten about it and only remembered when the investigator brought it to his attention. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and</P> 
<P>maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the 
motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; 
E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive 
Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b)<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has cited Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1 under Guideline H concerning drug involvement as relevant to the proposed denial of a security 
clearance for the Applicant. Drug involvement is always a security concern because it raises questions about a person's willingness or ability to protect 
classified information. Any drug abuse is a condition that may be disqualifying. The following definition is provided: "Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug . . 
. ." (E2.A8.1.1.3) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include illegal drug possession, including purchase. (E2. A8.1.2.2.) 
No mitigating conditions are applicable in that the use continues with an intent to continue.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has cited a Disqualifying Condition (DC) pursuant to the Directive concerning alcohol consumption under Guideline G. This relates to 
excessive alcohol consumption leading to exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized 
disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. (E2.A7.1.1) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include evaluation 
of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. (E2.A7.1.2.4) No 
mitigating conditions are applicable in that Applicant continues to drink and intends to continue doing so. There is no positive changes in his behavior. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's arrest for criminal conduct raises issues under Guideline J (E2.A10.1.1) involving a history or pattern of criminal activity creating doubt about a 
person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. An admission of criminal conduct (E2.A10.1.2.1.) and a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses 
(E2.A10.1.2.2.) are potentially disqualifying conditions. I conclude that the allegation is not mitigated by the fact that it was not recent since he continues to use 
marijuana (E2.A10.1.3.1.), and it is not an isolated incident (E2.A10.1.3.2.) since the practice continues. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, Applicant's failure to report his alcohol treatment on his SF 86 indicates questionable judgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. (E2.A5.1.1.) Specifically, the deliberate 
omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a personnel security application could raise a security concern and be disqualifying. 
(E2.A5.1.2.2.); deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator in connection with a 
personnel security determination (E2.A5.1.2.3.); and a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. (E2.A5.1.2.5.) His statement that he forgot about the treatment 
and evaluation is not credible. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The "whole person" concept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits 
taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. After considering all the evidence in 
its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that the Applicant has offered no evidence to counter the proof and 
admission of the conduct that disqualify him from holding a security clearance and that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security 
clearance to him. </SPAN></P>
