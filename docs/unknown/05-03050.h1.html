<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant deliberately falsified his January 2002 clearance application by omitting his drug abuse history.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Clearance denied.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 18 July 2005 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of 
his clearance because of personal conduct and criminal conduct.<A HREF="05-03050.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He answered the SOR 9 August 2005, and requested a decision without hearing. He responded 
to DOHA's 25 October 2005 File of Relevant Material (FORM). The record closed 20 December 2005, when Department Counsel indicated no objection to the 
response. DOHA assigned the case to me 28 December 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR, but denied intent to falsify his clearance application when he misrepresented his criminal record. I incorporate 
his admissions as findings of fact. He is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a 42-year-old heavy equipment mechanic employed by a defense contractor since January  2002. He previously held a 
clearance during part of the time he was in the U.S. Army (1981-1997).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant applied for a clearance in January 2002, he omitted his cocaine use in October 1997 and his marijuana use from October 1997 to April 1998. 
During a Defense Security Service interview in May 2003, he admitted deliberately omitting his drug abuse  because he was afraid he would lose his job if he 
disclosed it on his clearance application. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 6 January 1998, Applicant was charged with two counts of assault arising out of a domestic dispute with his wife on 27 October 1997. He had threatened to 
kill her if she did not let him leave the family home. He also pushed her during the argument. However, the charging document incorrectly alleges that he 
assaulted himself on that occasion. Applicant had been drinking at the time.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 5 August 1998, Applicant was charged with two counts of assault arising out of another domestic dispute with his wife on 11 January 1998 when he hit both 
his wife and their 8-year-old son. Both Applicant and his wife had been drinking on this occasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Both assault incidents were adjudicated on 17 February 1999. The January 1998 assaults were dismissed. Applicant received probation before judgment for the 
August 1998 assault on his wife, conditioned on 36 months supervised probation and payment of fines and court costs; the assault on his son was nolle prossed.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On his clearance application, Applicant reported his probation before judgment (under the  February 1999 adjudication date) under pending charges (question 
23). He did not separately report the 27 October 1997 charges (under question 26). During his subject interview, he denied any intent to mislead the 
government, believing that because the two sets of charges were adjudicated the same day, they were all covered in his positive response to the pending charges 
question.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's supervisor considers him an excellent employee, and believes that he has learned his lesson from an otherwise unspecified "mistake he made in his 
personal life a number of years ago."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J 
(Criminal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="05-03050.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a Guideline E case and Applicant did not mitigate the conduct. He deliberately concealed his drug history from the government.<A HREF="05-03050.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
He did so because he feared he would not get the job or his clearance if he was truthful.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> While he disclosed his drug history during his May 2003 interview, he 
did not disclose the information before then and no evidence suggests he voluntarily disclosed the information before questioning or confrontation.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="05-03050.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's conduct demonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared personnel. The government has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse 
information about an Applicant before making a clearance decision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information. 
Further, an applicant's willingness to report adverse information about himself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security 
violations or other security concerns in the future, something the government relies on in order to perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of 
classified information. Applicant's conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government interests. I resolve Guideline E 
against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government also </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">established its case under Guideline J and the Applicant has only mitigated a portion of the security concerns.<A HREF="05-03050.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's deliberate 
falsification of his clearance application violates the provisions of 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001, and he provided insufficient mitigation of his conduct. However, the two 
assault incidents are mitigated as remote and isolated, having both occurred within three months nearly seven years ago. I conclude Guideline J against 
Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">However, I conclude that Applicant did not falsify his clearance application when he failed to separately disclose the October 1997 assault charges, because he lacked the intent to keep this 
information from the Government. Although he knew he had two sets of assault charges, he also knew that they had been adjudicated the same day. He might reasonably have believed that by 
reporting his probation before judgment he was reporting the full extent of his criminal conduct as required by the clearance application. Indeed, it would have been unreasonable for him to 
believe they would remain undiscovered once he reported the probation before judgment. Further, he reported two 1983 DUIs as required by the clearance application, the only other criminal 
conduct in his past.
