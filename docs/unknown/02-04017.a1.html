<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued the Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated July 14, 2003, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke Applicant's access to classified information.  The SOR was based upon Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations).  Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated November 14, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding against the Applicant with respect to the Guideline E 
allegation, (2) whether the Administrative Judged erred in concluding Applicant engaged in a deceptive financial practice, and</P> 
 
<P>(3) whether the Administrative Judge erred by failing to give sufficient weight to applicable mitigating conditions with respect to the Guideline F allegations.  
For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding against the Applicant with respect to the Guideline E allegation</SPAN>.  On appeal, Applicant argues that the 
Judge's finding with respect to the Guideline E allegation is erroneous because: 1) the Judge amended the allegation at the hearing to conform to the record 
evidence, 2) the finding is contrary to certain hearsay evidence acquired by the Applicant subsequent to the Judge's decision, and 3) the finding is based upon 
assumptions rather than on the record evidence.  For the reasons set forth below, we disagree and affirm the Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P>First, a judge may amend an SOR at the hearing on his own motion, or upon the motion of one of the parties, so as to render it in conformity with the evidence.  
<EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.17.  In this case, the amendment reasonably brought the SOR into conformity with the record 
evidence and it was made without objection from the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>Second, the Board may not consider new evidence on appeal. <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.</P> 
 
<P>Third, Applicant essentially argues that the Judge's finding with respect to the Guideline E allegation was based on assumptions, because it was contrary to 
Applicant's explanation at the hearing.  Applicant's explanation was relevant and material evidence that the Judge had to consider.  However, the Judge was not 
bound to accept Applicant's explanation at face value.  Rather, the Judge had to consider Applicant's explanation in light of the record evidence as a whole.  
<EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0430 (July 3, 2001) at pp. 4-5; ISCR Case No. 99-0473 (May 12, 2000) at pp.  2-3.  Given the record evidence in this case, the 
Judge's findings, that the Applicant deliberately used a false address to obtain lower, resident tuition rates at a college and that he still has a substantial 
outstanding debt on that tuition, reflect legally permissible inferences drawn from the record evidence.  Applicant's ability to argue for an alternative 
interpretation of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge's findings with respect to the Guideline E allegation are unsustainable.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR 
Case No. 01-19513 (January 22, 2004) at p. 4.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judged erred in concluding Applicant engaged in a deceptive financial practice</SPAN>.  On appeal, Applicant contends there is "no 
evidence that supports" the Judge's conclusion that Applicant engaged in a deceptive financial practice as contemplated under Financial Considerations 
Disqualifying Condition 1.<A HREF="02-04017.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 
<P>  We disagree and affirm the Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P>As noted above, there was sufficient record evidence for the Judge to find that Applicant deliberately used a false address to obtain lower, resident tuition rates 
at a college.  The Judge's subsequent conclusion that Applicant's conduct constituted a deceptive financial practice as contemplated under Financial 
Considerations Disqualifying Condition 1 was reasonable and sustainable.</P> 
 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by failing to give sufficient weight to applicable mitigating conditions with respect to the Guideline F allegations</SPAN>.  
On appeal, Applicant contends the Judge's conclusion with respect to the Guideline F allegation was unsupported by record evidence and that the security 
concerns raised by his indebtedness should have been mitigated by application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions 1,<A HREF="02-04017.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
<P> 2,<A HREF="02-04017.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
<P> and 6.<A HREF="02-04017.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
<P>  For the 
reasons set forth below, we disagree and affirm the Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P>It is clear from the Administrative Judge's findings of fact and conclusions that the Judge considered the evidence which the Applicant considers mitigating and 
concluded that it was not sufficient to overcome the security concerns raised by the Applicant's indebtedness.  The application of Adjudicative Guidelines 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them applies to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, the 
application of a disqualifying or mitigating condition requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case 
No. 01-14740 (January 15, 2003) at p. 7 (discussing various considerations that must be taken into account by an adjudicator when  applying Adjudicative 
Guidelines disqualifying or mitigating conditions). </P> 
 
<P>Given the fact that the indebtedness at issue had been incurred years earlier, but still not resolved as of the date of the hearing, it was not arbitrary or capricious 
for the Judge to conclude that Applicant's indebtedness was recent and that there was insufficient evidence for him to conclude that there were clear indications 
that the problem was under control.</P> 
 
<P>Likewise, the Board has previously discussed what constitutes a "good-faith" effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:</P> 
 
<P>In order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant's debts.  The Directive does not define the term 'good-faith.'  However, 
the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith 'requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and 
adherence to duty or obligation.'  ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at pp. 5-6.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>Given the fact that the debt was incurred in 1998, that the Applicant had made only token, irregular payments prior to the issuance of the SOR, and was past due 
on a payment plan initiated subsequent to the issuance of the SOR, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to decide that the evidence was insufficient 
for him to conclude that Applicant's efforts to repay or otherwise resolve the indebtedness had been made in "good-faith."</P> 
 
<P>Finally, the favorable record evidence cited by Applicant, including the fact that the security concerns arose as a result of a single, albeit large debt, is not 
sufficient to demonstrate the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  As the trier of fact, the Judge had to weigh the 
evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  Applicant's disagreement with the Judge's 
weighing of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  
There is ample record evidence to support the Judge's conclusion that it was too soon to tell whether Applicant had truly reformed his financial practices to the 
extent necessary to mitigate the Government's security concerns.</P>
