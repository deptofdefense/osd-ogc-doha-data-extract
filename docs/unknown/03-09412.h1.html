<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant was convicted of four counts of Indecent Behavior with a Juvenile in 1985, and sentenced to two and one-half years in jail on each count, with five 
years being suspended. He  served approximately two years in jail, was paroled in November 1987, and remained on probation until May 1990. Because of the 
statutory disqualification imposed by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, he is unable to mitigate the security concern his criminal conduct has created. Clearance is denied. I do 
not recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On October 23, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-09412.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline J for criminal conduct, and Guideline D for sexual behavior. The SOR also alleges that 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 
disqualifies Applicant from having a security clearance granted or renewed. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a sworn answer to the SOR dated November 13, 2003, admitted all SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. He also acknowledged his 
criminal conviction prohibited renewal of his security clearance because of the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 to his case, and requested his case be referred to 
the Secretary of Defense for consideration of a waiver.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">This case was assigned to me on April 26, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on May 20, 2004, scheduling the hearing for June 9, 2004. An amended notice 
of hearing was issued on June 3, 2004, changing the location where the hearing was to be held within the same city and on the same date and time as contained 
in the original notice of hearing. The hearing was conducted as scheduled.  The government submitted eight documentary exhibits at the hearing that were 
marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-8, and admitted into the record without an objection. Applicant testified at the hearing, called his work supervisor as a 
character witness, and submitted seven documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits 1-7, and admitted into the record without an objection. 
The transcript was received on June 18, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the testimony, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the 
following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 57 years old, has never been married, has no children, and, at the time of the hearing, was engaged to be married. He was awarded a Doctor of 
Philosophy degree in 1973, thereafter taught at the university level, and was an associate professor at a state university at the time of his arrest in 1984. 
Following his release from the penitentiary in 1987, he returned to college  as a student, and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science. He has 
been employed by defense contractors since at least September 1990, and is presently working as a senior software engineer.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was indicted on November 21, 1984, and charged with two counts of Indecent Behavior with a Juvenile and two counts of Pornography Involving 
Juveniles. The charges were based upon Applicant having sexually fondled two girls, ages seven and nine, on a number of occasions between March 1983 and 
June 1984. He also took sexually explicit photographs of the girls. His victim's were the daughters of his friends. Applicant's criminal conduct was discovered 
when the father of one of the victim's found naked pictures of his daughter while caring for Applicant's house. The police were notified, executed a search 
warrant for Applicant's house, and seized the photographs of the two victims and a large quantity of other child pornography.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant pled guilty and was convicted of four counts of Indecent Behavior with Juvenile on November 15, 1985. He was sentenced to two and one-half years 
in jail and fined $1,500.00 on each count. The sentence on two counts was suspended, and he was placed on five years probation on each of those counts, with 
those sentences ordered to run consecutively and to begin upon the completion of the two terms of imprisonment that were imposed. Applicant was paroled 
from prison on November 23, 1987, and his probationary sentence was terminated on May 18, 1990. He was granted a First Offender Pardon that became 
effective on July 15, 1990.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant voluntarily sought psychological counseling from a clinical psychologist in November 1984. He attributes his criminal conduct to the stresses present 
in his life that arose from a romantic relationship he was involved in with a woman. He continued with that counseling until he began serving his prison 
sentence, and resumed the counseling after his release from prison. The psychologist continues to see him on an informal basis at present, and believes 
Applicant is extremely unlikely to repeat this type criminal behavior. There is no evidence to indicate Applicant has any other criminal history.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's references have had the opportunity to observe him in work and social settings. They opine that he is an outstanding employee, a competent 
engineer, and an honest, dependable, and trustworthy individual. Applicant has held a secret security clearance since March 1993. There have been no 
allegations of mishandling classified material or reports of security violations made against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant testified he could not be blackmailed based upon his criminal history, because he has revealed his misdeeds to all family, social, and business 
acquaintances who might have any reason to know. His supervisor testified Applicant had told her about his criminal background, but she understood it 
involved middle-teenage girls, and did not believe it involved girls under the age of ten.            </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline J, 
pertaining to criminal conduct, and Guideline D, pertaining to sexual behavior, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-09412.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-09412.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence,<A HREF="03-09412.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="03-09412.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-09412.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-09412.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-09412.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-09412.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-09412.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="03-09412.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case against Applicant under Guideline J. The evidence establishes he was convicted of four counts of Indecent Behavior 
with a Juvenile, fined a total of $6,000.00, and sentenced to two and one-half years in jail on each count, although the sentence was suspended on two counts. 
He served approximately two years in jail before being paroled on November 23, 1987. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious crime or multiple 
lesser offenses</EM>; and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one 
year </EM>apply in this case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has no criminal history other than the convictions for sexually abusing and photographing the two girls who were his victims in the above noted case. 
He voluntarily sought psychological counseling, both before and after being sent to prison, and the prognosis is that he is extremely unlikely to re-offend. He 
returned to college following his release from prison and earned a degree in a field in which his criminal history would not create an automatic impediment. He 
has worked steadily in the defense industry as a software engineer for the past fourteen years, and has earned a reputation as an honest, dependable, and 
trustworthy employee and individual. He has possessed a security clearance since 1993, with no adverse reports having been made about his handling of 
classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>: The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">MC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>. . . the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur</EM> and MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is 
clear evidence of successful rehabilitation </EM> apply in this case. Although these mitigating conditions would otherwise be sufficient to mitigate Applicant's 
criminal conduct, the statutory disqualification imposed by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 mandates that he is unable to mitigate that conduct. Guideline J is decided against 
Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Sexual Conduct</SPAN>.  Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual 
to coercion, exploitation, or duress or reflects lack of judgment or discretion. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was convicted of sexual offenses committed against two tender age girls. That conduct was of a type that could have subjected him to coercion, 
exploitation, and duress, and, at a minimum, exhibited a serious lack of judgment and discretion. However, since his arrest, Applicant has received mental 
health counseling, the stressors he was previously unable to handle no longer appear to be present in his life, and there have been no reported relapses. His work 
record, the stability in his private life, and the psychologist's prognosis strongly indicate this type offense is unlikely to recur. Further, Applicant has revealed 
his criminal history to numerous people to prevent it from being a possible source of blackmail, although it does appear he has attempted to somewhat minimize 
the seriousness of the conduct.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Sexual behavior of a criminal nature  . . . </EM>; DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM>; and 4:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> 
Sexual behavior . . . which reflects lack of discretion or judgment</EM> apply in this case. MC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The behavior was not recent and there is no evidence of subsequent 
conduct of a similar nature</EM>; and 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is no other evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotional instability</EM> also apply. Under the 
circumstances present in this case, including the pre and post-conviction mental health treatment and excellent long-term work record, Appellant has mitigated 
the security concern caused by his sexual conduct. Guideline D is decided for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. Security clearance decisions are not intended to adjudge guilt or to impose 
further punishment for past transgressions. Rather, the objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a persons' 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their 
acts and omissions, including all criminal conduct, whether or not otherwise mitigated. I do not recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of the 
disqualification mandated by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. </SPAN></P>
