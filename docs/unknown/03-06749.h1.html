</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On May 19, 2004, under the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="03-06749.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="03-06749.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns 
raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the 
SOR in writing May 28, 2004</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and July 6, 2004.  He requested his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) on October 8, 2004.  The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 5.  By letter dated October 12, 2004, a copy of 
the FORM was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant did not 
submit additional information or objections within that time period.  On November 30, 2004, the case was assigned to me for a decision.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains seven allegations of disqualifying conduct.  Three allegations relate to conduct addressed under Guideline D, Sexual Behavior; three 
allegations relate to conduct addressed under Guideline E, Personal Conduct; and one allegation relates to conduct addressed under Guideline J, Criminal 
Conduct.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted allegations 1.a. and 1.c. under Guideline D. He denied allegation 1.b. under Guideline D.  He admitted 
allegations  2.a(1), 2.a(2), and 2.b. under Guideline E, and allegation 3.a. under Guideline J.  His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 47-year-old dispatcher employed by a defense contractor.  He was married in 1990 and divorced in 1992.  He married again in 2000.  His security 
clearance application (SF-86), which he signed and certified August 21, 2002, indicates he is the father of two children. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 1997, Applicant's employer (Employer A) issued him a letter of reprimand for  inappropriate behavior, including unsolicited and repeated flirtations, 
unwelcome and improper gestures, and other conduct that affected the work environment.  In January 2000, Applicant received a performance review from 
another employer (Employer B) advising him that he needed to improve his interpersonal relationships with coworkers and noting that he had been accused of 
sexual harassment, which, if substantiated, would be grounds for immediate termination.  He resigned his job with Employer B in January 2000.  In January 
2002, Applicant resigned from his job as assistant manager with Employer C, following allegations of sexual harassment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed and certified a security clearance application (SF-86) in August 2002.  Question 20 on the SF-86 reads as follows:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Your Employment Record</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Has any of the following happened to you in the past 7 years?</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">-Fired from job</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">-Quit a job after being told you'd be fired</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">-Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">-Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">-Left a job for other reason under unfavorable circumstances</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered "yes" to Question 20.  He stated further that he had left his job with Employer C for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances.  He 
identified the unfavorable circumstances as "no support from management," which did not accurately describe the circumstances of his resignation from his job 
with Employer C.  He did not list his resignation from Employer B or the circumstances which caused his resignation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 21, 2002,  Applicant signed and dated the following statement on his SF-86:    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"<STRONG>CERTIFICATION BY PERSON COMPLETING FORM</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">My statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.  I 
understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both.  (See section 1001 of Title 18, United 
States Code).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Security Service on December 6, 2002.  He told the agent he had been accused of sexual 
harassment while working for Employer C.   When Employer C offered him the choice of resignation or firing, he chose resignation. When asked by the special 
agent if he had any other disciplinary incidents in his employment background, Applicant replied he did not. (Item 5, at 1-2.)  In a second interview with the 
special agent in January 2003, Applicant admitted he was untruthful in his answers in the December 2002 interview about his employment background. (Item 5, 
at 1-2.)  He admitted receiving counseling for poor work performance from Employer B.  He admitted receiving a written warning from Employer A for 
inappropriate behavior, which included unsolicited and repeated flirtations and unwelcome and improper gestures.  He denied resigning in lieu of termination 
from any employment other than Employer C.  (Item 5, at 2.)  The record shows Applicant resigned his job at Employer B one week after receiving a written 
performance review alleging sexual harassment. (Item 5, at 5; 17-18.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 24, 2003, after participating in a second interview with the special agent, Applicant signed a written statement memorializing the substance of the 
interview.  The preamble to Applicant's statement reads:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I [Applicant] do hereby make the following voluntary statement to [special agent's name omitted], who has identified himself to me as a Special Agent of the 
Defense Security Service.  I make this statement without any threats having been made against me or any promises extended to me.  I certify that the following 
statement is true, complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief and is made in good  faith.  I understand that a knowing and willful false 
statement can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1001.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted giving the investigator false information. (Item  3, at 2,3.)</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline D - Sexual Behavior</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant received a letter of reprimand from Employer A for inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature, including unsolicited and 
repeated flirtations, and unwelcome and improper gestures (&para; 1.a.); that he resigned from Employer B in lieu of termination following allegations of sexual 
harassment (&para; 1.b.); and that he resigned from his job with Employer C following allegations of sexual harassment (&para;1.c.). Sexual behavior is a security concern 
if it involves a criminal offense (E2.A4.1.2.1.); is compulsive or addictive and indicates a personality or emotional disorder (E2.A4.1.2.2.); may subject the 
individual to coercion, exploitation, or duress (E2.A4.1.2.3.); or reflects lack of judgment or discretion (E2.A4.1.2.4.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's sexual behavior on the job was contrary to law and workplace conduct norms.  Despite disciplinary action from his employers for sexually 
harassing co-workers, Applicant persisted in the prohibited conduct, suggesting that it may be compulsive or addictive or may reflect a personality problem.  
His apparent inability or unwillingness to change or modify his conduct suggests a lack of judgment, and this, in turn, could make him vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or duress.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns arising from sexual behavior can be mitigated if the conduct occurred during or prior to adolescence and there is no evidence of subsequent 
similar conduct (Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A4.1.3.1.) or if the behavior was not recent and there is no evidence of subsequent similar conduct (MC 
E2.A4.1.3.2.)  Applicant's disqualifying conduct occurred not in adolescence but when he was 40 years of age and older.  His most recent episode of 
disqualifying conduct occurred in 2002, making it recent.  Thus, MC E2.A4.1.3.1. and MC E2.A4.1.3.2. do not apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two additional mitigating conditions might apply.  Applicant's disqualifying sexual conduct could be mitigated if, in his other conduct, he displayed no 
evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotional instability (MC E2.A4.1.3.3) or if the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, 
exploitation, or duress. (MC E2.A4.1.3.4.)  Applicant's disqualifying conduct under Guidelines E and J, discussed below, raises issues of questionable 
judgment and continuing vulnerability for coercion, exploitation, or duress.  Accordingly, MC E2.A4.1.3.3 and MC E2.A4.1.3.4 do not apply to the facts of 
Applicant's case, and the Guideline D allegations in the SOR are concluded against the Applicant.        </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant deliberately falsified his answers on his SF-86 to Question 20 (&para;&para; 2.a(1) and 2.a (2) and falsified material facts in a 
signed, sworn statement presented to an authorized investigator for the Department of Defense (&para; 2.b). While Applicant admits the falsifications and expresses 
remorse, his deliberate misrepresentations cause serious security concerns.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  
Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant's responsibility to provide truthful and complete responses to questions on his  SF-86 and to the questions of a lawful investigator cannot be 
waived, set aside, or ignored.  An applicant's employment history is material to a determination of his security worthiness.  With respect to the Guideline E 
conduct alleged in SOR subparagraphs 2.a(1), 2.a(2), and 2(b), Applicant falsified his SF-86 by omitting and concealing relevant and material information 
about his employment history in  response to Question 20, bringing his conduct under disqualifying condition E2.A5.1.2.2.  He did not make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts, and thus MC E2.A5.1.3.3. does not apply.  Moreover, he deliberately provided 
false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters on two separate occasions to an authorized investigator, bringing his conduct under 
disqualifying condition E2.A5.1.2.3. of Guideline E.  Applicant's falsifications were recent and not isolated incidents, and he did not supply the correct 
information voluntarily.  Thus MC E2.A5.1.3.2. does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's deliberate concealment of behavior that led to disciplinary actions by his employers increased his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress, 
and thus disqualifying condition E2.A5.1.2.4. applies. He has not taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or 
duress, and thus MC E2.A5.1.3.5. does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person's refusal to provide relevant and material information to the Government provides a rational basis for denial or revocation of access to classified 
information for that person.  ISCR Case No. 98-0445 at 3 (App. Bd. April 2, 1999), (quoting <EM>Gayer v. Schlesinger, </EM>490 F. 2d<EM> </EM>740, 754 (D.C. Cir. 1973); 
<EM>Clifford v. Shoultz</EM>, 413 F. 2d 868 (9<SUP>th</SUP> Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 396 U.S. 962 (1969)).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in the SOR, the Government has established its case.  Accordingly, the allegations in subparagraphs 2.a(1), 
2.a(2), and 2.b. of the SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant knowingly and willfully falsified his answers to Question 20 on his security clearance application in violation 18 U.S.C. 
&sect; 1001 and knowingly and willfully falsified material facts on a signed, sworn statement presented to a lawful investigator, also in violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 
1001.  DOHA further alleged these acts constituted felonious criminal conduct.  An applicant with a history or pattern of criminal behavior raises serious doubts 
about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent  statement or representation in any matter within the 
executive branch of the Government of the United States.  18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the 
Government of the United States.  <EM>See</EM> <EM>Egan,</EM> 484 U.S. at 527.  Applicant deliberately lied on the security clearance application he certified and signed for the 
purpose of obtaining a security clearance, and he lied about his employment record in two separate interviews with a special agent of the Defense Security 
Service.  An applicant's employment history is material to a determination of his security worthiness.  Applicant's answer to the SOR and his stated remorse for 
his conduct failed to convince me that he did not knowingly and willfully falsify his security clearance application and deliberately provide false information to 
a lawful investigator on his signed, sworn statement.  An applicant may be disqualified if allegations of criminal conduct are raised against him.  &para; 
E2.A10.1.2.1.  The criminal offense was not an isolated incident, and therefore mitigating condition E2.A10.1.3.2 does not apply.  After weighing the 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, the finding is against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
