  Misappropriation of $600 in small amounts over a 3-4 week period is not an "isolated incident."  Evidence that character references did not know about Applicant's 1994 misappropriation of $600 detracts from weight that reasonably  can be given to favorable statements made by character references.  Honesty and candor with government do not  immunize admitted misconduct from being considered for its security significance.  Favorable decision remanded with  instructions.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Administrative Judge Kathryn M. Braeman issued a decision, dated April 6, 1998, in which she concluded it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Department Counsel appealed. 
The Board remands the case to the Administrative Judge for further processing consistent with the rulings and instructions
set forth in this Decision and Order for Remand.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated
January 2, 1992, as amended.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Department Counsel's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that
Applicant did not try to steal money from an employer in 1996; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge's favorable
security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated October 14, 1997. 
The SOR was based on Criterion J (Criminal Conduct).  Department Counsel later moved to amend the SOR to include
the allegations that Applicant's conduct under Criterion J also fell under Criterion E (Personal Conduct).  Applicant did
not object to the motion to amend the SOR.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A hearing was held on March 11, 1998.  The Administrative Judge subsequently issued a written decision, dated April 6,
1998, in which she concluded it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The case is before the Board on Department Counsel's appeal from that favorable decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant did not try to steal money from an employer in 1996</U>. 
The Administrative Judge found Applicant did not try to steal $30.00 in 1996 from his then-employer.  Department
Counsel contends the Judge's find is not supported by the record evidence as a whole.  This contention is not persuasive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is conflicting evidence on the issue of whether Applicant tried to steal $30.00 from his then-employer in 1996. 
There is record evidence, which if found credible, would support a finding that Applicant did try to steal the money. 
There is record evidence, which if found credible, would support a finding that Applicant did not try to steal the money. 
The Administrative Judge weighed the record evidence and found Applicant did not try to steal that money.  The Board
does not have to agree with the Judge's finding to conclude it reflects a plausible, permissible interpretation of the
conflicting record evidence.  Department Counsel's ability to argue for an alternate interpretation of the record evidence is
insufficient to demonstrate the Judge's finding is erroneous.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0625 (August 17, 1998) at p. 3.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge's favorable security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</U>. 
The Administrative Judge found that in 1994 Applicant "kept $600 of [his then-employer's] money at home because he
resented the fact that he had been promoted, but not been given the raise he anticipated."  The Judge found Applicant's
conduct was "reprehensible," but concluded Applicant had mitigated his misconduct because: (a) Applicant's criminal
conduct was "isolated"; (b) Applicant repaid the money in 1994; (c) Applicant did not conceal his misconduct from the
government; (d) Applicant testified consistently at the hearing about his misconduct; (e) Applicant has matured and taken
positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate his vulnerability to coercion or exploitation; (f) Applicant has
demonstrated "a responsible work ethic for two years for his current employer"; (g) Applicant's coworkers and supervisors
"commend him"; (h) Applicant acknowledges his past misconduct, which occurred when he was younger; and (i)
Applicant is now married, has a child, and is "willing to take more responsibility on his job and in his life."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Department Counsel contends the Administrative Judge's favorable decision is arbitrary and capricious.  In support of this
contention, Department Counsel argues: (a) the Judge erred by characterizing Applicant's conduct as "isolated" and
applying Criminal Conduct Mitigating Guideline 2, but not applying Personal Conduct Disqualifying Guideline 5; (b) the
Judge erred by finding Applicant's 1994 theft to be "egregious" and then concluding that theft demonstrated merely
"questionable judgment"; (c) the Judge failed to give proper weight to the security significance of Applicant's abuse of his
obligations toward his then-employer; (d) the Judge gave undue weight to the evidence of Applicant's marriage and
parenting; (e) the Judge gave undue weight to the character references submitted on Applicant's behalf; (f) there is no
"clear evidence of rehabilitation" within the meaning of Criminal Conduct Mitigating Guideline 5; (g) the Judge gave
undue weight to her favorable assessment of Applicant's credibility; (h) there is no basis in the record to support the
Judge's application of Personal Conduct Mitigating Guideline 5; and (i) the Judge gave undue weight to the fact that
Applicant disclosed his past problems to the government.  For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes Department
Counsel has demonstrated the Judge committed harmful error.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The record evidence does not support the Administrative Judge's characterization of Applicant's 1994 misconduct as being
"isolated."  Applicant misappropriated money from his then-employer in small amounts over a 3-4 week period, for a total
of $600.  Such a course of misconduct -- involving multiple, separate acts of misappropriation over a period of several
weeks -- cannot fairly be characterized as "an isolated incident" within the meaning of Criminal Conduct Mitigating
Guideline 2.  The record evidence does not support the Judge's reliance on that mitigating guideline.  Nor does the record
evidence allow for a conclusion, under Section F.3. of the Directive, that Applicant's 1994 misconduct was isolated or
aberrational in nature.  Furthermore, given the evidence that Applicant engaged in a series of misappropriations over a
period of 3-4 weeks, not merely a single act of misappropriation, the Judge acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by
not applying Personal Conduct Disqualifying Guideline 5.<A HREF="97-0676.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge was somewhat inconsistent in her conclusions about the seriousness of Applicant's 1994
misconduct.  The Judge referred to that misconduct as "egregious" (Decision at p. 6), as showing "questionable judgment"
(Decision at p. 7), and as "reprehensible" (Decision at p. 8).  Given the record evidence of Applicant's pattern of deliberate
misappropriation of his employer's money over a period of 3-4 weeks in 1994, it was not reasonable for the Judge to
characterize Applicant's misconduct as demonstrating merely "questionable judgment."  Applicant's conduct in 1994
involved a pattern of deliberate dishonesty and criminal conduct when he knew or should have known that his misconduct
was serious, improper and without justification.  Furthermore, it demonstrated his willingness to breach his obligations to
his then-employer because of anger and resentment over his belief that he had been wrongfully denied a raise.  Such a
deliberate breach of the trust reposed in Applicant by his then-employer raises serious questions about Applicant's
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness, not merely indicate "questionable judgment."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge did not err in taking into account evidence of Applicant's conduct after the 1994 misconduct,
including evidence about his marriage and parenting.  Consideration of such evidence is permissible under Section F.3. of
the Directive and the requirement that a security clearance decision must be based on the "whole person" concept. 
Reading the Judge's decision in its entirety, the Board cannot conclude the Judge gave undue or decisive weight to the
evidence about Applicant's marriage and parenting.  Absent a showing of arbitrary and capricious action by the Judge, the
Board will not disturb a Judge's weighing of the evidence.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0289 (January 22, 1998) at p. 6.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge gave undue weight to the character references submitted on Applicant's behalf.  Although those
character references were admitted without objection by Department Counsel, the Judge was obligated to weigh that
evidence and make a reasoned decision about what weight could be given to that evidence.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0727 (August 3, 1998) at p. 4 n.1.  At the hearing, when questioned, Applicant admitted that the character references did
not know about his 1994 misconduct (Hearing Transcript at pp.55-57).  Those admissions detract from the weight that
reasonably can be given to the favorable statements made by the character references about Applicant's values, reliability,
and trustworthiness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The record evidence as a whole does not support the Administrative Judge's application of Criminal Conduct Mitigating
Guideline 5.<A HREF="97-0676.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  Although Applicant claimed he took the employer's money in 1994 without intending to steal it and
claimed he did not spend it, he never returned the money to the employer.  Although Applicant said he repaid the $600 he
misappropriated (Government Exhibit 2), he testified that he did not return the money he took home, but rather his then-employer kept his last pay check (Hearing Transcript at pp. 48-49).  Clearly, Applicant's hearing testimony is not
consistent with his earlier claim that he repaid the misappropriated money.  Indeed, the record evidence does not support
the Judge's finding that Applicant repaid the employer for the $600 he misappropriated.<A HREF="97-0676.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>  Furthermore, if Applicant really
did not intend to steal the money, and if he really kept it at home separate from his personal funds, then why did he keep
the $600 and not return it to its rightful owner?  And since Applicant did not return the money to its rightful owner, it
strains credulity for Applicant to claim he did not spend it.  Acceptance of Applicant's explanation would require
acceptance of the inference that Applicant still has the misappropriated $600 in his possession.  Absent a sustainable
finding that Applicant made restitution of the money he misappropriated in 1994, the Judge did not have a rational basis
to find Applicant demonstrated "clear evidence of rehabilitation."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge gave undue weight to the evidence that Applicant disclosed his past problems to the
government.  Honesty and candor with the government do not immunize admitted misconduct from being considered for
its security significance.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0176 (January 22, 1998) at p. 2.  Applicant's 1994 misconduct is
not extenuated or mitigated by the fact that he admitted it to the government.  However, Applicant's disclosure of his past
problems to the government provides <EM>some</EM> support for the Judge's reliance on Personal Conduct Mitigating Guideline 5.<A HREF="97-0676.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> 
Therefore, the Board does not find persuasive Department Counsel's contention that there is no basis for the Judge to
apply Personal Conduct Mitigating Guideline 5.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Taken in their totality, the errors identified in this decision undercut the Administrative Judge's favorable conclusions
about Applicant and her overall favorable security clearance decision.  Given the totality of the Judge's errors, the Board
cannot conclude they are harmless.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Department Counsel has met its burden on appeal of demonstrating error that warrants remand.  Pursuant to Item 33.b. of
the Additional Procedural Guidance, the Board remands the case to the Administrative Judge.  After correction of the
errors identified in this decision, the Judge must issue a new decision consistent with the requirements of Items 35 and 25
of the Additional Procedural Guidance.</FONT></P>
