<P>Deliberately and deceptively charging personal purchases twice from a wholesaler to the account of a former employer, using a false name, was classified as

</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 17, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  In a written statement, 
dated September 26, 2001, and notarized on September 29, 2001, the Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR and elected to have his case 
decided on a written record, in lieu of a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant received a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) on October 16, 2001, and received an opportunity to file objections and submit 
material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  The Applicant elected not to respond to the FORM within the requisite 30 days, <EM>i.e.</EM>, on or before November 
15, 2001..  The record in this case closed on November 15, 2001.  The undersigned Administrative Judge received the case assignment on December 19, 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on the following two guidelines: paragraph 1, Guideline E (personal conduct), and 
paragraph 3, Guideline J (criminal conduct).  The undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the record, and upon 
due consideration of the same, makes the following Findings of Fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is a 59-year-old assistant systems administrator employed by a U.S. Government contractor since March 27, 2000.  The Applicant seeks to obtain 
a personnel security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was born abroad and naturalized at age 19 in July 1961.  He served in the U.S. Navy from 1961 to 1964 and was discharged as an E-4.  A year 
later he married a U.S.-naturalized woman; the couple has two children, ages 35 and 31.  Shortly after his marriage the Applicant began 27 years of service as a 
U.S. postal employee.  After his voluntary retirement from the postal service in 1992, he had a series of jobs, each lasting 21 months or less.  He then got a job 
with Company #1 in November 1997 working in the area of cabling and personal computer support.  Because of a job disagreement, he gave his employer two 
weeks' notice and left that job at the end of April 1999.  The Applicant then was employed in two successive jobs in November 1999 through the first week of 
January 2000.  After a period of unemployment lasting less than three months, he was hired by his present employer on March 27, 2000.  FORM items 4 and 5.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">About the first week of March 2000, and before he was hired by his present employer, the Applicant entered a wholesale computer supply store and purchased 
some network support items.  He was wearing a shirt with the name of Company #1 on it and charged his purchases to that company's account with the 
wholesale computer supply store using a false name.  On March 24, 2000, the Applicant again purchased some more network support items from the same store 
while wearing the same shirt, using the same false name, and charging them again to Company #1's account.  Three days later the Applicant was hired by his 
present employer.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 31, 2001, the Applicant entered the same wholesale computer supply store and attempted to purchase more network support items using the same 
<EM>modus operandi</EM>.  Because Company #1 had rejected the purchases made by the Applicant earlier that month, the employees of the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">wholesale computer supply 
store </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">stalled the Applicant and called the police.<A HREF="01-07134.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The police investigated the situation as a possible case of theft by fraud but no charges were made because the 
wholesale vendor was satisfied by the immediate cash payment of $983.87 by the Applicant for the items previously purchased by him.  FORM item 6.<A HREF="01-07134.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an individual's security 
eligibility.  The guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or revoke a clearance (Disqualifying Conditions or DC) 
and those that may be considered in determining whether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions or MC).  In 
evaluating this case, relevant adjudicative guidelines as set forth below have been carefully considered as the most pertinent to the facts of this particular case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The guidelines, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating conditions most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>GUIDELINE E - PERSONAL CONDUCT</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">[5th] A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency; </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None applicable.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>GUIDELINE J - CRIMINAL CONDUCT</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. . . . criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged; </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None applicable.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive also requires the undersigned to consider, as appropriate, the factors enumerated in Section 6.3:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 to the Directive provides that the adjudicator should consider the following factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledge-able participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only upon an affirmative finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly consistent</SPAN> with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination required, the Administrative Judge may draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of 
record.  Determinations under the Directive include consideration of the risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly 
classified information as that term is defined and established under Executive Order 12958, effective on October 14, 1995.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme Court has said:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence standard without 
departing from the 'clearly consistent with the interests of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government to support the denial [of a security clearance] by a 
preponderance of the evidence would inevitably shift the emphasis and involve the Board in second-guessing the agency's national security determinations."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <EM>Dept. of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that Supreme Court guidance in its context to go to the minimum 
<STRONG><EM>quantum</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> of the admissible evidence that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its case, that is, substantial evidence but something 
less than a preponderance of the evidence--rather than as an indication of the Court's tolerance for error below.<A HREF="01-07134.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his or her security eligibility through evidence of 
refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case or through evidence of affirmative defenses.  Assuming the Government's case is not refuted, and 
further assuming it can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an applicant might deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified 
information, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he or she is nonetheless eligible to hold a security clearance.<A HREF="01-07134.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, the undersigned concludes that the Government established its 
case with regard to Guidelines E and J.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admits the facts alleged in SOR &para; 1.a., merely correcting the alleged date when the police were called to the wholesale computer supply store, 
and accepts the consequences of his actions.  He claims that the March 2000 "incident" is not representative of his normal conduct.  He denies, however, that he 
has a history of criminal activity and asks that "the one regrettable incident" not be viewed as a "pattern" of criminal activity.  FORM item 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence shows that the Applicant twice charged his purchases by deception to his former employer, not just once, and that he tried to do so a third time.  
That is a "history" of criminal conduct, and could be viewed as well as a pattern.  This falls within the scope of DC #a under Guideline J, which is identified on 
page 4 <EM>supra</EM>.  The Applicant admits that his conduct in March 2000 constituted "violations" of the state criminal code defining theft (FORM item 7).  That 
code classifies his actions as misdemeanors. These multiple lesser offenses fall within the scope of DC #b.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was able to escape prosecution for his actions by paying the wholesale price of the items he purchased although it is clear inference that, not 
being a current employee of Company #1, he was not entitled to such reduced prices.  His claim that he intended to call a particular employee of his former 
employer and reimburse the company is not given much weight since he allowed some three weeks to elapse without doing so--even though he claimed he was 
aware of the firm's billing cycle.  That he <STRONG><EM>deliberately </EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM>made those deceptive purchases is shown by not simply his wearing a Company #1 shirt but , more 
convincingly, his charging the purchases to a false name.  The Applicant was misusing the firm's creditworthiness rather than his own.  Those deceptive 
purchases constitute a pattern of dishonesty, falling within the scope of DC #5 under Guideline E, which is also identified on page 4 <EM>supra</EM>.  The Applicant has 
not submitted evidence that his actions in March 2000 were aberrational, nor did he submit corroboration of his claim that he has an impeccable work record 
with his present employer.<A HREF="01-07134.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Therefore, SOR &para; 1 (personal conduct) and SOR &para; 2 (criminal conduct) are concluded adversely to the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each clearance decision is required to take into consideration pertinent factors set forth in Section 6.3 of the Directive and in the adjudicative process discussion 
at enclosure 2 to the Directive.  These factors are identified on pages 4-5 <EM>supra</EM>.   The nature of the Applicant's conduct was serious.  Its recency, his 
motivation, and his age at the time all weigh against him.  The evidence does not support a prediction that the improper conduct will be unlikely to recur in the 
future.</SPAN></P>
