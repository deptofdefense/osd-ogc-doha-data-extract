<P>Applicant has a history of delinquent consumer debts he accrued while a student and immature about handling financial obligations. Having exhausted the 
funds given him by his father  on bad investments, gambling losses and an automobile sold to him under false pretenses, Applicant could not repay the incurred 
consumer debts while he was going to college and had no money to expend for non-living expenses and debts.   After initially indicating he would do nothing 
about his old debts which had been written off by the creditors, Applicant reversed course and paid off all of his delinquent debts and is committed now to 
maintaining current payment status with his all of his debts.  By his demonstrated good-faith payment efforts, Applicant mitigates security concerns associated 
with his delinquent debts.  Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 8, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on September 29, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on March 5, 2004, and was scheduled for 
hearing on April 7, 2004.  A hearing was convened on April 7, 2004, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on one 
witness (himself) and six exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on April 15, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to (a) have incurred five delinquent debts totaling in excess of $9,600.00, which he expressed no intention of paying, 
(b) have a personal financial statement of June 2002 which reports a $968.00 monthly remainder, but no intention to pay his old debts, and &copy;) have incurred his 
listed debts due to gambling losses (currently gambles twice a year).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations, denying a net monthly remainder of $968.00 and current gambling.  In explanation., he 
claimed the listed debts to be debts he incurred eight to nine years previous, which have since been written off by the creditors.  He reaffirmed his intention not 
to pay any of these debts.  He claimed the primary reasons for his incurring the listed debts was not gambling losses but (a) because $10,000.00 was stolen from 
him in the process of his attempting to purchase a car from a con artist and (b) due to a few bad investments.  He claimed he is not a person in personal distress, 
does not have a gambling addiction, and does not have any trouble paying his bills every month.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 29-year-old systems engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by 
Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In January 1995 Applicant's father created a college fund for Applicant with an up-front $50,000.00 contribution and encouraged Applicant to learn more about 
the stock market.  Ignoring his father's advice and dropping out of school shortly after receiving his father's contribution, Applicant invested the money in 
expensive vacations, an apartment with furnishings, entertainment, a luxury car, some risky investments, and gambling exercises while on vacation (<EM>see </EM>ex. B), 
losing virtually all of the money in the process.  Altogether, he lost $30,000 on bad stock investments, $10,000.00 in gambling, $10,000.00 from a car dealer 
who sold him a defective car, and $10,000.00 in vacationing (R.T.,at 47-49).  After losing this money, he began living off of the credit cards he had obtained in 
college.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant accumulated over $9,600.00 in credit card and other consumer-related debt between1994 and 1995 that he could not repay.  Some of this credit card 
debt was used to fund his gambling activities, along with other expenses (R.T., at 48-49).   Among these debts were the five consumer debts listed in the SOR.  
He attributes some blame for his debts to the credit card companies who offered him too much credit as a student (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Unable to keep up with his mounting debts and fast running out of money, Applicant moved back in with his parents in June 1995.  Despite letters from himself 
and his lawyer, he was never able to recoup any of his money from the car dealer who had mislead him.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant ceased paying on the listed five debts, and by 1996 they had been placed with collection agencies for enforcement.  Although aware of his 
responsibility for the debts, Applicant ignored the debts and even returned to gambling for a spell in 2001, albeit never to the point of addiction.  After 
obtaining his college degree in computer science in 2001, Applicant accepted employment with a series of employers in the software computer field.  He 
married in 1999 and bought a home.  With a mortgage and family to support, Applicant had no remainder left over to pay his old debts (R.T., at 41-42).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He 
currently makes around $59,000.00 a year.  His monthly expenses total around $3,500.00 a month (including his mortgage and payments on two cars), which 
leaves him with about $400.00 left over every month (R.T., at   54-55).  Applicant still gambles on occasion but never when he has money to lose, and never 
with friends.  He has incurred no gambling debts he is responsible for.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When asked by an interviewing DSS agent in June 2002 how he planned to address his old debts, he told the agent he had personally written off these debts, 
which had been charged off by the creditors years in 1996 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2, R.T., at 52-53).  Applicant blamed the debts on the creditors who assigned him too much 
credit.  He repeated his expressed intentions not to pay off any of his old debts when he answered the SOR a year later.  He has since paid off each of the listed 
creditors (<EM>i.e., </EM>creditors 1.a through 1.e) and currently lives within his means (<EM>see</EM> ex. D; R.T., at 64-66).  He acquiesced in leaving his debts in charged off 
status until he received the SOR and became concerned about losing his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Except for the listed debts he has since discharged, Applicant has and continues to be current with his debts, while living within his means with his wife and 
two children.  The debts reported in his most recent credit report reflect current payment status for every one of the listed debts (<EM>see</EM> ex.  E).  This includes his 
mortgage and other large debt items shown in his latest credit report.  His old debts that have since been paid are not shown in this credit report (<EM>compare</EM> exs. 3 
with E).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is highly regarded by his managers and team leaders (<EM>see</EM> ex. F).  He is credited with exemplary performance as a software engineer for his 
development team.  Applicant is characterized as honest, reliable and trustworthy in executing his responsibilities as a lead developer of portions of his 
company's workstation software.  He is respected for his flexibility and adaptability in his support of his company's software maintenance, integration and 
system testing and site support activities (ex. F).  Overall, he is viewed as an excellent performer by his company's management.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 5.  Financial problems that are linked to gambling, drug abuse, alcoholism, or other issues of security concern.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 6.  The individual initiated good-faith efforts to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding 
that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the 
evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and 
materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the 
evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant accrued considerable delinquent debt between 1995 and 1996 while a young college student who irresponsibly accrued credit-card and consumer debt 
with little thought as to how he would repay his debts.  Altogether, Applicant accumulated some $9,600.00 in credit-card and consumer debts over this two-year 
span, which were subsequently written off by his creditors as bad debts.  The Government's security concerns center on the amount of delinquent debt he 
compiled between 1995 and 1996 without any demonstrated repayment plan before the issuance of the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All of the debts Applicant compiled in 1995 and 1996 are consumer-related (mostly generated by credit cards) which Applicant accumulated in college with no 
realistic plan for repaying them.  Each of these debts became delinquent and were ultimately charged off by the creditors as uncollectible and reported as bad 
debts in Applicant's credit reports.  On this record, two of the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations apply: 
DC 1 (history of not meeting financial obligations) and DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).  DC 5 (financial problems that are linked to gambling, 
<EM>etc.</EM>) also bears some applicability; for Applicant is of record in using his credit card to finance his gambling back during the 1995-1996 timer period. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's debts are attributable mostly to his immaturity and failure to grasp the importance of prudent planning and investment in his financial future.  While 
he assigns part of the blame to the creditors that extended him credit in the knowledge he was a student with limited resources, the responsibility for accepting 
credit and running up large debit balances was always Applicant's.  He now acknowledges this responsibility as his own. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Extenuation of Applicant's debts is lacking.  Immaturity and squandering of the contribution given him by his father for investing are not sufficient reasons to 
extenuate his personal financial obligations fixed by the debt he accepted from the creditors who seek repayment from him.  Applicant acknowledges as much 
and has taken the necessary steps to discharge his debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Until recently, Applicant simply wrote off his old debts and relied on the absence of any enforcement action by any of his old creditors to afford him just reason 
for simply ignoring them.  Charge-offs and statute of limitations bars, however, have never provided mitigation sanctuaries for applicants seeking to avoid 
addressing their old debts.  While such devices might provide legal protection to an applicant seeking to avoid enforcement action, their availability does not 
meet the good-faith repayment demonstration test of MC 3 of the Guidelines for finances.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-32606 (January 2004); ISCR Case No. 01-09691 (March 2003).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Still, Applicant has since repaid all of his old debts and presents a clean credit report of creditors in current payment status.   Because the core concern of 
Guideline F is overextended debt that places the individual at risk to engaging in illegal acts to generate funds, and not just past actions that are covered by the 
disqualifying conditions, Applicant's shown payments of his listed debts and clean creditor report of his current finances enables him to mitigate active security 
concerns associated with his debt problems.   Now in current status, Applicant can be expected to continue to pay all of his incurred debts in a timely way. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Appraising Applicant's mitigation with respect to all of his covered debts,  Applicant may take advantage of  MC 6 (initiated good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors) based on his repayment efforts, but not MC 1 (behavior not recent), MC 2 (isolated incident) or MC 3 (circumstances beyond his control).  
Applicant's resistance to paying his old debts until recently represents continuing behavior and not simply behavior frozen in time when it occurred.  
Applicant's debt delinquencies were neither isolated nor beyond his control, either then or since he took his position with his current defense contractor.  
Nonetheless, he has paid all of his listed debts and now no longer is at any manifest risk to generate funds to pay his debts: the identified core concern of 
Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all of the circumstances of Applicant's accumulated debts and the good- faith efforts he demonstrated in satisfying his debts when he 
became able to so with his current income resources, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.a through 1.k as to the allegations governed 
by the Adjudicative Guidelines pertinent to Guideline F.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P>
