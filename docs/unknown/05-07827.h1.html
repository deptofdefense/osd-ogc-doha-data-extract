</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 31 March 2006 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of his clearance because of drug 
involvement, sexual behavior, criminal conduct, and personal conduct.<A HREF="05-07827.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He answered the SOR 21 April  2006, and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 20 June 2006, and I 
convened a hearing 15 August 2006. DOHA received the transcript 23 August 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied the SOR allegations. He is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a 28-year-old security officer employed by a defense contractor since April 2004. He previously held a clearance while in the U.S. Army from October 
1995 to December 2003. He received an honorable discharge from the Army.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant applied for a clearance in April 2004 (G.E. 1), he deliberately concealed his January 2002 arrest for indecent assault and rape (question 23e). He also allegedly concealed being 
charged with marijuana use in September 2001 (question 23d), and using marijuana during the same time frame (question 24). Applicant testified (Tr. 50-51) that he initially thought about reporting 
the January 2002 arrest, but decided against it because his commanding officer had told him not to worry about the charges and assured him there would be no record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In September 1991, Applicant was reported to have had a positive urinalysis for the metabolite of marijuana while stationed overseas (G.E. 2).<A HREF="05-07827.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> However, by the time the results became known, 
Applicant had transferred back to the U.S., so no action was taken by his overseas command (G.E. 3). Applicant testified that the first he knew of the alleged positive urinalysis was when the  
government provided discovery in this case in May 2006, and the government has produced no evidence that the allegations were ever adjudicated by Army authorities.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In January 2002, at his military post in the U.S., Applicant was arrested and spent much of the night in a holding cell on allegations of indecent assault and rape. The Army Criminal Investigation 
Command (CID) prepared a detailed report (G.E. 4) and gathered voluminous evidence--including a sworn statement by Applicant--none of which is included in the hearing record. The offense 
was eventually adjudicated at a company grade non-judicial punishment (Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice) during which Applicant was awarded a forfeiture of $780 pay for one month, 
14 days extra duty, and 14 days restriction.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Applicant testified that he did not remember receiving non-judicial punishment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's account of the incident is that he had consensual intercourse with a woman of his brief acquaintance in his barracks room on post. After she left his room, and left the post, she reported 
the alleged rape to local police, who referred the matter to military authorities. According to Applicant, the woman later apologized to him for falsely accusing him.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">both 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">fairly raised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense 
consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classif</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ied information. 
Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline H (Drug Involvem</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ent), </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline J

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The government must prove, by something less 
than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie </EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, 
extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring 
each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" 
standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="05-07827.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government failed to establish a Guideline H case.<A HREF="05-07827.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The military police report submitted by the government constitutes an allegation only--and an allegation is not proof. The police report 
contains insufficient evidence that had used marijuana or had tested positive for marijuana use. Further, the government's own evidence documents that the allegation was never adjudicated by the 
Army. Indeed, the government cannot prove that Applicant was even aware of the urinalysis results until it provided discovery to him in preparation for this case. I resolve Guideline H for 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline D. As with the drug allegation, the CID investigation constitutes an allegation only. Without any of the evidence 
ostensibly gathered during that investigation, there is no reason to discredit Applicant's claim that the intercourse was consensual. The adjudication of this charge undercuts the investigative report 
and bolsters Applicant's claim. It is highly improbable a case of actual indecent assault and rape would be adjudicated at a company-grade non-judicial punishment. That these charges were so 
adjudicated, and the minor punishment awarded, suggests that the convening authority viewed the crux of the matter as something no more egregious than having an unauthorized woman in the 
barracks. I resolve Guideline D for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline J. The government did not prove that Applicant ever used marijuana or tested positive for such use, and the  
punishment awarded Applicant at non-judicial punishment for the alleged indecent assault and rape indicates that the conduct being punished was so minor as to not raise security concerns.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. At the outset, since I concluded that the government did not prove 
that Applicant used marijuana or tested positive for marijuana use (or was even aware of the allegation), it follows that the government failed to prove that Applicant falsified his clearance 
application by failing to disclose his use of marijuana or his positive urinalysis. Accordingly, I find SOR 1.a. and 1.c. for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, notwithstanding the ultimate resolution of the alleged indecent assault and rape charges, I conclude that applicant deliberately concealed the charges and disposition from the 
government.<A HREF="05-07827.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN> First, he started to report the charges on his clearance application (under the section for felony charges) bu<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">t changed his mind. Second, in response to other questions asking about his  
criminal record, Applicant disclosed a 1999 non-judicial punishment for taking license plates off a vehicle while stationed overseas, and a 2004 speeding arrest. Finall</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">y, I do not find Applicant's 
claim that he did not remember receiving non-judicial punishment for the alleged sexual assault and rape credible. The key fact is that he knew he had faced allegations of indecent assault and rape 
and failed to disclose that to the government.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's conduct demonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared personnel. The government has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse information about an Applicant 
before making a clearance decision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information. Further, an applicant's willingness to report adverse information about 
himself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security violations or other security concerns in the future, something the government relies on in order to perform damage 
assessments and limit the compromise of classified information. Applicant's conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government interests. I resolve Guideline E 
against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
