<P>Applicant was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for residential burglary and unlawful restraint, and served two years and five months in prison. The 
provisions of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 require denial of his clearance. Clearance denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 29 November 2004 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or 
revocation of his clearance because of criminal conduct, alcohol consumption, and financial considerations.<A HREF="03-18799.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant answered the SOR on 17 January 2005 
and requested decision without hearing. He did not respond to DOHA's 12 August 2005 File of Relevant Material (FORM). The record closed 22 September 
2005, when the response was due. DOHA assigned the case to me 7 November 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR. He denied the allegations of paragraph 3.<A HREF="03-18799.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Accordingly, I incorporate these admissions as 
findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 51-year-old field technician for a defense contractor since October 2000--seeks access to classified information. He has not previously had a 
clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a 20-year history of criminal conduct demonstrated by nine arrests between August 1984 and February 2004.<A HREF="03-18799.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The most security significant of 
these arrests was a September 1984 arrest for aggravated kidnaping, kidnaping, residential burglary, and unlawful restraint arising out of a domestic dispute 
between Applicant and his estranged wife. He was convicted of residential burglary and unlawful restraint and sentenced to 10 years and 3 years respectively. 
His successful appeal resulted in reduction of his sentence to time served: two years and five months, thus triggering the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, Applicant had a February 2004 DUI charge (failure to submit)<A HREF="03-18799.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>, a July 2002 drunk in public charge (Applicant admitted having had too much to 
drink), a January 2001 DUI charge (.10 B.A.C.), a September 1999 resisting a peace officer charge (alcohol-related bar fight), and a January 1999 
battery/criminal damage to property charge.<A HREF="03-18799.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his August 2003 sworn statement and his answer to the SOR, Applicant minimized the significance of his arrests, even where the court dispositions or other 
documentation belie his version of events. He provided documentation of his good work performance and reputation in his current job. He asserts that he met 
all the conditions of his February 2004 DUI conviction, including counseling and AA participation, and claims that he has continued with AA to ensure that 
"the drinking incidences cease." However, he provided no corroboration of the claimed AA meetings or counseling.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline G (Alcohol 
Consumption), and Guideline F (Financial Considerations).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 amended Title 10 U.S. Code to add a new section, &sect; 986 [the 
Smith Amendment], precluding the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense (DoD) under four specific circumstances. 
On 7 June 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued implementing regulations under DoD 5200.2-R; the Director, DOHA issued Operating Instruction 64 
(O.I. 64) on 10 July 2001. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 9, 2004, Section 1062 of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 was approved 
and adopted, amending portions of &sect;986 of Title 10, United States Code, to provided, in pertinent part, that Applicants who are both sentenced to prison for 
more than one year and"incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than one year,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">" </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">may not be given a clearance. The amendments further provided that 
waivers "may be authorized only in accordance with standards and procedures prescribed by, or under the authority of, an Executive order or other guidance 
issued by the President."</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="03-18799.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a Guideline J case by demonstrating that Applicant was convicted of residential burglary and unlawful restraint, was sentenced to 
10 years imprisonment, and served two years and five months.<A HREF="03-18799.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> This criminal conduct cannot be mitigated under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. The statute requires that 
Applicant's clearance be denied because he served a over a year.<A HREF="03-18799.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> However, even without this requirement, I could not find Applicant's criminal conduct 
mitigated. Although this arrest occurred over 20 years ago, Applicant had five alcohol-related arrests between January 1999 and February 2004. None of the 
Guideline J mitigating factors apply. His conduct is recent,<A HREF="03-18799.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> not isolated,<A HREF="03-18799.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and there is little evidence of successful rehabilitation.<A HREF="03-18799.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Accordingly, I conclude 
Guideline J against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a Guideline G case and Applicant did not mitigate those concerns. Applicant's five alcohol-related incidents over five years<A HREF="03-18799.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> raise 
serious security concerns whether he has a problem with alcohol. He meets none of the mitigating factors for alcohol consumption. His alcohol incidents 
indicate a pattern of abuse.<A HREF="03-18799.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> His alcohol problem is recent.<A HREF="03-18799.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> Although he claims to have made changes in his personal life and learned important lessons from 
his alcohol counseling, he has provided neither corroboration nor details.<A HREF="03-18799.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> Consequently, his evidence falls short of meeting his burden of demonstrating that 
he does not have an alcohol problem. I conclude Guideline G against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government did not establish a Guideline F case. Applicant's answer to the SOR established that Applicant had resolved these accounts before the SOR 
was issued.</SPAN></P>
