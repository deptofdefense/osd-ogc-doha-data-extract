<P><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG><EM></EM>Applicant, a naturalized citizen of the US who has immediate family members who are citizens of Taiwan and reside there (save for Applicant's brother who 
resides in Australia), mitigates any potential risk to undue foreign influence concerns under Guideline B. Taiwan, while a country reported to gather economic 
and proprietary intelligence against the US and its companies, retains strong mutual strategic interests with the US and is a county with a history of democratic 
traditions and respect for human rights and the rule of law.   Clearance is granted.<STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 28, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on April 15, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was re-assigned to me on July 3, 2003, and was scheduled for hearing.  
A hearing was convened on August 21, 2003, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, 
deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of two exhibits; Applicant relied on thirteen witnesses (including 
himself) and five exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on September 2, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At hearing, the Government requested official notice be taken of the NACIC's Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial 
Espionage.  The Government also requested official notice be taken of the OPSEC Intelligence Threat Handbook for Taiwan, which covers economic 
intelligence activities of Taiwan and other named countries against the US.   For  good cause shown, official notice was taken of both the NACIC's Annual 
Report and OPSEC Intelligence handbook pursuant to Rule 201(b) of F.R.Evi.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant, in turn, asked that official notice be taken of the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96-8 96<SUP>th</SUP> Congress) of 1979, which authorizes the continuation 
of commercial, cultural, and other relations between the US and Taiwan.   Applicant also requested official notice be taken of the US State Department's 2001 
country report of Taiwan's economic policy and trade practices.  For  good cause shown, official notice was taken of both the Taiwan Relations Act and the 
State Department's 2001 country report of Taiwan  pursuant to Rule 201(b) of F.R.Evi.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 62-year old senior engineer for a defense contractor who seeks to retain his security clearance, which he has retained since 1984.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to have (a) a mother who is a citizen and resident of Taiwan (Republic of China), (b) two brothers who are citizens and 
residents of Taiwan and (c) a sister who is a Taiwan citizen who was born in the Peoples's Republic of China and resides in Taiwan.</P> 
 
<P>For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations of the SOR, but denies his mother and siblings are in any way subject to influence or 
pressure from the Taiwan Government or any other foreign entity.    He claims his relatives have never expressed any interest in the details of any of his 
professional activities.  Should they, he claims he would report the contact immediately to the appropriate security authorities as required by US regulations.     </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Relevant and Material Findings</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">            The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  
Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Applicant's background</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Born and raised in Taiwan, Applicant served a year plus in the Taiwan military before immigrating  to the US in 1966 on a student visa to attend college.   
While doing his graduate studies in the US, he became an academic instructor.  In this role, he  met his future spouse (W).  Instead of returning to Taiwan after 
finishing his studies, he and W married and established permanent residence in the US.   Together, they have reared two children (a son, aged 19 and a 
daughter, aged 20) as US citizens who are currently enrolled in a respected university in their home state (with their son a national merit scholar). Applicant 
earned his PhD degree in nuclear physics; while W earned hers in musical arts, both from prestigious American universities.  Applicant became a naturalized 
US citizen in July 1983 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 1;  R.T., at 61) and does not claim dual citizenship with Taiwan.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been with his current defense contractor (successor by merger to his previous employer) since 1984.  He provides analysis on missile target data 
on a company missile project for DoD.  He is credited with developing means for perfecting targeting and timing requirements.  In his design work, he takes 
advantage of both classified and unclassified  information.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">W has been to Taiwan twice: once in 1981 to meet Applicant's parents, and  a second time in 1994, accompanied by Applicant and their children.  She 
maintains regular contact with her own family members living in Taiwan, but less frequent casual contacts with Applicant's sister and brothers in the same 
country: no more than every three or four months.  Sometimes W gets letters from old Taiwanese classmates.  None of W's family members residing in Taiwan 
work, or are affiliated, with the Taiwan Government: Her father is an interpreter and taught school for a number of years before becoming the president of a 
Baptist seminary in Taiwan.  In Applicant's view, none of his own immediate family members, or W's family members, residing in Taiwan are in any danger of 
being subjected to undue influence to elicit classified economic or proprietary data.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant currently has two brothers (one a high school teacher, age 60, and another in sales, age 55) and one sister (en elementary school teacher, age 63) 
residing in Taiwan.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has no property or financial interests in Taiwan.  He maintains regular weekly contact with his mother and brothers by telephone.  He has traveled to 
Taiwan on four occasions since 1966 to visit his immediate family.  His last Taiwan visit was in 2000 to see his mother following  her accident (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2).  He 
does not provide financial assistance to his mother or any of his siblings, who own their own property and require no assistance.  While he has applied to the US 
State Department for permits to bring both his mother and siblings to the US, each has declined for different reasons: his mother for health reasons and his 
siblings for economic and family reasons.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is very active with his local church, the membership of which is mostly of ethnic Chinese descent.  He is highly regarded by other members of his 
church as a member who  provides considerable support to his church's upkeep and activities (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 140-42).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is highly regarded by his management, supervisors and colleagues at work who value him as an integral contributor to their company's identified 
missile project for DoD and a very careful and capable engineer responsible for developing the means for determining optimum  missile launching sequences.  
All of his managers, supervisors and colleagues recognize the extreme difficulty in finding technical talent like Applicant to develop and test design formulas 
for the missile project (<EM>see </EM>exs. A through E; R.T., at 85-87, 91-93, 97-101, 104-05, 108-14, 117-22, 125-27, 130-33, 136-38).   Others who know Applicant 
through his local church  speak highly of him as a person who is hardworking, dedicated to helping others in his church, and a solid US citizen.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Taiwan's political and economic state</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taiwan is a constitutionally created democracy with a sophisticated legal system whose core norms reflect a biding respect for human rights and the rule of law.  
Its recently confirmed structural policies embrace privatization, floating exchange rates, investment barriers in certain industries, and high tariffs and pricing 
structures on some goods, to better facilitate exploitation of the country's foreign trade advantages.  Taiwan is a beneficiary of the US' Taiwan Relations Act of 
1979.  Declared US policy of the Act is, <EM>inter alia, </EM>to help maintain, peace, security and stability in the Western Pacific; to consider any effort to determine the 
future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave 
concern to the US; to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character; and to maintain the capacity of the US to resist any resort to force or other forms of 
coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system of the people of Taiwan.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Intelligence Threat handbook (OPSEC report published in April 1996) provides an in-depth analysis of economic intelligence collection activities directed 
against the US.  In this report, Taiwan is listed as one of the countries that targets US companies for collection activities, fostered by the openness of American 
society and the huge investment of American industry in the development of advanced technology.  NACIC's annual report to Congress also lists Taiwan 
among its list of countries who are the most active collectors of economic intelligence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list "binding" policy considerations to be made by judges in the decision making process covering 
DOHA cases. The term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security 
clearance should be granted, continued, or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In 
addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 
E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in  reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Concern: </EM>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including co-habitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or are obligation <EM>are not</EM> citizens of the United States <EM>or may </EM>be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1: An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a 
foreign country.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1: A determination that the immediate family members, co-habitant or associate  are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a 
foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical 
basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of potential risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for 
the purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant immigrated to the US in 1966 on a student visa, and in 1983 became a naturalized US citizen. Both he and W (also a naturalized US citizen) received 
their advanced education in the US, raised children as natural born US citizens and are highly regarded in their chosen fields in the US.  Each, though, has 
immediate family members in Taiwan, with whom they maintain regular, if not casual, contact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Government urges security concerns over risks that Applicant's parents and siblings (citizens and residents of Taiwan) might be subject to undue foreign 
influence by Taiwanese authorities to access classified information in Applicant's possession or control.  Because Applicant's mother and siblings reside in 
Taiwan, they present potential security risks covered by disqualifying condition 1 (DC 1) of the Adjudication Guidelines for foreign influence.  The 
citizenship/residence status of these relatives in Taiwan pose some potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks of undue foreign influence that could 
compromise classified information under Applicant's possession and/or control. </P> 
 
<P>From what is known from Applicant's own statement and testimony, none of Applicant's immediate family residing in Taiwan have any financial or political 
affiliations with Taiwan's government, have any history to date of being subjected to any coercion or influence, or appear to be vulnerable to the same.  Taking 
Applicant's explanations about his immediate family at face value, any risk of undue foreign influence on Applicant and/or his immediate family would appear 
to be insubstantial and clearly manageable.  Taiwan, although a country reported to have targeted US economic and proprietary interests in the past, enjoys a 
special protective relationship with the US through the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 and is a democratic government with a history of respect for human rights 
and the rule of law. </P> 
 
<P>The Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate <EM>per se</EM> results or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are 
citizens/residents of foreign countries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country may not be in another.  While foreign 
influence cases must by practical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing in the supplied materials and country 
information about Taiwan  available under the Adjudication Desk reference (as here). </P> 
 
<P>The special relationship that has existed between the US and Taiwan over the past half-century been one marked by mutually reconcilable political and 
economic interests.   Reports of Taiwan intelligence gathering against US companies are counterbalanced by Taiwan's history of friendship and partnership in a 
defense pact formalized in 1979.  The mutually supportive bonds that have linked Taiwan's special relationship with the US have not been weakened by either 
the Taiwan Relations Act, or the  geopolitical forces that have shaped the US's evolving relationship with the People's Republic.  Whatever potential security 
risks arise as the result of Applicant's having immediate family with citizenship and residency in Taiwan are by every reasonable measure mitigated.  </P> 
 
<P>Taiwan remains a friend of the US and is a country whose democratic institutions are not incompatible with our own traditions and respect for human rights and 
the rule of law.  While the foreign influence provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines are ostensibly neutral as to the nature of the subject country, they should 
not be construed to ignore the geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign regime involved.  Taiwan, while reported to target the US and its 
companies in the past for economic and proprietary information, is still a country with no known recent history of hostage taking or disposition for exerting 
undue influence against family members to obtain either classified information, or unclassified economic and proprietary data. </P> 
 
<P>As for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant's immediate and extended family members in Taiwan  (a country whose interests have 
recently been and continue to be friendly to those of the US), any potential risk of a hostage situation or undue foreign influence brought in the hopes of 
eliciting either classified information or economic or proprietary data out of Applicant becomes an acceptable one.  Mitigation benefits set forth in MC 1 
(presence of immediate family in host country poses no unacceptable security risk) of the Adjudicative Guidelines are fully available to Applicant.  Overall, any 
potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's family members in Taiwan are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive judgments about 
Applicant's ability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to his familial relationships in Taiwan.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the 
allegations covered by Guideline B.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E.2.2 of the 
Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.</SPAN></P>
