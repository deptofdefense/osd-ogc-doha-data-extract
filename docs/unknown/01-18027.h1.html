<P>Applicant abused marijuana from 1969 to October 2000, and he drank beer on a regular basis when playing billiards with friends.  An arrest for drunk driving 
and possession of marijuana in 1993 had no impact on his behavior.  He deliberately did not disclose his arrest record or his illegal drug use on a January 1999 
security clearance application as he feared loss of his employment.  Following his arrest for drunk driving and illegal drug possession in October 2000, 
Applicant ceased his drug use and moderated his alcohol consumption.  With the insight gained from his participation in a driver alcohol education program in 
2001, Applicant is not likely to relapse into substance abuse.  Concerns persist for his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness because of his lack of candor, 
and exhibited tendency to act in self-interest.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated December 
10, 2001, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct 
proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.  The SOR was based on excessive alcohol consumption 
(guideline G) with drunk driving incidents; illegal drug involvement (guideline H) with alleged marijuana use from 1969 to October 2000; and personal conduct 
(guideline E) and criminal conduct (guideline J) related to deliberate falsification of a January 1999 security clearance application.</P> 
<P>On February 1, 2002, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and by letter dated March 15, 2002, he requested a hearing before a DOHA 
Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to me accordingly on May 1, 2002.  Pursuant to formal notice dated May 8, 2002, the hearing was scheduled for 
ay 29, 2002.  At the hearing, which was held as scheduled, the Government submitted five documentary exhibits, which were entered without any objection.  
Applicant's case consisted of his testimony and a record of his completion of a driver alcohol education program.  (Ex. A).  With the receipt on June 7, 2002, of 
the transcript of the hearing, this case is ripe for a decision.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>After a thorough review of the evidence, and on due consideration of the same, I render the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 50-year-old facility operator (utility maintenance worker) with a history of illicit marijuana abuse from 1969 to October 2000.  He has been 
employed by a defense contractor since May 1974 and was subsequently granted a Confidential security clearance for his duties.<A HREF="01-18027.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  He seeks to retain that level 
of access.</P> 
<P>Circa 1967, when he was fifteen or sixteen years of age, Applicant began to drink beer once every few weeks when socializing with friends.  His consumption 
was limited as he did not have the money to buy alcohol.  After Applicant tried marijuana in 1969, his involvement with alcohol was limited to occasional 
social settings when out with friends.  Circa the early 1980s, Applicant began to drink beer with friends while playing billiards at least once per month with 
friends at a men's social club.</P> 
<P>Marijuana quickly became Applicant's drug of choice, as he enjoyed its mellowing effects.  Applicant smoked marijuana on an almost daily basis from 1969 
until 1972 or 1973, purchasing a quarter to half ounce bag once every two weeks.  While Applicant bought the drug primarily for personal consumption, he also 
shared some of his marijuana with friends.  Applicant limited his involvement with marijuana to weekends after he commenced work for the defense contractor, 
and it became more sporadic with the passage of time.  Aware of the illegality of marijuana use, Applicant continued to smoke the drug as he did not feel he 
was harming anyone by doing so.  Following his marriage in early 1991, Applicant used marijuana with his spouse primarily at his residence, although 
occasionally he used it with friends as well.</P> 
<P>After drinking three to six beers at the club while playing billiards with friends on an occasion in mid-March 1993, Applicant en route home was stopped by an 
officer on routine patrol for defective equipment (headlight out on his vehicle).  Detecting an odor of alcohol about Applicant as he spoke with him, the officer 
informed Applicant he would need to submit to a battery of field sobriety tests before he would be permitted to continue home.  Based on his observations, the 
officer  was of the opinion Applicant had consumed too much alcohol to safely operate a vehicle.  He arrested Applicant for operating under the influence of 
liquor (OUIL) and defective equipment.  During a search of Applicant's vehicle incident to the arrest, the police found a marijuana cigarette.  A charge of 
possession of class D substance (marijuana) was added.  At the time of booking, Applicant's blood alcohol content tested at .08% and .09%.  Applicant pleaded 
not guilty to the charges in court.  He was found not guilty of the OUIL.  The possession of marijuana offense was continued without a finding.</P> 
<P>   Following his arrest, Applicant continued to drink alcohol and to smoke marijuana.  Over the next seven years, from 1993 to October 2000, Applicant used 
marijuana recreationally, at a frequency which varied from once every two months to four or five times in a month.  Approximately once every six months, 
Applicant purchased quarter to half ounce bags of marijuana for $45.00.  He consumed alcohol in quantity of once or two beers at the men's social club on 
Wednesdays, and on occasional Friday or Saturday nights.  On occasion, he imbibed hard liquor at home with his spouse.</P> 
<P>  In late January 1999, when Applicant's employer was undergoing some downsizing- laying off some employees and closing some manufacturing plants due to 
recent acquisitions-Applicant was asked to complete a security clearance application (SF 86), EPSQ version.<A HREF="01-18027.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  With the understanding he was being asked to 
submit the form to maintain his existing Confidential security clearance, and aware that a knowing and willful false statement on the form could be punished by 
a fine or imprisonment or both, Applicant answered "NO" to inquiries related to any alcohol and drug abuse, including question 24 ["Have you ever been 
charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?  For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been 
'sealed' or otherwise stricken from the record.  The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act 
for which the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607."]; question 27 ["Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 
years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, 
morphine, codeine, heroine, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription 
drugs?"]and question 28 ["Have you EVER illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor or courtroom official; 
while possessing a security clearance; or while in a position directly and immediately affecting public safety?"].  Applicant did not report his 1993 OUIL arrest 
in response to question 24 as he thought disclosure was not required since he had been found not guilty.  Fearing the potential loss of his job should he reveal 
his illegal drug use, Applicant deliberately concealed his involvement with marijuana, including his arrest for illegal possession in 1993.<A HREF="01-18027.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant was 
granted in Interim Confidential security clearance in March 1999.<A HREF="01-18027.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>After drinking six or seven beers while playing billiards at the club with friends in October 2000, Applicant was pulled over for crossing the yellow line.  After 
failing several field sobriety tests, he was arrested for OUIL (subsequent offense) and marked lane violation.  During an inventory search of Applicant's vehicle, 
three roaches of suspected burned marijuana cigarettes were found.  Applicant had purchased the marijuana for his own consumption.  A charge of illegal 
possession of a class D substance (marijuana) was added.  Following his arrest, Applicant resolved not to use any marijuana in the future as the arrest brought 
home to him that smoking the drug could result in serious criminal penalties.</P> 
<P>In early December 2001, Applicant appeared in court on charges of OUIL,  possession of a class D substance (marijuana) and marked lane violation.  Sufficient 
facts were found on the OUIL and illegal possession charges, and his case was case was continued to December 2001 without a guilty finding being entered on 
the condition he complete one year probation, attend and complete a driver alcohol education program, submit to random drug tests, and pay fines totaling 
$410.00 and program costs.  His driver's license was automatically suspended for 120 days due to refusal to take a breathalyser.</P> 
<P>A week after his December 2000 sentencing for the OUIL and illegal drug possession charges, Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense 
Security Service (DSS) about his alcohol and drug involvement, including his arrests in March 1993 and October 2000.  Applicant acknowledged his arrest in 
arch 1993 for OUIL, possession of class D substance and defective equipment, but attributed his inadequacy during  field sobriety tests to legs tired from 
shoveling and to wearing oversized rubber boots when the tests were performed.  Applicant told the agent he was found not guilty by a judge on all counts.  
Regarding his recent arrest, Applicant indicated he had been placed on one year probation, which was scheduled to begin in January 2001, and to complete a 
26-week alcohol education program.  Applicant admitted he had imbibed  "too many beers" to safely drive on the occasion of his recent arrest.  He denied 
smoking any marijuana on that occasion, but acknowledged the police had found marijuana in his vehicle which he had purchased for his own consumption.  
Applicant detailed his use of marijuana from 1969 to the week prior to his arrest in October 2000 and expressed his resolve, as well as that of his spouse, to 
abstain from marijuana use in the future.  Applicant told the agent he had intentionally omitted his use and purchase of illegal drugs from his security clearance 
application because he did not want it to interfere with him retaining his security clearance, and he expressed regret at his decision to initially withhold the 
information.  Applicant also detailed his alcohol use, including his pattern for the previous seven years of drinking beer at the club on Wednesday nights and on 
occasional Fridays and Saturdays.  Applicant related no change to his drinking habits as he did not have a drinking problem or a history of drunkenness.  
Applicant advised his coworkers were aware of his recent OUIL, but he had not informed them of the drug possession charge.  Applicant expressed his intent to 
remain a member at the club but promised not to drink more than one or two beers before driving home.  Concerning his failure to list his 1993 arrest on his SF 
86, Applicant maintained he was "very surprised" to learn he had not disclosed it on the form.  He denied any intentional concealment regarding his arrest 
history or use of alcohol.</P> 
<P>From late December 2000 to late August 2001, Applicant attended a driver alcohol education program consisting of an intake evaluation, sixteen group 
sessions, a Mother's Against Drunk Driving (MADD) forum meeting, and two self-help meetings.  Applicant was an active participant in sessions, and he 
gained significant insight into the issues of controlled substance and alcohol abuse.  On his successful completion of the program, no further treatment was 
recommended.</P> 
<P>As of late May 2002, Applicant was drinking once per month in quantity of four or five beers when playing billiards with friends at the men's club.  Applicant 
no longer drives after drinking in that amount.  Approximately once per week, Applicant was also imbibing a couple of beers when grilling food.  Applicant 
intends to continue this pattern of consumption in the future.  Not offered any marijuana nor in the presence of anyone using marijuana since October 2000, 
Applicant had managed to remain abstinent from illegal drugs since his last arrest.</P>

</P> 
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination  required.  
Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other 
pertinent behavioral changes; the potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in 
the future.  <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.  Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it 
should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse 
information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information 
reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">See</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section

an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination 
required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  In 
addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.  Decisions under the Directive include 
consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN><STRONG></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden and 
establishes conduct cognizable as a security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, 
extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  Any doubt as to whether access 
to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security.  <EM>See</EM> Enclosure 2 to the Directive, Section 
E2.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to guidelines G, H, E and 
J:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to guideline G, alcohol consumption, Applicant allowed alcohol to negatively impact his judgment and reliability on at least two occasions.  When 
he was pulled over for defective equipment in March 1993, the officer observed signs of possible alcohol abuse sufficient to administer field sobriety tests.  
With blood alcohol results of .08% and .09% at the time of booking, Applicant was found not guilty of drunk driving.  Given his blood alcohol level was almost 
over the legal limit when tested sometime after he was taken to the police department, Applicant may well have been legally drunk when he was operating his 
motor vehicle, although based on this record, it cannot be determined for certain that he was legally intoxicated.  Clearly, his behavior was impaired to some 
degree by alcohol.  Of the October 2000 incident, Applicant admits he had too much to drink to safely drive, and indeed, sufficient facts were found to support 
the OUIL charge.  On both of the occasions, Applicant was stopped en route home after drinking with friends while playing billiards at a men's social club.  
Although Applicant was not a habitual drinker to excess, he had established a routine which presented a real risk of future similar incidents if left unchecked.  
As of December 2000, he was drinking four to five beers at the social club on Wednesday nights.  Under the adjudicative guideline pertinent to alcohol 
consumption, disqualifying condition E2.A7.1.2.1. must be considered in evaluating Applicant's current security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To Applicant's credit, the October 2000 OUIL offense served as a wake-up call, as he realized he had to change his behavior.  Required to complete a driver 
alcohol education program for the October 2000 OUIL offense, Applicant went into the program with a positive attitude.  A very active participant in group 
therapy, he attended all sessions, including a MADD forum and two self-help meetings. In the opinion of his counselor, Applicant gained "significant insight" 
into the issues of substance abuse, and no further treatment was recommended.  While Applicant continues to drink as much as four or five beers while playing 
billiards with his friends, he has reduced the frequency of these outings to once per month, and he no longer drives after drinking.  In light of these positive 
changes in behavior supportive of sobriety (<EM>See</EM> mitigating condition E2.A7.1.3.3.), a favorable outcome is warranted with respect to subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b. 
of the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When arrested for drunk driving in March 1993 and October 2000, Applicant was found to be in possession of marijuana.  Applicant admitted in December 
2000 to the DSS agent that marijuana was his drug of choice, and his thirty-two years of recreational involvement confirms that.  A daily user of marijuana from 
1969 to 1972/73, Applicant continued to smoke marijuana on weekends after he started working for his defense contractor employer.  After his marriage in 
1991, he used marijuana with his spouse.  As he aged, his use of marijuana became more sporadic, but it continued to be part of his recreational lifestyle.  
Although there is no evidence he used marijuana on the day of his arrest in October 2000, he was in possession of marijuana which he had purchased for his 
personal consumption.  Clearly, neither his defense-related employment nor the laws against such involvement deterred him from activity which he found 
personally pleasurable.  Moreover, Applicant's illegal drug use has security implications which go beyond the issue of drug-related mental and/or physical 
impairment which could negatively impact his ability to safeguard classified information.  Fearing disclosure of his illegal drug use could cost him his clearance 
and/or defense-related job, Applicant falsely denied any drug use when he completed his SF 86 in January 1999.  Applicant may not have been aware of the 
Department of Defense's zero tolerance policy regarding illicit drug use, but he recognized his employer and the Government would not look favorably on his 
off-duty marijuana use.  Consideration is warranted of disqualifying conditions E2.A8.1.2.1., any drug abuse, and E2.A8.1.2.2., illegal drug possession, 
including purchase, under guideline H.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive provides for mitigation of illegal drug involvement if the drug use was not recent (E2.A8.1.3.1.), it was isolated or aberrational (E2.A8.1.3.2.), 
there is demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future (E2.A8.1.3.3.), or satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including 
rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional (E2.A8.1.3.4.).  Strictly 
in terms of the passage of time, his drug involvement is not especially recent.  However, a determination as to the risk of relapse must take into account not only 
the date of last use, but also the extent and duration of involvement and the circumstances of use.  The more serious or long term the abuse, the stronger the 
evidence of rehabilitation must be to overcome the negative security implications of that conduct.  For some thirty-two years, Applicant saw no problem with 
the recreational use of marijuana despite its illegality.  Although Applicant reported a waning interest in the drug in 2000, he was still purchasing it for personal 
consumption.  Applicant bears a particularly heavy burden to demonstrate not only that he has abstained from marijuana since October 2000, but that he will 
not relapse into abuse of marijuana in the future.  Applicant indicated in his December 2000 interview the arrest was a "wake-up call" which led him to realize 
smoking marijuana could result in serious criminal penalties for a probation violation.  With Applicant subject to random drug testing during his probationary 
term, there was a significant deterrent to marijuana use through December 2001.  A year further removed from his drug use, and with "significant insight" 
gained during his court-mandated alcohol driver education program into "the issues of CD and SA," Applicant did not return to illegal drug use after his 
probation ended.  The discharge record of the alcohol education program confirms Applicant's testimony that he took responsibility for his alcohol and 
marijuana abuse and full advantage of the opportunity to educate himself about substance abuse.  Applicant's use of marijuana, especially while he had a 
security clearance, is not condoned, but there is little risk, if any, Applicant will abuse marijuana in the future.  Subparagraphs 2.a., 2.b., 2.c., 2.d. and 2.e. are 
resolved in his favor. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's lack of candor about his illegal drug involvement raises security concerns independent of whether he will use any marijuana in the future.  When 
Applicant completed his SF 86 in January 1999, he falsely denied that he had used any illegal drug in the last seven years.  Applicant was also found to have 
deliberately omitted from the security clearance application that  he had been arrested in 1993 for illegal marijuana possession.   The deliberate omission, 
concealment or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire is potentially security disqualifying (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">See</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> E2.A5.1.2.2. 
under personal conduct), as it could indicate that the individual may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To Applicant's credit, he detailed his alcohol and drug abuse when he was interviewed by a DSS agent on December 13, 2000.  The DOHA Appeal Board 
reaffirmed in ISCR 01-06166 (decided on October 25, 2001), that where a case involves disclosures by an applicant that are corrections of an earlier 
falsification, E2.A5.1.3.3. (individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts) rather than 
E2.A5.1.3.2. (falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily) is proper for 
consideration.  Applicant's effort at rectification came more than a year after the SF 86 misrepresentations, so it cannot reasonably be viewed as prompt.  It is 
also  not clear whether Applicant volunteered his involvement with marijuana before he was confronted with the illegal drug possession charges.  Moreover, 
while Applicant admits he lied about his drug use primarily to protect his job, doubts linger for his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness because of his 
inconsistent explanations for the omission of the 1993 drug charge from his SF 86.  During his December 2000 interview, Applicant indicated he had been 
found not guilty on all counts in 1993 and he expressed surprise that he did not list his arrest on his SF 86 as he thought he had listed it.  In answer to the SOR, 
Applicant indicated he had been found not guilty of the OUIL, but the marijuana possession charge had been continued without a finding.  In addressing 
specifically the omission of the 1993 charges from his SF 86, Applicant related he thought he had been cleared of all charges (therefore he did not need to list 
them).  Yet, in acknowledging his "mistake" in responding "No" to question 27 (regarding any illegal drug use in the last seven years), Applicant admitted not 
only his drug use but also his arrest "made matters of [his] future even more uncertain."  He continued, "I tried to justify my reasoning in that I was found not 
guilty of the charges and I believed my use of marijuana use [sic] was diminished."  At the hearing, Applicant testified on direct that he answered the inquiry 
into any alcohol or drug arrests in the negative as he took the not guilty finding as a "no criminal" charge and the question did not apply.  Yet, when asked on 
cross examination whether he responded negatively to the drug arrest in order to protect his job, Applicant affirmed it was his motivation and he just panicked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By certifying that his statements on his security clearance application were "true, complete and correct to the best of [his] knowledge and belief," Applicant 
violated Title 18, Section 1001 of the United States Code.<A HREF="01-18027.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Under guideline J, criminal conduct, the fact that Applicant has never been formally charged with 
that statute does not preclude its consideration for security purposes, as any criminal conduct is potentially security disqualifying.  E2.A10.1.2.1., allegations or 
admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, must also be considered in evaluating his current security worthiness.  
Rehabilitation of serious criminal conduct requires a showing of remorse as well as a demonstrated track record of reform.  Although Applicant has expressed 
regret at his lack of candor on his SF 86, he stressed his "improper answer" was not intended to gain some new benefit, such as a higher clearance, from the 
Government.  The fact that the SF 86 was completed at the behest of his employer rather than on his initiative does not change in any way his obligation to be 
completely candid with the Government at all times.  Unable to conclude with the requisite degree of certainty that Applicant's representations can be 
completely relied on, subparagraphs 3.a., 3.b., and 4.a. are resolved against him.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">          In the context of the whole person analysis, Applicant presents many years of dedicated contributions to his defense employer.  Yet, in continuing to use 
marijuana in known disregard of its illegality, and in lying about his drug use to protect his job, Applicant exhibited a tendency to act in self-interest, which is 
incompatible with retention of a security clearance.   With respect to his marijuana use, Applicant justified his failure to adhere to the laws proscribing use on 
the basis his drug use was not harming anyone else.  With regard to the SF 86 falsification, Applicant maintains he was only deceiving himself.  At one point, 
he indicated to the Government he had persuaded himself that his marijuana use was somehow diminished because he had been found not guilty of legal 
charges filed against him.  The Government has a compelling interest in ensuring that those granted access can be counted on to fulfill their fiduciary 
responsibilities without due regard to their personal needs or desires.  The cessation of drug use and his candor during his DSS interview are not enough to fully 
restore his credibility with the Government.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Applicant testified he held a Confidential security clearance for fifteen to twenty years at the time he completed his SF 86 in late January 1999.  (Transcript p. 
38).  Department Counsel confirmed only that Applicant was granted an Interim Confidential security clearance in March 1999.  (Transcript p. 20). 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Applicant is alleged to have falsified a Questionnaire for National Security Positions of January 26, 1999.  The only SF 86 of record is an EPSQ version dated 
by Applicant on January 26, 1999.  From experience, these two security clearance application forms are similar in the nature of the inquiries, but not identical.  
Regarding illegal drug use, question 27 on the EPSQ version is question 24a on the QNSP as revised September 1995.  There is no evidence Applicant 
completed more than one version of the security clearance application on January 26, 1999.  Since the questions Applicant is alleged to have falsified are those 
which appear on the SF 86 EPSQ version, the reference to the QNSP appears to have been inadvertent.   
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>During his case in chief, Applicant testified with regard to his omission of the 1993 arrest he believed a not guilty finding equated to no charges against him.  
As reflected in his response to the SOR, while Applicant was found not guilty of the OUIL, he was aware the marijuana offense had been continued without a 
finding.  In expressing his belief that he thought he had been cleared of the charges, he admitted his nervousness about his future ("While this is no excuse for 
my behavior in this matter, the notion of my drug use and arrest made matters of my future even more uncertain.").  When asked on cross examination whether 
he answered the inquiry into any drug arrest in the negative because he wanted to protect his job, Applicant answered, "Well, at the time yes, that was my 
motivation, was to protect my livelihood. . . " (Transcript p. 48). 
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>The submission of the SF 86 may well have been in conjunction with a required periodic reinvestigation of Applicant to assess his continued suitability for 
access, although it is not clear.
