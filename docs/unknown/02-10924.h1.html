<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 24 July 2003 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-10924.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> recommending denial or revocation of 
Applicant's clearance.  Applicant answered the SOR and requested an administrative decision on the record on 9 September 2003. He did not respond to the 
Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM)--issued 10 December 2003; the record in this case closed 4 February 2004, the day the response was due at 
DOHA. The case was assigned to me on 4 May 2004 to decide if clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted  the allegations the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate these admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He previously served on active duty with the U.S. Navy 
from 1990 to 1996, and had  a clearance from 1993 to 1996 concomitant with that duty.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 2000, Applicant was arrested for--and later convicted of--DWI. On 12 January 2001, he falsified his Security Clearance Application by failing to 
disclose this arrest, either in response to a question requiring him to disclose any alcohol-related arrests,<A HREF="02-10924.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> or in response to questions requiring him to disclose 
any pending charges or any arrests, charges, or convictions not listed elsewhere on the application.<A HREF="02-10924.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his March 2003 statement, Applicant denied falsifying his clearance application, and explained that he had omitted the arrest because he had just been 
arrested and had not been to court yet. In his September 2003 Answer, he again denied any intent to falsify his clearance application and claimed he did not 
understand the question and thought he did not have to report this arrest.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record is otherwise silent on Applicant's character or work performance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive establishes adjudicative guidelines for evaluating security clearance eligibility. An Administrative Judge must consider the factors 
raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also assess the Section 6.3. factors 
of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines 
should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, 
recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PERSONAL CONDUCT (GUIDELINE E)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2A5.1.1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Concern</SPAN>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. . . </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2. A5.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts  from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established its case under Guideline E. Applicant knew he had been arrested for DWI only weeks before applying for his clearance, yet 
decided that information was none of the Government's business. While the failure to disclose did not prevent the Government from discovering the arrest and 
the arrest itself was found to have no current security significance as evidence of alcohol abuse, neither fact is relevant to an assessment of Applicant's fitness 
for access to classified information. The Government has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse information about an Applicant before 
making a clearance decision. The Government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information. Further, an applicant's willingness to report 
adverse information about himself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security violations or other security concerns in the future, 
something the Government relies upon to perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of classified information. Applicant's conduct suggests he is 
willing to put his personal needs and assessment of his privacy issues ahead of legitimate Government interests.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's varying explanations for his omission are neither reasonable nor credible. The plain language of the alcohol-or-drug-related arrest question requires 
Applicant to report that he was charged, regardless of the disposition of the offense. Further, Applicant falsely answered "no" to a question that required him to 
disclose any pending charges. He also falsely answered "no" to a question that required him to disclose any other arrests or charges not covered elsewhere on 
the application. Finally, Applicant previously applied for--and obtained--a clearance while in the Navy. I do not believe he was ignorant of the kind of 
information the Government seeks from an applicant before granting access to classified information. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
