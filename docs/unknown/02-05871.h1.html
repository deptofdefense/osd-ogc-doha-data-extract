<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  In accordance with the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-05871.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 
and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-05871.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 6 January 2003 detailing why a clearance was not granted and 
recommending Applicant's case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether the clearance should be denied/revoked.  In the SOR, DOHA 
alleged Applicant failed to meet the financial considerations (Guideline F), criminal conduct (Guideline J) and personal conduct (Guideline E) personnel 
security guidelines of the Directive.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 18 February 2003.  The case was assigned to me on 10 March 2003.  On 12 March 2003, a Notice of Hearing was 
issued scheduling this case for 3 April 2003.  On 27 March 2003, the Government moved to amend the SOR.  On 3 April 2003, I convened a hearing to 
consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  I granted the Government's motion to amend.  As the 
Applicant had not had 15 days to prepare for the matters contained in the amended SOR, I granted his request for a continuance until 1 May 2003.  The 
Government's case consisted of seven exhibits.  Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted 11 exhibits.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the 
proceeding on 9 May 2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 51-year-old network engineer with a master's degree in computer information systems.  Ex. 1 at 1; Tr.24.  He is married and has four children.  
Ex. 1 at 3; Tr. 25.</P> 
 
<P>Question 36 of the security clearance application (SCA) Applicant signed and submitted on 19 October 2000 asked if "[i]n the last 7 years, have you had a lien 
placed against your property for failing to pay taxes or other debts?"  Applicant answered, "Yes," and listed a $600 lien from the court of common pleas.  There 
is no evidence that a $600 lien was recorded against Applicant in the past seven years.  The evidence established the following liens against Applicant in the 
seven years before he completed the SCA:</P> 
 
<P>(1) On 16 January 1990 a lien was entered on a judgment in the amount of $1,125 for unpaid taxes recorded in a judgment on 23 June 1989.  Applicant satisfied 
the judgment and the lien was released on 2 April 2001 (as alleged in SOR &para; 1.f.).  Ex. G at 1</P> 
 
<P>(2) On 27 June 1995, a lien was entered on a judgment in the amount of $4,584.83 for unpaid taxes recorded in a judgment on 10 August 1994 (as alleged in 
SOR &para; 1.g.).  Applicant satisfied the judgment and the lien was released on 30 August 1999.  Ex. 5 at 3;Ex. I.</P> 
 
<P>(3) In June 1994, a lien was entered on a judgment for the state Department of Taxation on 9 June 1993 for approximately $2,165 (as alleged in SOR &para; 1.h.).  
Ex. G at 4.  Applicant paid the judgment on 9 July 1996.  Ex. 5 at 2.</P> 
 
<P>(4) On 26 October 1994, a lien was entered on a judgment in the amount of $99.69 for unpaid taxes recorded in a judgment on 29 March 1994 (as alleged in &para; 
1.i.).  Ex. I at 2.  Applicant paid the judgment on 28 October 1994.  Ex. 5 at 5.</P> 
 
<P>In addition, Applicant has other unpaid debts:</P> 
 
<P>(1) Debt of $109 from 1997 written off by a cellular telephone company-Applicant subsequently paid off this debt on 23 March 2003.  Ex. 3 at 4; Ex. C at 1.</P> 
 
<P>(2) Traffic ticket of $50 from 1997 referred for collection-Applicant subsequently paid off this debt on 23 March 2003. Ex. 3 at 6-7; Ex. C at 1.</P> 
 
<P>(3) Delinquent account with communications company from 1996 for approximately $68 referred for collection-Applicant paid off this debt on 23 March 2003.  
Ex. 3 at 7; Ex. C at 1.</P> 
 
<P>(4) Delinquent account with hospital #1for $50 referred for collection-Applicant paid this debt on 23 March 2003.  Ex. C at 1.</P> 
 
<P>(5) Delinquent account with hospital #2 for $117 referred for collection.  Answer.  It was paid on 30 April 2003.  Ex. F.</P> 
 
<P>(6) Applicant failed to file his federal income taxes for tax years 1994, 1995, 2000, and 2001.  He has not satisfied delinquencies of $2,195.  Tr. 39; Answer at 
1.  He did not timely file his federal tax returns, or a request for an extension, for tax year 2002.  Tr. 39-40</P> 
 
<P>(7) Applicant failed to file his 1998 state income tax return.  He is indebted to state for $5,888.39 for unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest.  Ex. 5 at 6; Tr. 37-38; 
Ex. D.  </P> 
 
<P>(8) Applicant failed to file his 1999 state income tax return.  He is indebted to state for $6,373.09 for unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest.  Tr. 38; Ex. 5 at 7; 
Ex. D. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant also failed to file state tax returns for tax years 1990-91 and 1998-2001.  Ex. 5.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus 
or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations 
should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR as amended, DOHA alleged under Guideline F that Applicant had a history of financial difficulties.  Specifically, he had a number of debts he had 
not satisfied (&para;&para; 1.a.-1.f); three state tax liens that had been satisfied (&para;&para; 1.g.-1.h); an outstanding debt for federal taxes to the IRS; that the combined income of 
Applicant and his wife is sufficient to pay off his debts (&para; 1.k.); and three debts to the state for unpaid taxes (&para;&para; 1.l-1.n) .  Under Guideline F, an individual who 
is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence that Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations (DC 1) and has been unable or 
unwilling to satisfy these debts (DC 3).  Applicant contended that his financial difficulties stemmed from a business failure in 1988, and thus, were beyond his 
control.  MC 3.  But Applicant admits making choices on which bills he would pay and which he would not, and that paying for the college education of his 
four children was more important than paying his debts.  Tr. 15.  Therefore, neither MC 3 or any other mitigating condition applies.  Finding is against 
Applicant except for subparagraphs 1.k. and 1.l.  The fact that Appellant was, at times, able to pay his debts (SOR &para; 1.k.) is relevant and material evidence of 
his security suitability, however, it is not a disqualifying condition.  The record contains no evidence relevant to the allegation in SOR &para; l.l.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR as amended, DOHA alleged under Guideline J that Applicant willfully failed to file federal tax returns for 1994, 1995, and 2000 (&para; 2.a.); and failed 
to file state income tax returns for 1990-91 and 1998-2001 (&para;&para; 2.b.-2.g.).  Under Guideline J, a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</P> 
 
<P>Any person who is required to do so and willfully fails to file a federal tax return is guilty of a misdemeanor.  26 U.S.C. &sect; 7203.  Appellant asserted that he 
thought he was going to receive a refund and that he thought he did not have to file a return under those circumstances.  Tr. 17.  After carefully listening to 
Applicant and observing his demeanor, I find his statements to be incredible.  In fact, he owed the IRS money.  Furthermore, without filing a return, how would 
the IRS know whether they owed him a refund?  Applicant committed multiple misdemeanors.  DC 2.  None of the mitigating conditions listed under this 
guideline apply.  Finding is against Applicant on SOR &para; 2.a.</P> 
 
<P>It is a felony to knowingly fail to file a state income tax return.  <EM>See </EM>Ex. 7 at 1-2.  I am convinced Applicant knew of his duty to file, but did not do so because it 
was inconvenient and to do so would notify the tax authorities that he owed them money.  The Government established that Applicant knowingly failed to file 
state income tax return for tax years 1990-91 and 1998-2001.  Applicant committed multiple serious offenses.  DC 2.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  
Finding is against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR as amended, DOHA alleged under Guideline E that Applicant falsified his security clearance application by listing only one of the liens that had 
been levied against him in the previous seven years.  Under Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  
Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l. </P> 
 
<P>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a security clearance application is conduct that raises a security 
concern.  DC 1.  Applicant claims he did not deliberately omit any information from <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">his SCA.  I am convinced Applicant knew of these liens.  DC 1 applies.  
None of the mitigating conditions listed under this Guideline apply.</SPAN></P>
