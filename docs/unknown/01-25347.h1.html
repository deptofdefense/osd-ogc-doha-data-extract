<P>The Applicant falsified a Questionnaire for National Security Positions by severely understating the amount of her drug use.  This falsification was not

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 6, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 16, 2003, and requested that the case be decided without a hearing.  </SPAN>The Government submitted its 
File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on May 2, 2003.  The Applicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit any documents in 
rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation.  The Applicant received the FORM before May 14, 2003, and submitted no additional information<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  The case was received 
by the undersigned on June 18, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 27, single and has an Associate of Arts degree.  She is employed by a defense contractor as an administrator, and she seeks to obtain or retain a 
DoD security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the exhibits.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Abuse)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has used illegal 
drugs.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant began using illegal drugs when she was in high school.  She used and purchased cocaine from 1993 through 1994, when her use was discovered 
by her parents.  The Applicant states in her Answer to the SOR that she only used cocaine on weekends.  However, in her sworn statement she says, "I would 
use it 3 times a day at school with friends at break, lunch and after school.  I used it on the weekends when I could attend parties."  (Government Exhibit 5 at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant began using marijuana about the same time she began using cocaine.  Concerning her use she states, "I used marijuana about once a day on 
weekdays and numerous times on weekends at parties."  She stopped using marijuana in approximately January 1998.  During the entire time she used 
marijuana she also purchased it.  (Government Exhibit 5 at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, the Applicant used and purchased crystal methamphetamine beginning in about 1996.  "I used Crystal Meth on a weekend basis until about Jan 98.  I 
start Friday night through Saturday night using the drug."  (Government Exhibit 5 at 3.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant stopped using drugs when she was hired by her defense industry employer.  That was because she might be required to take random urinalysis.  
She does not intend to use any drugs in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she falsified 
material facts about her drug background during the clearance screening process.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 9, 2000, the Applicant filled out a Questionnaire for National Security Positions in which she was asked, "Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, 
whichever is shorter, have you illegally used a controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, 
codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?"  
(Government Exhibit 4 at Question 27.)  In response, the Applicant stated that she had used cocaine 5 times between 1994 and 1995, and marijuana 12 times 
between 1994 and 1997.  The Applicant did not admit her use of crystal methamphetamine at all.  These were false answers to relevant questions concerning the 
Applicant's history of drug abuse.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When questioned about the marijuana and cocaine usage numbers, the Applicant stated that she was uncertain about the number of times she had used each 
drug, so she picked a number not realizing how important being accurate was.  (Government Exhibit 5 at 2.)  Regarding her failure to list her crystal 
methamphetamine use at all she stated, "I did not reflects (<EM>sic</EM>) my meth usage in my security paperwork because I felt that I stated enough information of my 
prior drug use that it was not of any importance to my security clearance.  I thought I recall stating the use of Crystal Meth in my security clearance paperwork.  
After reviewing the paperwork in my interview I learned I did not therefore I openly revealed all pertinent facts."  (Government Exhibit 5 at 3.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline H (Drug involvement)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) any drug abuse;<A HREF="01-25347.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) the drug involvement was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may have foreign connections that demonstrates untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting or continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with 
evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of 
persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has used illegal drugs (Guideline H); and that she 
intentionally made false material statements to DoD (Guideline E).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case against her, except in part.  Applicant's cocaine use ended nine years ago.  Her crystal methamphetamine and marijuana use ended almost six 
years before the record closed.  She evinces a credible intent not to use any drugs in the future.  Accordingly, Guideline H is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders, and it is a negative factor for security clearance purposes where an 
Applicant has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of his or her personal background.  The Applicant's explanation that she just 
picked a random number out of her head is simply not tenable.  Even assuming she only used cocaine on weekends for two years, that is well over 100 times.  
Five years of almost daily marijuana use adds up to close to 1000 times, not twelve.  Finally, her failure to list crystal methamphetamine use at all is viewed as 
intentional and not an accident.  Guideline E is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's efforts at reform are noted, and she is commended for her decision to refrain from further drug use.  Under the particular circumstances of this 
case, this evidence does not overcome the adverse information that has been presented by the Government.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, 
the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 2 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.  
As set forth above, Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
