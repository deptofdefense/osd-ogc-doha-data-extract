authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a 
position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to 
United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, 
honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to

alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as DWI.  DC 1.  While Applicant's two convictions for possessing alcohol as a minor are alcohol related, they 
do not evidence the excessive alcohol consumption that is the basis for the Guideline G security concern. </SPAN></P>

the point of blacking out on his 21<SUP>st</SUP> birthday.  "Binge drinking is defined as 'the consumption of five or more drinks in a row on at least one occasion.'"  Dept. 
Health &amp; Human Services and SAMHSA, <EM>National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information</EM>, http://www.health.org/govpubs/phd627/binge.aspx

Feb. 20, 2003), the administrative judge concluded that the applicant was involved in binge drinking.  The applicant in that 
case had been arrested for DWI twice, once after consuming five mixed drinks at a restaurant and on another occasion after having 10 mixed drinks in an 
evening while he was at home.  On appeal, the Appeal Board held "[t]here is insufficient record evidence to support a finding that Applicant engaged in 
'habitual or binge consumption of alcohol' within the meaning of Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition 5 (Directive, Enclosure 2, E2.A7.1.2.5)."  
ISCR Case No. 02-15358 at 7 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2003).  They did not define binge drinking nor did they explain why this did not amount to binge drinking.</SPAN></P>

That incident and Applicant's continuing to 
drink during his alcohol counseling program are of concern.  Nevertheless, there is no requirement that even an alcohol dependent applicant completely abstain 
from consuming alcoholic beverages, <EM>see</EM> ISCR Case No. 96-0869, 1997 DOHA LEXIS 665 *10 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, 1997), and the evidence of record supports 
a conclusion Applicant is not alcohol dependent.  A licensed clinical social worker has attributed Applicant's problems with alcohol to "moving through 
adolescence into young adulthood."  Ex. A; <EM>see</EM> Ex. B. The issue is whether an applicant's consumption of alcohol, both past and present, is such that it may 
lead to the exercise of questionable judgment and failure to control his impulses such as to increase the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</SPAN></P>

MC 1.  Applicant clearly understands the seriousness of his position--another alcohol-related 
incident would cost him his security clearance and probably his job.  Tr. 27, 60-66; Exs. A, B.  He has matured, made positive changes in his behavior 
supportive of sobriety (MC 3) such as reducing the amount of alcohol he consumes and the number of times he does so.  Applicant's counselor has given him 
high marks for his maturity and interest in understanding the triggers that caused his problems, believes Applicant "does not present as having a propensity for 
alcohol or substance abuse related issues," and concludes that Applicant's "prognosis is good for continued awareness and self-control."  Ex. B at 2.  Under the 
circumstances, finding is for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
