<P> Applicant mitigated security concerns over foreign influence from his family and other ties to his country of birth, India. Given his strong ties to the United 
States (US) where he has lived 25 years and as he has been a naturalized citizen since 1984, I conclude there is no substantial likelihood that his family ties 
would lead to foreign influence over Applicant. Further, Applicant has a long history of responsible conduct in the US military where he had a security 
clearance for twenty years.  I conclude it is improbable that foreign pressure on his family would create a situation that could result in the compromise of 
classified information or subject him to duress.  Further, his references attest to his good character and professionalism at work. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on October 29, 2002.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="02-00543.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over foreign influence (Guideline B) in paragraph 1. Applicant  replied to the SOR allegations 
in an Answer notarized on November 18, 2002, and requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel who attested it was ready to proceed on December 20, 2002.  Although initially assigned to another judge, the 
case was reassigned to me on December 20, 2002.  Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for hearing was agreed to and a Notice of Hearing issued on 
January 7, 2003, set the matter for hearing on February 14, 2003.  At the hearing the Government introduced two exhibits (Exhibits 1 &amp; 2) and asked that I take 
official notice of two documents (Exhibits I and II).  (TR 10, 14-17)  Applicant did not object, so I admitted Exhibits 1 &amp; 2 in evidence and Exhibits I and II for 
Official Notice.  Applicant represented himself; he testified and offered two exhibits (Exhibits A and B) which were admitted into evidence. (TR 17-20) He 
requested seven days to submit additional evidence which I granted him until February 21, 2003; she had three days to review the documents.  (TR 23-24, 45) 
On February 19, 2003, Applicant submitted three documents (Exhibits C, D, &amp; E) which the Department Counsel reviewed; on February 20, 2003, she advised 
she had no objection, so Exhibits C, D, &amp; E were admitted into evidence; and the record closed.  The  transcript (TR) was received on February 20, 2003.</P>

</P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P>

(Exhibit 2; TR 41)   He stated he would be diligent in reporting any overseas or foreign suspicious contacts.  He would never engage in illegal conduct because 
of his relatives.  (TR 42-444)  While he has the following overseas foreign relatives, none have any connection with a foreign government.  (Exhibit 2)  </P> 
<UL> 
  <LI>He has a brother who became a naturalized US citizen in July 2001 and has resided in the US for ten years; he has a sister who is a citizen of India, but has 
resided in the US for seven years, has a green card, and has applied for US citizenship in July 2002.  (SOR 1.a.)   (Exhibits 1, 2; TR 23-24, 32-; Exhibit C

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  The mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration 
of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>B - Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><STRONG>The concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2)  may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the 
potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial 
interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or 
pressure.</STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P> 
<P>1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country;</P> 
<P>3. Relatives, cohabitants, or associates who are connected with any foreign government;</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.      A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question 
are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
<P>3. Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent;</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant has mitigated security concerns over foreign influence raised by Applicant's close ties of affection to citizens of a foreign country: he has siblings 
who are citizens of India as well as friends from India and his wife has relatives who are citizens and reside in South Korea.  The security concern under 
Guideline B, Foreign Influence, is that a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family. . . and other persons to whom he or she may be bound 
by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (3) or have relatives who are connected with any foreign government who may 
be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  While I 
have considered these concerns,  I conclude Applicant has presented sufficient evidence to meet the burden<A HREF="02-00543.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> those circumstances presents.  </P> 
<P>While born in India, Applicant  came to the US to work in 1977 and joined the US military in 1979 before he became a US citizen.  He became a naturalized 
US citizen in 1984 and has not returned to India in twenty years.  Significantly, even before he became a US citizen, he was granted a security clearance in 
1980.  Later, he was granted  SCI access and a Top Secret clearance in 1991, and a Secret clearance again in April 2000.  He had a successful military career 
and retired honorably.  Moreover, Applicant made evident that if there were any hint of coercion or pressure on himself of his family, he would immediate 
report such coercion to the appropriate US officials.  </P> 
<P>Foreign influence security concerns are mitigated<A HREF="02-00543.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> by the fact that his contact and correspondence with foreign relatives are infrequent; his brother lives in the 
US and is now a US citizen.  One sister has a green card, lives in the US, and has applied for her US citizenship.  Another lives in Canada and is a Canadian 
citizen; another lives in India; but neither have any ties to those governments.   He has minimal contact with his wife's family and her son who live in South 
Korea; none have any ties to the government.  Further, he is no longer in touch with some of his foreign friends and has limited contact with another friend.  As 
his family and one friend who lives in the Dominican Republic have no formal ties to this foreign government; I conclude that there is no substantial likelihood 
that they would be subject to duress and thus exercise foreign influence over Applicant or create a situation that could result in the compromise of classified 
information.  His friendships and ties to the Embassy of India while he was posted with the US miliary in South Korea more than twenty years ago, no longer 
raise any concern especially in light of his US military career. Thus, I conclude Applicant is not vulnerable to duress merely because of these family and 
friendship ties.   </P> 
<P>Security clearance decisions are predictive judgments about an applicant's security eligibility in light of the applicant's past conduct and present circumstances.  
<EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).  Contacts with citizens of other countries are relevant to security determinations only if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure through threats against those foreign relatives.  Acts indicative of foreign influence 
warrant careful scrutiny.  </P> 
<P>After considering the Enclosure 2 Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I conclude these ties are not of such a nature as to create any 
tangible risks of undue pressure on Applicant; so foreign influence security concerns are mitigated.  Thus, I resolve SOR paragraph 1 and subparagraphs 1.a. 
through 1.j. in Applicant's favor.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER>

<P>After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process 
section, I make the following formal findings:</P>

circumstance places "a very heavy burden on Applicant " to show that family ties there do not pose a security risk.  The Government did provide some 
information for Official Notice that both India and South Korea engage in economic espionage against the US, but that does not establish a hostile relationship.
