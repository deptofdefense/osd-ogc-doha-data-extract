<P>Applicant accessed numerous pornographic web sites on a computer owned by his government contractor employer during a five-day period in January 2001. 
He also failed to fill out his time card on a daily basis as required by government regulations during that same time period. He has mitigated the security 
concerns caused by his conduct.  Clearance is granted.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On December 8, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-00987.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline M (misuse of information technology systems), Guideline E (personal conduct), and Guideline D (sexual 
behavior) based upon Applicant's conduct in accessing pornographic web sites on his employer's computer and failing to fill out his time card on a daily basis 
as required by government regulations. Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR on January 6, 2004, denied the allegations contained in the SOR, and 
requested a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on May 24, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on June 7, 2004, scheduling the hearing for June 15, 2004.<A HREF="03-00987.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The hearing was 
conducted as scheduled. The government called the Applicant to testify in its case-in-chief, presented one other witness, and submitted 12 documentary exhibits 
that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-12, and admitted into the record without an objection.  The Applicant testified, called five witnesses to testify 
on his behalf, and submitted one documentary exhibit that was marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) 1, and admitted into the record without an objection. The 
transcript was received July13, 2004.        </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 41-year-old man who has been married since August 1990. He obtained a bachelor of science degree in May 1989, and has worked for various 
federal contractors as either an engineer or systems analyst since November 1991. He has worked as an engineer for his present employer, a defense contractor, 
since July 1997. He has possessed a secret security clearance since March 1992. He self-reported a security violation he committed in October 2002 based upon 
his forgetting to enable a motion sensor while charged with the responsibility of closing up a secure facility at the end of the work day. No actual compromise 
of classified information occurred as a result of this incident because of the redundant security systems in place. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant presented the testimony of several character witnesses, including the founder and CEO, the president, the vice president, and the manager of his 
present employer. They have each worked closely with him for as much as 12 years, and each have sound foundations for the opinions they expressed. 
Collectively, they established that Applicant is a good and respected employee who has a reputation of being honest, dedicated, and conscientious. They were 
each aware of the reasons for the hearing, but still expressed their opinion that Applicant is a man who follows rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">At the time of the incidents in question, Applicant was working under a government contract at a facility owned by a contractor other than his employer. While 
working at the other facility, Applicant was provided with a computer by his employer that was installed in the other facility and routed through the other 
contractor's server. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant accessed pornographic web sites on numerous occasions on January 15, 16, 18, and 19, 2001. His access of those sites was detected by a security 
system on or about January 25, 2001, and he was immediately escorted from the premises and his access to the premises was terminated. The security system 
printout disclosed  he accessed approximately 10 sites between the hours of 10:31 a.m. and 11:13 a.m. on January 15, 2004, approximately 20 sites between 
6:13 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. on January 16, 2001, approximately 30 sites between 7:25 p.m. and 8:27 p.m. on January 18, 2001, and approximately 40 sites between 
5:34 p.m. and 7:49 p.m. on January 19, 2001. He also accessed a single site for thirty seconds at 1:36 p.m. on January 16, 2001. The great majority of the sites 
were only accessed for a few seconds, although some were viewed for nearly 30 minutes. Applicant testified he accessed the sites out of curiosity.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was required to record the hours he worked on a daily basis on a timecard he was required to obtain from and return to his employer's place of 
business during each pay period.<A HREF="03-00987.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> He failed to record his daily hours worked on a number of days between January 15, 2001, and January 26, 2001 because of 
what he attributes to either laziness or sloppiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's employer conducted an investigation of the infractions after being notified of the alleged offenses and Applicant's termination by the other 
contractor. Applicant admitted accessing the pornographic web sites and claimed they were accessed after work hours or during his lunch hour. The security 
detection system printout, as detailed above, for the most part confirms the sites were accessed outside of what would be considered normal work hours or in 
the proximity of what may have been a lunch hour. However, no definitive evidence, other than Applicant's statement, exists as to whether or not the sites were 
accessed during working hours because he was allowed to work an irregular schedule. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant claimed he was unaware of any employer policy he violated by accessing the pornographic sites outside work hours on their computer. The employer 
did not have an internet policy in effect at the time, and thus the investigation concluded he was actually unaware of any company policy that would have 
prohibited him from using a company computer to access pornographic web sites outside working hours. The investigation also concluded that Applicant had 
not committed timecard fraud by failing to record his hours worked on a daily basis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Although Applicant's employer concluded he had not violated an internet use policy or engaged in timecard fraud, it did impose disciplinary action upon him 
because he had been perceived by one of its costumers as not performing his job in a professional manner. Applicant was placed on leave without pay from 
January 27, 2001 until February 25, 2001. He was also counseled and issued a final warning that any future violation of his employer's policies would result in 
immediate dismissal. There has been no subsequent misconduct by Applicant.           </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline M, 
pertaining to misuse of information technology systems, Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, and Guideline D, pertaining to sexual behavior, with their 
respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-00987.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-00987.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="03-00987.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="03-00987.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-00987.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-00987.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-00987.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-00987.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-00987.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="03-00987.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>     </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline M, noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns 
about an individual's trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to properly protect classified systems, networks, and information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's employer conceded following its investigation and through the hearing testimony of its senior executives that there was no policy in effect in 
January 2001 that prohibited an employee from using a company-owned computer to visit a pornographic web site outside work hours. There is no evidence to 
establish Applicant used his computer to do so during his working hours, although the timing of the use on January 15, 2001, and the 30 second use on January 
16, 2001 are suspect. Regardless, Applicant's conduct, while exhibiting extremely poor judgment, did not implicate any disqualifying condition under 
Guideline M.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">To the extent Applicant's conduct may have violated the intent of Guideline M, even if it did not violate any specific disqualifying condition, that conduct is 
substantially outweighed by the facts that it occurred three and one-half years ago, over a very short period of time, in the course of an otherwise excellent 
career. Applicant is entitled to credit under Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The misuse was not recent or significant</EM> and MC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The misuse was an isolated 
event</EM>. Applicant has mitigated whatever security concerns may have existed under Guideline M.     </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline E, personal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's conduct in accessing pornographic web sites on his employer's computer while working in a customer's facility is a clear demonstration of 
unquestionably poor judgment. Even though his employer did not have a policy that prohibited such use and the use itself was not criminal, Applicant's failure 
to comprehend and appreciate how that use would be viewed by the customer placed in question whether he is a person who could be trusted. Further, his 
failure to record the hours he worked, as required by applicable DoD regulations, even though it did not rise to the level of timecard fraud, showed his 
willingness to disregard rules. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances</EM>; DC 4: 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities 
which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail</EM> and DC 5: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A pattern of 
dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency </EM>are all applicable.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant terminated his pornographic web surfing before it was discovered. His misconduct was quickly discovered, and he was just as quickly severely 
disciplined for his transgressions. Most important, the testimony of his employer's senior management establishes that he learned from his mistakes and they 
are extremely unlikely to ever be repeated. Further, it once again should be pointed out that his misconduct occurred over a very brief and isolated period of 
time in what has otherwise been an excellent career. I have considered all Guideline E mitigating conditions and find that MC 5: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The individual has taken 
positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM> applies in this case. Considering the total evidence presented 
in this case, I find Applicant has mitigated the security concerns that existed under Guideline E.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, may subject the individual to coercion, exploitation, or duress or reflects a lack of 
judgment or discretion. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant credibly testified he viewed the various pornographic web sites out of curiosity. Although those sites contained graphic sexual images, there is no 
evidence any of them contained child pornography or other criminal content. There also is no evidence that this was compulsive behavior on the part of 
Applicant. While arguably DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress </EM>could be said to apply, I do not 
find this the type of behavior contemplated as included under Guideline D. It is appropriately considered under Guideline E as noted above. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">To the extent that Applicant's conduct may be deemed to be of concern under Guideline D, he is entitled to credit for the applicability of MC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The behavior 
was not recent and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature </EM>and MC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, 
exploitation, or duress</EM>. Applicant has mitigated whatever security concerns may have existed under Guideline D.  </SPAN></P>
