<P>The Statement of Reasons (SOR), does not cite or refer to Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program</EM> (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, but it 
does cite DoD Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  A memorandum from the Deputy 
Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) to Director, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), dated November 19, 2004 states DOHA shall utilize provisions of the 
Directive to resolve contractor cases involving trustworthiness determinations.  In this case, the pertinent disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the Regulation and the Directive are the same.  
The Regulation, paragraph C8.2.1 provides that the procedural rules of the Directive apply for contractor personnel.   </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>On August 17, 2004, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Standard Form (SF) 85P.<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  On August 31, 2006, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a SOR to her, pursuant to the Directive.<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations), E (Personal Conduct) and J 
(Criminal Conduct) and details reasons why DOHA recommends that Applicant's case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination that she is not eligible for occupying an ADP 
I/II/III position.  Disqualifying and Mitigating Conditions for Guidelines E, F and J are in the Regulation at pages 142-144 and 150.  </P> 
 
<P>In a notarized answer, received at DOHA on September 18, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided at a hearing.<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  On October 31, 2006, the case 
was assigned to me.  The hearing was held on November 29, 2006.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on December 14, 2006, and I received it on December 15, 2006.  I held the record 
open (R. 51, 53), to permit Applicant to submit additional matters, and on January 3, 2007, she provided additional documentation concerning her financial matters.<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>    </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations under Guideline F, Applicant admitted that she was responsible for twenty of the twenty-two debts alleged in the SOR, and under Guideline E, she admitted the the 
falsification allegation without elaboration.<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  She did not respond to the Guideline J allegation. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of 
the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 53 years old (R. 6).<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Since June 1997, she has been employed by a United States government contractor and is involved with processing sensitive medical records (R. 8, 49).<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  She has 
no prior military service.<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  She attended a technical college from 1972 to 1975 and received an Associates degree in business (R. 6).<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  She was never married<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  She has three children (R. 25), and 
over the years received some financial support, but did not receive court ordered child support (R. 32).  Her youngest child is now 23, and none of her children are not part of her household (R. 
31).<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  She provided financial support for her 30 year old daughter from 1998 to 2002 and to another child while they were attending college and unemployed (R. 27, 31). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In November and December 2006, Applicant paid or resolved twelve debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.j - 1.l, 1.n, 1.q, 1.r, and 1.t - 1.v, which totaled $1,025.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The nine SOR debts that are scheduled for resolution through a payment play are in &para;&para; 1.a, 1.f - 1.i, 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.s.  The debts included in her payment plan total $10,861.  The debt in SOR &para; 
1.d of $305 is disputed because she believed she had paid the creditor (R. 33-34).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant currently has two part time jobs to provide additional income (R. 25).  One job pays $220 and the other pays $110 per month (R. 28).  She had difficulty managing a checking account (R. 
26).  She closed her checking account two years ago because she wrote at least two bad checks that bounced, and she could not maintain an accurate record of her balance (R. 27, 29). Sometimes 
she forgot about writing checks, or thought they had cleared her account already (R. 28).  In the past she attempted to pay her creditors.  However, her vehicles that she used for transportation to 
work would break down, her children would need something, or some other problem would occur, and she was prevented her from paying her debts (R. 30, 35-36).  She inherited the home where 
she lives and has no rent or mortgage payments (R. 30; Ex. C at 2).  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A witness with excellent financial and business credentials (W) made a statement on Applicant's behalf (R. 38-48).  W assisted Applicant as a volunteer without receiving remuneration for her 
services.  W met with Applicant every two weeks for two months and provided financial counseling, which included budgeting, eliminating unnecessary expenses (such as cable television), debt 
tracking, saving, maintaining contact with creditors, meeting goals and obligations, and assembling an emergency fund (R. 40-41, 46-48).  W arranged for a charitable organization to loan Applicant 
several hundred dollars so that she could pay her smaller debts to help establish her trustworthiness, and maintain her employment (R. 41, 44). Applicant's debt to the charitable organization will be 
paid out of her next tax refund (R. 42).  Applicant only has one credit card and is supposed to pay her debts using money orders (R. 44).  W maintains contact with her clients to ensure they stay on 
their budget and pay their debts according to their payment plans (R. 42).  According to Applicant's payment plan, her debts will be paid in 26 months (R. 43; Ex. C-D). W promised to continue to 
work with Applicant and expressed confidence that Applicant understood her financial responsibilities and would comply with her budget and payment program (R. 48; Ex. C-D). </SPAN></P>

($410), allowance ($52), savings ($25), rent ($0), groceries ($75), utilities (power, sewer, water and telephone) ($150), insurance (payroll deduction), vehicle expenses ($548) and recreation ($10).  
The 2006 PFS meets the goal of her debt reduction plan by providing $410 per month. The PSF did not list any assets.</P>

<P>Question 22b asks, "<STRONG>YOUR FINANCIAL RECORD </STRONG>Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation?  Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal 
Government."  Applicant answered, "No."  SOR &para;&para; 2.a and 3.a allege that this answer is false. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following colloquy provides Applicant's rationale for failing to answer, "Yes," in response to Question 22b:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Administrative Judge (AJ):  Why didn't you put the debts on the form?</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A.  Sir, I didn't - well, my understanding - I really didn't thought (sic) that it was  (sic) necessary (sic) had to be done.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">AJ.  Why?</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A.  I didn't know that my job would have any effect to (sic) my credit. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">AJ.  You mean, you understood the question?</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A.  Yes, sir.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">AJ.  That they were asking for your debts, and you just put, "No"?</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A.  Because I didn't know that - really, I didn't thought (sic) it was any meaningful (sic) for them knowing it.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">AJ.  Were you embarrassed about it, or - I mean, why not just put it - put the information down, or at least say - write, yes, I have lots of debts, you know, if you didn't want to, you know, track it 
down and get the specifics and all that?</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A.  Probably - I think - I was embarrassed.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">( R. 50-51).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant further explained, "I didn't know that my job might depend on the information that  - that you asked (sic) on the (sic) - what we had to  - clearance came (sic), the people came there.  I 
didn't know it was important.  They didn't express (sic) to us like that.  They just said this - well, I guess I shouldn't say it but I will say this - [s]he said just fill out - just fill it out, she said.  Just 
put something on there.  That was told (sic) to me."  ( R. 54).  Applicant agreed with Department Counsel that her motivation was to avoid embarrassment (R. 55).  She commented that she did not 
realize that she had so many delinquent debts until she saw her credit report (R. 55).  She said she learned from her mistakes (R. 60), and she promised in the future to ensure she provided 
completely accurate information on trustworthiness forms, even if she had to provide embarrassing information (R. 54).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I carefully observed Applicant's demeanor as she addressed the falsification of her SF 85P.  I am convinced she answered, "No" because she did not believe it was important to the government to 
have information about her delinquent debts, and to avoid embarrassment.  At her hearing she responded in a forthright, candid manner to the best of her ability.  Her intention was not to deceive the 
government into erroneously making a positive trustworthiness determination.  Moreover, her lack of understanding of the importance of accuracy affected her answers.  She lacks sophistication 
about financial matters, as shown by her inability to balance her check book.  She was very careless in the preparation of her SF 85P, as demonstrated by her failure to list her children on her SF 
85P. After considering all the record evidence, I find that she was truthful at her hearing about her rationale for answering, "No" to Question 22b.</SPAN></P>

<P>In the evaluation of an Applicant's security suitability for a public trust position, an administrative judge must consider Appendix 8 of the Regulation, which sets forth brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, and the adjudicative guidelines, which are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC). </P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision at Appendix 8 of the Regulation.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.</P> 
 
<P>To be eligible for a public trust position, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Regulation.  "The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, 
based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security."  Regulation &para; C6.1.1.1. </P> 
 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk."  Regulation, Appendix 8.  
Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.  Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed in 
the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 132: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency

<P>Since the protection of sensitive information is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that eligibility for a public trust position is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying 
condition under the Directive. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating

mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly 
consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive &para; E2.2.2.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks eligibility for a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal 
duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants eligibility for a public trust position.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard  
sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  The 
scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. </SPAN>Applicant's failure to pay her debts is of concern, especially in light of her desire to have access to sensitive government information. 
Appendix 8 of the Regulation clearly expresses the government's concern regarding financial considerations, stating, "an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in 
illegal acts to generate funds." <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect sensitive 
information.</SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's actions in failing to satisfy her outstanding financial obligations give rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1, "a history of not meeting financial 
obligations," and FC DC 3, "inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts."  FC DCs 1 and 3 apply to her failures to meet her financial obligations, and her admission that she was unable or unwilling 
to pay her debts.  Her SOR debts remained delinquent for several years.  Nine SOR debts are being resolved through a payment plan.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The government produced substantial evidence of these two 
disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
government.<SUP><A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, "the behavior was not recent;" FC MC 2, "it was an isolated incident;" FC MC 3, "conditions that resulted in the behavior 
were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation;" FC MC 4, "the person has received or is 
receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control" and FC MC 6, "the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts."  Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole,<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> I conclude FC MCs 1 and 2 do not apply because Applicant had multiple (nine) 
delinquent SOR debts that were not paid, settled or sufficiently resolved at the time the record was closed.   </P> 
 
<P>FC MC 3 does not apply and FC MC 4 partially applies to her SOR debts.  Although her debts became delinquent several years ago and were the result of payments to assist her children and to 
make repairs to vehicles needed to transport her to her employment, these changes in circumstances are not the types of unforseen problems that trigger application of FC MC 3.  These  situations 
are not "largely beyond the person's control" because a prudent persons plans for their children to attend college and sets aside funds to maintain their vehicles.  There is a paucity of evidence 
showing how she endeavored to pay or resolve her delinquent SOR debts over the last three or four years.  In regard to FC MC 4, there is sufficient evidence that she received and is applying her 
financial counseling.  She is making progress to resolve her delinquent SOR debts.  Based on the sincerity of her testimony, and the other record indicia of improved financial self-discipline, I have 
some confidence that she is on the right track now towards correction of her financial problems.  I will apply some credit for FC MC 4 under the whole person analysis, <EM>infra</EM>.    </P> 
 
<P>FC MC 6 does not apply because there is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of her debts.<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN>  She does, however, receive some credit in the whole 
person analysis, <EM>infra</EM>, for the application of the 3-year South Carolina statute of limitations, which applies to all except three of her unpaid SOR debts.  <EM>See</EM> S.C. Code. Ann. &sect; 15-3-530.<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  The 
South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application of the statute of limitations:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Statutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they</SPAN> stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and stability to human affairs.  The 
cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.  Significantly, statutes of limitations provide potential 
defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred claims.  Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their 
rights.  Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.</P>

<P>Elimination of all of her delinquent debt load (except for three debts totaling $1,122) through the statute of limitations and her utilization of W's debt payment plan have ended her potential 
vulnerability to improper financial inducements because she is no longer "financially overextended."  However,  it does not negate her past conduct, which caused and then failed to resolve her 
financial jeopardy.  Aside from her conscientious work on her financial problem the last two months, she has not provided sufficient information about how she attempted to resolve or repay SOR 
debts.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Under Guideline E, "conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that a person may not properly 
safeguard classified information."  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two personal conduct disqualifying conditions (PC DC) could potentially raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  PC DC 2 applies where there has been </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"deliberate 
omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . used to . . . determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness . . . ."  A 
security concern may result under PC DC 3 when an applicant deliberately provides "false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to a . . . security official . . . or other 
official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For PC DCs 2 and 3, Applicant admitted that she gave a deliberately<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> false or incorrect answer to Question 22b of her 2004 SF 85P.  Although she did not fully understand the implications of 
Question 22b, she did understand the question itself.<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> 
<P> Her confusion and carelessness are extenuating, because they show less of an intent to deliberately deceive.  Nevertheless, they do not excuse 
or mitigate her conduct. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on Guideline E may be mitigated by evidence of personal conduct mitigating conditions (PC MC). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Under PC MC 1, security concerns may be mitigated when the 
derogatory "information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegation in SOR &para; 2.a are established by substantial evidence, 
and constitute deliberate falsifications.  </SPAN></P>

</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  PC MC 2 does not apply, but she receives some credit under the "whole person" 
analysis because only one false SF 85P was submitted to the government on August 17, 2004, approximately 30 months ago.<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Additionally, she made a belated, good-faith effort to correct the 
record when she admitted her SF 85P contained incorrect information in her response to the SOR on September 18,  2006 (albeit after being confronted by the facts), and at her hearing.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Although 
her eventual admission that the clearance entry was false was not "prompt," she deserves some credit under the "whole person" concept for providing accurate information in 2006. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">PC MC 4 applies  when "[</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">o]mission of material facts was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted information 
was promptly and fully provided."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  There is no evidence that anyone gave Applicant improper or inadequate advice or suggested that she omit information from her SF 85P. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Security concerns can 
be mitigated under PC MC 5 when an applicant "has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress."<EM>  </EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Id</EM>.  Under PC MC 5, Applicant 
receives some credit for eventually disclosing her financial problems.  Any steps made toward rehabilitation are insufficient in magnitude and too recent to support full application of PC MC 5.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Under Guideline J, a history or pattern of criminal activity raises questions regarding an applicant's willingness or ability to protect classified information and </SPAN>creates doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.    </P> 
 
<P>Two criminal conduct disqualifying conditions (CC DC) could raise a security concern in this case.  CC DC 1 applies where there are "any conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally 
charged" and CC DC 2 applies in situations where an applicant has committed "a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses."   </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR </SPAN>&para; 3.a alleges that she violated 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 by falsifying an answer on her 2004 SF 85P.  As indicated previously, I find that she deliberately falsified her 2004 SF 85P.  For a violation of 
18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 to occur, however, the falsification must be material.  The Supreme Court defined "materiality" in <EM>United States v. Gaudin</EM>, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (1995): as a statement having a 
"natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision making body to which it is addressed."  <EM>See also United States v. McLaughlin</EM>, 386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004).   If Applicant had provided an accurate answer to Question 22b of her SF 85P, this accurate answer was capable of influencing the government to deny her security clearance.  As indicated 
previously, her delinquent debts were sufficiently recent and serious<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> to jeopardize her security clearance application.<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  As such, her omissions to her SF 85P were material.  Accordingly, CC 
DCs 1 and 2 apply because Applicant committed a single serious offense, a violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001, which is a felony.  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Security concerns based on criminal conduct can be mitigated by showing that it was not recent (CC MC 1).  There are no "bright line" rules for determining when conduct is "recent."<A HREF="06-16782.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  If the 
evidence shows "a significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct," then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates "changed 
circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation."  <EM>Id</EM>.  Applicant's last SOR-alleged incident of criminal conduct was her false statement, when she filled out her 
SF 85P in 2004.  However, the SOR allegation of criminal conduct must be considered along with all the other evidence when applying this mitigating condition.  She was forthright and candid 
when addressing her culpability at her hearing on November 29, 2006.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN>However, viewing her conduct as a whole, CC MC 1 does not apply.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal conduct security concerns may be mitigated under CC MC 2 when the "crime was an isolated incident," or under CC MC 3 when an applicant demonstrates she "was pressured or coerced 
into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in that person's life."  CC MCs 2 applies because Applicant committed a single falsification of her SF 85P.  Moreover, she was 
subsequently honest about her false statement at her 2006 hearing.  Still, CC MC 3 does not apply because no one caused her or influenced her to commit the criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct may be mitigated under CCMC 4 when an applicant "did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to 
recur," and under CC MC 5 when "[t]here is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation."  Applicant voluntarily committed the criminal conduct and CC MC 4 does not apply.  The cause of the 
falsification, an attempt to avoid embarrassment, will not recur because she fully disclosed her financial information.  CC MC 5 applies because she is successfully rehabilitated.  She understands 
the importance of being completely honest, and will provide embarrassing, private information in the future.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A NAME="cp248"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 
132<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">. As noted above, Applicant's lengthy history of failing to meet her financial obligations, her inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts, and </SPAN>her false statement on her 2004 SF 85P <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> raise 
serious trustworthiness concerns.  She is currently 53 years old, and sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her conduct.  Her actions in generating or failing to resolve her debts in a timely 
fashion and her falsification  were knowledgeable and resulted from voluntary choices to <SUP></SUP>purchase items, to obtain services and to not disclose derogatory financial information.  However, her 
inability to repay her debts resulted from funds she provided her children and vehicle problems.  Since October 2006, she paid eleven debts, disputed two others, and placed the remainder of her 
delinquent debts into an debt repayment plan. There is substantial evidence of financial rehabilitation, positive behavior changes, receipt of financial counseling in 2006, reduction of overall debt 
and improved circumstances as indicated by self-discipline and good budget counseling. </SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Her falsification occurred approximately 30 months ago and her subsequent statement admitted her 
omission was deliberate. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The motivation for the falsification was to conceal information about her financial problems to avoid embarrassment, it was not designed to deceive or trick the government 
or her employer into continuing her employment.  </SPAN>The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low.  Applicant is current on her debt repayment plan, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and her positive employment 
history since 1997 supports a determination of trustworthiness. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">She is aware that the government and her employer have the derogatory financial information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The likelihood of recurrence is low. 
Changes resulting from counseling and greater awareness of financial responsibilities as well as W's assistance will result in a trend of improved financial circumstances.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">I am confident that she

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In sum, </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's financial case shows her willingness to apply self-discipline and her debt management plan to resolve her delinquent debts, even to pay some debts she is not legally required to 
pay because of the South Carolina 3-year statute of limitations.  She has a debt payment plan, and W will maintain contact with her and assist with establishing and reinforcing positive financial 
practices.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has </SPAN>mitigated the trustworthiness 
concerns pertaining to financial considerations, personal conduct and criminal conduct.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other 
good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant's debts.  The Directive does not define the term 'good-faith.'  However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith 'requires a showing 
that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.'  Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a 
legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6. </SPAN></P>
