<P>Applicant is a 38-year-old electronics technician who has worked for the same defense contractor since November 2002. Following his involuntary military discharge in 2000, Applicant experienced a 
period of protracted unemployment. In 2001, he and his wife filed for bankruptcy and they divorced in 2002. He addressed the seven delinquent debts at issue, and shown that all but one have been 
satisfied or disputed. His evidence indicates that the remaining debt was included in the couple's bankruptcy. Applicant mitigated security concerns. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On June 2, 2005, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) concluding it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant him a security clearance.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under </SPAN>Guideline F (Financial Considerations). <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a notarized statement, 
dated June 24, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He admitted two of the nine allegations raised under Guideline F, submitted documentation regarding the remaining allegations, and 
requested a personal hearing. After moving abroad in furtherance of his employment, Applicant, on May 15, 2006, withdrew his request for a personal hearing in favor of a determination based on the 
record. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM),<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> dated August 8, 2006. Included in the FORM was a Motion to Amend the SOR to include an additional guideline, Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct). Applicant received a complete copy of the FORM on August 21, 2006, and was given the opportunity to submit documentary information in rebuttal, or to explain adverse 
information in the FORM. He was also requested to file any objection to Department Counsel's Motion to Amend the SOR with his response to the FORM. A response, dated September 18, 2006, was 
timely submitted. In his response, Applicant presented additional explanation regarding the adverse information in the FORM and constructively opposed the amendment to the SOR. </SPAN>The case was 
subsequently assigned to me on October 4, 2006.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PRELIMINARY MOTION</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>In his Motion to Amend the SOR, Department Counsel seeks to attach an additional guideline to the SOR of which Applicant had no prior notice. Specifically, Department Counsel seeks the addition of 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) based on the allegation that Applicant falsified material facts in response to allegation 1.c of the SOR which alleges "You are indebted to [automobile manufacturer 
credit account], in the amount of $23,404.00, the balance owed after resale of your automobile which was repossessed for nonpayment in October 2000. As of November 21, 2003, this debt had not been 
satisfied." In his response, Applicant stated "I deny the above statement. The [account] was filed with bankruptcy courts. I contacted [the merchant's credit recovery department] spoke with Ron and 
confirmed this information. Balance due after sale of the automobile was estimated to be $9,000 as reported by Ron at [the recovery department]. According to credit report dated 06-09-2005, this 
account has been closed." </P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel now seeks to allege, under Guideline E, that Applicant "knew said response in [his] Answer was false at the time [he] made it, <EM>because [he] did not include this vehicle and the 
specific debt with [the manufacturer's credit recovery department] with your bankruptcy petition.</EM>" (emphasis added)  Had the motion merely sought to amend the SOR with an additional financial 
allegation under Guideline F in order to render the SOR in conformity with the evidence admitted, Applicant would have already been on notice that his finances, in general, raised security concerns.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
Under such circumstances, his input might rightly be limited to an objection to the motion, with additional preparation time afforded upon request.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>Here, however, Applicant was not previously provided any notice that the his personal conduct or the security concerns posed under Guideline E were at issue. They were raised for the first time after he 
chose to pursue a determination based solely on the written submissions, rather than personally appear before the Department, regarding what was purported to be a comprehensive and detailed SOR.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> 
By now attempting to expand the SOR with the addition of a new and distinct guideline, and consequently an entirely different litany of security concerns of which Applicant had no prior notice, 
Department Counsel has potentially abrogated Applicant's right to personally appear before the Department regarding a comprehensive and detailed SOR, as provided under the Directive. To have 
afforded Applicant the opportunity to request a personal appearance before the Department on this new and distinct guideline would have posed little more administrative burden than did Department 
Counsel's invitation to him to object to the motion at issue. Indeed, to have afforded him this opportunity would have been in better keeping with both the spirit of the Directive and the basic tenets of 
administrative notice.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>Furthermore, and of more practical concern, Department Counsel has not presented evidence making a <EM>prima facie </EM>case<EM> </EM>of falsification. Department Counsel argues that Applicant did not list an 
obligation arising from the balance owed after resale of a repossessed vehicle in his bankruptcy petition .<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN> This is incorrect. The repossessed automobile is noted as having been repossessed within the 
prior year on the bankruptcy petition's Statement of Financial Affairs, Continuation Sheet No. 1.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> For the above-stated reasons, I deny Department Counsel's Motion to Amend the SOR.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's answers to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 38-year-old electronics technician who has worked for the same defense contractor since November 2002. He served in the U.S. Army from June 1986 to June 1990, and received a 
discharge at the rank of Corporal [E-4]. He was married in May 1991, and he returned to the Army in October 1995. He eventually achieved the rank of Sergeant [E-5]. </P> 
 
<P>On March 8, 2000, Applicant was discharged from the Army for medical reasons. After his discharge, he remained unemployed until approximately November 2002. In the interim, his 1999 mid-sized 
Volkswagen valued, at $20,000, was repossessed on or about January 6, 2001.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>As debts mounted, Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on May 1, 2001. That petition was converted to a Chapter 7 filing on or about May 22, 2001, with liabilities of approximately 
$220,197. The majority of their unsecured debt of nearly $35,000 was due to unpaid credit cards and personal loans.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> The repossessed vehicle was listed in the Statement of Financial Affairs under the 
section for "Repossessions, foreclosures, and returns." Schedule D of the bankruptcy petition noted the other 1999 vehicle with a value of $21,000.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Applicant and his wife reaffirmed their obligation 
on the latter vehicle by retaining it for her use, while the remainder of their debt was discharged on September 12, 2001. Nearly a year later, on October 16, 2002, Applicant and his wife were 
divorced.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> As part of the divorce settlement, Applicant's wife assumed possession of, and the obligation for the non-repossessed vehicle.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>On February 26, 2003, Applicant completed an SF-86, and a background check was commenced. A June 2, 2005, SOR raised nine allegations, to which Application responded:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SOR &para; 1.a: CHAPTER 13 BANKRUPTCY, CONVERTED TO CHAPTER 7 BANKRUPTCY, DISCHARGED ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2001:</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> Applicant admits this allegation.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> </P>

existence of the debt, he contacted the merchant, reached a settlement in the amount of $360, and paid that amount in full on or prior to June 10, 2005.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions 
(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and 
material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding 
circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or 
undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this 
policy guidance.</P> 
 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> The government has the 
burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> Once its burden is met, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of 
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against her.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security 
clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations</SPAN>. <EM>The Concern</EM>:</STRONG></SPAN> An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Conditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate the security concerns raised in this matter, are 
set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the applicable legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). The government demonstrated that Applicant accrued some delinquent debts over the past few years. Consequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 
E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>) apply. </P> 
 
<P>With the government's burden met, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. Applicant was discharged in March 
2000 for medical concerns and remained unemployed until November 2002, during which time debts accrued and an auto was repossessed. Such facts raise FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>the conditions that 
resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation</EM>)). </P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted that he and his ex-wife were discharged from bankruptcy in 2001, prior to their divorce. He also showed that as part of the divorce settlement, she took sole financial control over the 
obligation on her vehicle. He admitted that he formerly owed $250 to a retail chain for items repossessed from his ex-wife, but noted that he satisfied this obligation on, or prior to, June 10, 2005. 
Applicant has shown that one account at issue, from a bank recovery department, was included in his bankruptcy. He has also shown that one telecommunications company's account opened by his ex-wife was erroneously attributed to him, and that another has no nexus to him and has been disputed. Applicant has also demonstrated that a debt allegedly owed a financial institution for $661 has been 
put into dispute. </P> 
 
<P>As for any balance owed on the repossessed auto, the evidence shows that the vehicle was properly included on the bankruptcy petition's section for recent repossessions. The creditor was properly 
served twice with a copy of the Applicant's discharge, presumably one copy for each of the two cars noted in the petition. Inasmuch as deficiencies on repossessed automobiles are generally discharged 
under Chapter 7 unless they are reaffirmed, the evidence indicates that this debt was properly discharged and its continued inclusion on his credit bureau report was in error.<A HREF="04-08547.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> Given the actions taken to 
address his obligations and to correct his credit report, FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 ([<EM>t</EM>]<EM>he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) applies.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the facts and evidence in this matter. I have also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests with 
regard to the security concerns raised. He is a mature man who resorted to bankruptcy after being discharged from the Army and finding himself unemployed for a protracted period of time. He was 
discharged from bankruptcy over five years ago and currently lives within his means without apparent difficulty or distress. When DOHA called into question seven past debts it believed to have 
survived the bankruptcy or been accrued since that discharge, he showed that he personally satisfied one debt, created by his ex-wife without his knowledge, prior to the issuance of the SOR (&para; 1b) and 
has contested another account she opened without his knowledge (&para; 1.d). He also showed that he formally contested two accounts as being listed in his credit report in error (&para; 1.e and &para; 1.g) and that two 
of the accounts at issue were properly included in his bankruptcy (&para; 1.c and &para; 1.f). Moreover, he established that his ex-wife assumed responsibility over the Volkswagen she retained as part of their 
divorce settlement (&para; 1.h). In view of the facts presented, and in light of Applicant's continued solvency, the financial considerations security concerns raised have been mitigated. Clearance is granted.</P>
