<P>Applicant has a history of financial delinquencies.  In recent years, her income has increased, and her annual salary is now approximately $80,000.  While Applicant satisfied  many of her smaller 
delinquencies, at the time of her hearing she owed approximately $60,000 in federal and state tax liens. The federal tax liens encompassed the period from 1993 to 2002, and the state tax liens 
encompassed the period from 1998 through 2002. Although she had offers of compromise pending before federal and state tax authorities, Applicant had no concrete and verifiable plan to satisfy

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On June 12, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="05-14101.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of 
Defense Directive,<A HREF="05-14101.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on July 24, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me August 16, 2006. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant requested an expedited hearing and waived the 15-day notice rule specified at E3.1.8 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive.  On September 11, 2006, I convened a hearing to consider whether it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The Government offered nine exhibits for admission to the record.  The Government's exhibits 
were identified as Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 9 and were admitted into evidence without objection.  Applicant testified on her own behalf and called no other witnesses.  She offered ten exhibits for 
admission to the record.  Applicant's exhibits were identified as Ex. A through J and were admitted into evidence without objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open for one 
week so Applicant could, if she wished, supply additional information about her financial situation.  Before the record was closed, Applicant submitted three additional exhibits, which were 
identified as Ex. K, L, and M, and admitted to the record without objection.  On September 20, 2006, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR to which Applicant filed her answer contained four allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. At the hearing, the Government moved to amend the 
SOR to include a fifth allegation, which was identified as allegation 1.e. The  motion was granted without objection.  In her answer to the initial SOR and in her testimony regarding the amended 
SOR, Applicant admitted three allegations and denied two.  Her admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 42 years old, single, and, beginning in January 2005, was employed as a proposal services manager by a defense contractor.  In August 2006, she was promoted by her employer to 
manager of technical communication.  (Ex. 1, Ex. H, Ex. I: Tr. 76.)  Applicant is the single mother of two adult daughters, ages 24 and 18. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a fianc&eacute; who provides her with unspecified financial support and who helps pay the college tuition of Applicant's younger daughter.  Applicant and her fianc&eacute; are thinking about 
getting married in the fall of 2007.  (Tr. 49-50.)</P> 
 
<P>When Applicant's children were small, she did not receive child support and held low-paying jobs. She had difficulty providing basic necessities for her family.  In 2003, she was diagnosed with 
thyroid cancer and was hospitalized for approximately three weeks.  Her medical bills for her cancer diagnosis and treatment totaled $25,000.  Her cancer treatment was successful, and her heath is 
currently stable.  (Tr. 46-47.)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's employment history shows she held a number of positions, working her way steadily toward increased responsibilities and higher salaries. (Ex. 1; Tr. 45-46.)  Applicant's current 
employer recognizes her as an effective leader and manager, and she has received salary increases and performance awards.  Her current annual salary is approximately $80,000. (Tr. 48, 51; Ex. H, 
Ex. I.)  </P> 
 
<P>In August 2005, Applicant estimated her monthly take-home pay to be approximately $4,860. Her monthly household expenses were $3,523 and her household debts were $693, leaving a net 
remainder of $644. (Ex. 6.)  In March 2006, Applicant estimated monthly take-home pay of $4,491, total monthly expenses of $3,460, and household debts of $493, leaving a net remainder of 
$538.<A HREF="05-14101.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In addition to her ordinary household expenses, Applicant helps to care for her sick mother.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> (Ex. 8 at 2.)<A HREF="05-14101.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  She provides some support to her older daughter, who has acquired certification in 
sonography and is working as a medical assistant.  Applicant also provides her younger daughter,  a college freshman, with financial support for her education.   ( Ex. G; Tr. 48-49, 60-61.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a history of financial delinquencies.  Of particular consequence are delinquencies resulting from her failure to adequately pay her federal and state income taxes over a period of nine 
years.   In March 2003, a federal tax lien totaling $14,44.08 was entered against Applicant for tax years 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1996. (Ex. 2.)  In September 2004, a federal tax lien totaling 
approximately $39,581.13 was entered against Applicant for tax years 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2002.  (Ex. 3.)  In March 2005, a lien of judgment was entered against Applicant in her state of 
residence for unpaid state taxes, penalties, and interest totaling $12,704.08.  The state lien of judgment covered the years 1998 through 2002.  (Ex. 4.)  In 2003, Applicant overpaid her federal taxes 
by $2,385, and the overpayment was applied to pay her delinquent 1996 federal tax in full. (Ex. J.)  As of the date of her hearing, Applicant had not satisfied any other delinquencies charged against 
her in the three outstanding tax liens.  She provided evidence showing she had obtained tax counsel and had made offers of compromise to the federal and state tax authorities.  (Ex. A, Ex. B, Ex. C 
Ex. F, Ex. G.)  Her offer of compromise to the state taxing authority specified she would pay $4,940 within 90 days of acceptance.  (Ex. G.)  Applicant's submissions did not specify the nature or 
the amount of her offer of compromise to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  Applicant disputed the amount the IRS stated she owned in back taxes.  (Tr. 21-22, 38-39.)  She provided no evidence 
that she was setting aside funds to pay her delinquent state and federal taxes pending acceptance of her offers of compromise.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant also provided credible evidence showing that in June 2006, she had satisfied a judgment entered against her in October 2000 in the approximate amount of $2,659.  (Ex. D.)  Additionally, 
she presented credible evidence showing settlement in full as of June 27, 2006 of a charged-off account in the approximate amount of $593.  (Ex. E.)  Applicant acknowledged attending occasional 
lunchtime workshops given by her employer on financial management subjects.  (Tr. 56-57.) <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[No one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  
The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to 
abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security 
clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating the security 
worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of 
Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being 
eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions 
listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's concern under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, is that individuals who are financially overextended and unable or unwilling to pay their just debts may try to generate 
funds by engaging in illegal acts. Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1. Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations, and her financial history suggests an inability or unwillingness to satisfy her 
debts, conditions which raise security concerns under subparagraphs E2.A6.1.2.1. and E2.A6.1.2.3. of Guideline F.  DOHA's Appeal Board has concluded that "[a] person who is unwilling to fulfill 
his legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons granted access to classified information."  ISCR Case No. 98-0810 at 4  (App. Bd. 
June 8, 2000).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the amended SOR, DOHA alleged  that in about September 2004, a federal tax lien was entered against Applicant for outstanding federal income taxes owed for tax years 1997 through 2002 in 
the approximate amount of $39,581.13, and, as of March 10, 2006, the debt had not been satisfied (&para; 1.a.).  DOHA also alleged that in March 2003, a federal tax lien was entered against Applicant 
for outstanding federal income taxes owed for tax years 1993 through 1996 in the approximate amount of $14,044.88, and, as of March 10, 2006, the debt had not been satisfied (&para; 1.b.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The amended SOR also alleged that Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a judgment entered against her in about October 2000 in the amount of $2,659, and, as of March 10, 2006, the judgment 
had not been satisfied (&para; 1.c.); that Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a charged-off account in the amount of approximately $593, and, as of April 2, 2005, the debt had not been paid (&para;1.d.); 
and that on or about April 4, 2005, a state tax lien was filed against Applicant for outstanding state income taxes owed for the tax years 1998 through 2002 in the approximate amount of $12,704.08, 
and, as of August 11, 2006, this debt had not been satisfied (&para;1.e.).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established, through Applicant's admissions and the record evidence, a <EM>prima facie</EM> case that Applicant is financially overextended.  Applicant provided no persuasive evidence 
to rebut the financial concerns specified in the SOR and identified as disqualifying conditions under &para;&para; E2.A6.1.2.1. and E2.A6.1.2.3. of Guideline F.<A HREF="05-14101.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  While Applicant provided evidence she had 
made offers of compromise to federal and state tax authorities, she failed to identify the current specific amounts of her several tax obligations and to show she had a plan in place and sufficient 
resources to systematically repay her tax delinquencies. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided evidence that she had satisfied two of the five debts alleged in the amended SOR.  Those debts were identified at &para;&para; 1.c. and 1.d. of the amended SOR and are concluded for the 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We turn to a review of the several conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant's financial delinquencies.  Applicant's acknowledged financial delinquencies involve 
long-standing debts, and her inability or unwillingness to pay them is recent.  Thus, neither mitigating condition E2.A.6.1.3.1. nor mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.2.<A HREF="05-14101.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> applies.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant attributed her financial delinquencies in part to a low income and no child support while her children were young and to medical expenses resulting from her diagnosis and treatment of 
thyroid cancer in 2003.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">If a person's financial delinquencies were largely caused by conditions beyond his or her control, then mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.3 might apply.<A HREF="05-14101.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  The record shows that Applicant's tax 
delinquency problems dated to at least 1993 and seemed to predate her health concerns in 2003.  Applicant's illness, while unfortunate, does not explain or mitigate her long-standing financial 
difficulties and her unwillingness to set aside and save the necessary resources to pay her federal and state taxes.  While Applicant's parental responsibilities were no doubt heavy when she was 
raising  two children on her own, her long-standing tax delinquencies which have continued to the present do not appear to be the result of conditions beyond her control.  Thus, mitigating condition 
E2.A6.1.3.3. does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has attended occasional workshops on financial subjects offered at her workplace. However, she has not sought individual counseling in managing her financial situation, although she has 
engaged a firm to help her satisfy and resolve her federal and state liens.  Despite attending the workshops and hiring a firm to represent her with federal and state tax authorities, Applicant failed to 
present clear indications that her financial problems are being resolved or are under control.  Therefore, mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.4.<A HREF="05-14101.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> is applicable only in part.  Additionally, while Applicant 
resolved, before the hearing, two long-standing debts alleged in the SOR, and deserves some credit for paying her debts, she failed to demonstrate that she had in place a good-faith plan to pay or 
resolve approximately $60,000 in long-standing tax liens or had saved the money needed to act upon her offers of compromise.  Accordingly, I conclude that mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.6.<A HREF="05-14101.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> 
does not apply.  The possibility that Applicant might achieve resolution of outstanding debt at some future time does not constitute evidence of financial reform or rehabilitation in the present.  
ISCR Case No. 98-0614 (July 12, 1999) at 5.  The Guideline F allegations at &para;&para; 1.a., 1.b., and 1.e. in the amended SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  Security clearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past 
transgressions.  Rather, the objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  
Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts and omissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct.  Having done so, I 
conclude Applicant should not be entrusted with a security clearance.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors and guidelines in 
Department of Defense Directive, 5220.6., as amended. </SPAN></P>
