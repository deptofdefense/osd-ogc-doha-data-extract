<P>This 21-year-old applicant purchased a new small car in 2001, but after a few months was unable to make two successive insurance payments.  An auto 
accident totaled the now uninsured car, which was then repossessed, leaving a liability of $13,000, which Applicant was unable to pay.  The debt was 
discharged in bankruptcy under Chapter 7 in 2002.  She has a monthly net income of $1,400, which after expenses leaves a remainder of $60.  She is current on 
all of her financial obligations, except for a single debt of $37.  The record does not establish a pattern of financial irresponsibility.  She misunderstood the 
question about repossessions in her SF 86, and answered "No" because the debt was being discharged in bankruptcy.  Mitigation has been shown.  Clearance is 
granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On December 12, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons</P> 
 
<P>why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it</P> 
 
<P>is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative 
Judge to conduct proceedings and</P> 
 
<P>determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>On January 2, 2003, Applicant submitted a response to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative 
Judge on the written record, i.e., without a hearing.  Department Counsel issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on February 3, 2003, and Applicant 
received  it on February 18, 2003.  The Form instructed Applicant that any response to the FORM had to be submitted within 30 days of its receipt by 
Applicant.  The response was due on March 21, 2003.  Applicant did not submit any response to the FORM.  The matter was assigned to me for resolution on 
arch 25, 2003. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 20-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  The SOR contains three allegations, 1.a. - 1.c., under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and 
one allegation, 2.a., under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  In her response to the SOR, Applicant<EM> admitted</EM> all of the SOR allegations, without explanation 
(Government Exhibit (GX) 3).  All of Applicant's admissions are incorporated into this decision as FINDINGS OF FACT.  After considering the totality of the 
evidence derived from the FORM, including but not limited to Applicant's response to the SOR, I make the following additional FINDINGS OF FACT as to 
each SOR allegation:</P> 
 
<P>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</P> 
 
<P>1.a. - Applicant petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in November 2001.  Her unsecured debt of approximately $13,000 was discharged in February 
2002. </P> 
 
<P>1.b. - Applicant has a past due debt to Creditor A in the amount of $37, for a delinquent debt  turned over for collection.   </P> 
 
<P>1.c. - Applicant's Personal Financial Statement of November 14, 2001 indicates that Applicant is financially capable of paying the debt cited in 1.b., above, as 
evidenced by a monthly net remainder of approximately $60.</P> 
 
<P>Guideline E (Personal Conduct) </P> 
 
<P>SOR 2.a. - Applicant did not intentionally falsify a material fact on her security clearance application (SF 86), dated March 13, 2001, when she replied to 
Question <STRONG>35. YOUR FINANCIAL RECORD - REPOSSESSIONS</STRONG>, "In the last seven years, have you had any property repossessed for any reason?" by 
answering "No," and failing to cite the November 2000 repossession of her 2000 Mazda (GX 6). </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant</P> 
 
<P>in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding</P> 
 
<P>the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the</P> 
 
<P>individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)</P> 
 
<P>the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation</P> 
 
<P>for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood</P> 
 
<P>of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my 
overall conclusion.</P> 
 
<P>Because Applicant chose to have this matter decided without a hearing and without submitting any additional information in response to the FORM, all 
credibility determinations and findings of fact are necessarily based entirely on the contents of the FORM.  Considering the evidence as a whole, I find the 
following specific adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent.  </P> 
 
<P>GUIDELINE F (Financial Considerations)</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:</P> 
 
<P>3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</P> 
 
<P>Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>2. The behavior is an isolated incident;</P> 
 
<P>6. The individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</P> 
 
<P>GUIDELINE E (Personal Conduct)</P> 
 
<P>Condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:</P> 
 
<P>2. the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any security clearance application. </P> 
 
<P>Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>1. The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily;</P> 
 
<P>The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related 
to the ultimate question of</P> 
 
<P>whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  An applicant's admission of the information in specific 
allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are denied or otherwise controverted by the 
applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden 
(either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence</P> 
 
<P>of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>As of the closing of the record, Applicant was 20 years old.  The sole explanation for the conduct alleged in the SOR is found in her November 4, 2001 sworn 
statement to the Defense Security Service (DSS) (GX 5), at which time Applicant was about 19 years old.  The events described in the record began with her 
purchase of a new small car in June 2000, when she was 18, with a down payment of $2,500 and monthly payments of $325.00, in addition to which she paid 
$175.00 per month in insurance premiums.  A few months later, in September and October 2000, she was unable to pay her insurance premiums because of her 
low paying employment.  </P> 
 
<P>In November 2000, she was in a single vehicle accident, which she admits was caused by her relative lack of driving experience.  The car was effectively 
totaled.  When she filed an insurance claim, the insurance company informed her the policy had been canceled for lack of payment of premiums.  As a result, 
she decided she had no option but to allow the car to be repossessed, after which she learned she still owed $13,027 on the car loan.  She consulted with a 
paralegal and decided to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, rather than Chapter 13, because she did not have the money to make installment payments.  
She obtained a job at a grocery store within walking distance of her residence and did not need a car to function.  The Personal Financial Statement (PFS) she 
prepared as part of her sworn statement shows a monthly net income of about $1,400, monthly expenses of $1,325 (including $650 in rent), and a net remainder 
of $60, as alleged in SOR 1.c. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's explanation for why she did not mention the repossession in her SF 86 is that she was "listing it on [her] bankruptcy petition" (GX 5).  Although 
this rationale is not further discussed, I have evaluated it in the context of her age and financial immaturity, and I conclude the omission was not made with any 
intent to deceive.  The same PFS indicates that Appellant was making $25 per month payments on a hospital bill of $1,700 but not on the $96 debt cited in SOR 
1.b., which is given in her PFS as $127.  The most recent document of record, the September 16, 2002 credit bureau report (GX 7), gives the amount owed to 
this creditor as $37.  As stated in the SOR, the government is concerned because of Applicant's (1) Chapter 7 bankruptcy filed in November 2001, (2) her 
failure to pay a delinquent $96.00 debt to a  health care provider; and (3) the availability of an estimated $60.00 net remainder as shown in her PFS.</P> 
 
<P><EM>Financial Considerations </EM></P> 
 
<P>SOR 1.a. - This Applicant, then 19, filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in 2001, with the aid of a paralegal, because she had no money with which to pay the 
more than $13,000 demanded by the car dealer after the repossession of her ruined car.  Presumably, she had to convince a Federal Bankruptcy Judge that this 
legal remedy to terminating liability for a specific debt was appropriate under the circumstances.  The DoD security clearance process is based on findings as to 
an Applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Bankruptcies are generally not considered a negative factor in security clearance determinations 
unless the circumstances indicate an absence of such qualities.  These factors can include multiple bankruptcies, and evidence that debts were incurred with the 
intent to later avoid responsibility by filing for bankruptcy.  In the present case, Applicant is too young to have much of a financial history, but what history 
there is, as reflected in the credit bureau reports, shows minimal financial activity of any kind, and few problems. </P> 
 
<P>SOR 1.b. - As to the single past due debt cited in SOR 1.b. as $96, the most recent credit bureau reports it as $37.  The existence of a debt to this creditor is 
admitted by Applicant but there is no explanation as to whether all or part of it been paid.  Based on the totality of the record, I conclude that Applicant owes 
about $37 on this debt.  Applicant's PFS shows her to be current with her monthly expenses other than the $37 debt.  Under these circumstances, the record 
does  not show that she is presently "financially overextended." </P> 
 
<P>SOR 1.c. - The "$60" remainder figurer cited in the SOR is derived from Applicant's PFS, but in the context of around $1,400 in roughly equal monthly income 
and expenses, $60 is not much of a financial cushion.  Whatever adverse inference can be derived from the continued existence of this debt, its impact is 
minimal.  Applicant has expressed an intent to pay the remaining small debt  as her financial situation allows (GX 5). </P> 
 
<P><EM>Disqualifying and Mitigating Conditions </EM></P> 
 
<P>Condition that could raise security concerns and may be disqualifying includes:</P> 
 
<P>3. an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, applicable specifically to the $37.00 debt owed to creditor A.  In context of the entire record, this $37 debt does 
not constitute "an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts." </P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </P> 
 
<P>2.  the behavior was an isolated event;</P> 
 
<P>3.  the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond her control.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's failure to pay off the remaining $37 owed to Creditor A has not been explained by Applicant but, overall, the small amount of this single debt is not 
sufficient by itself, or along with the other evidence, to lead to a conclusion that Applicant lacks the financial judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required 
of anyone seeking a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P><EM>Personal Conduct </EM></P> 
 
<P>SOR 2.a. - Applicant's explanation is not easy to follow, but I have considered it in the context of decision making by this young and financially inexperienced 
individual, who has apparently otherwise been financially current.   In summary, I conclude that Applicant was not seeking to deceive the Government when 
she answered "No" to Question 35 on her SF 86.</P> 
 
<P><EM>Disqualifying and Mitigating Conditions </EM></P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could raise security concerns and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
 
<P>None that are established by the record.</P>
