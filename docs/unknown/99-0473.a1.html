<P>Administrative Judge John G. Metz, Jr., issued a decision, dated December 27, 1999, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the reasons set forth below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's
decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as
amended.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant knowingly falsified a security
questionnaire he completed in September 1998 and a written statement he gave in November 1998.; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security
clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated July 30, 1999 to Applicant.  The SOR was based on Criterion E
(Personal Conduct) and Criterion J (Criminal Conduct).  A hearing was held on November 17, 1999.  The Administrative Judge issued a written decision, dated
December 27, 1999, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case
is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from the Judge's adverse security clearance decision.</P>

</P>

<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant knowingly falsified a security questionnaire he completed in September 1998 and a written
statement he gave in November 1998</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge found that Applicant falsified a security questionnaire he completed in September 1998 when
he: (a) answered YES to question 24<A HREF="99-0473.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and listed a March 1990 arrest for driving under the influence, but did not list a February 1992 alcohol-related incident
that resulted in Applicant's arrest and conviction, an April 1994 alcohol and drug-related incident that lead to Applicant's arrest, or a November 1995 alcohol-related incident that lead to Applicant's arrest; and (b) answered NO to question 26<A HREF="99-0473.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> despite the fact that he had been arrested, charged, or convicted of
incidents that occurred in June 1993 (twice), August 1993, July 1994, and May 1995.  The Judge also found Applicant falsified material facts in a written
statement he gave to a federal investigator in November 1998 by stating that he had no traffic violations and no other arrests since 1994, even though he had
been arrested twice in 1995.  On appeal, Applicant argues he never intended to knowingly falsify any sworn statements, and he never tried to conceal or cover
up any of his past incidents.</P>

<P>During the proceedings below, Applicant denied any intent to falsify the security questionnaire in September 1998 and his written statement in November 1998. 
Applicant's denials were relevant and material evidence.  However, those denials were not conclusive and binding on the Administrative Judge.  Rather, the
Judge had to consider Applicant's denials in light of the record as a whole and his assessment of the credibility of Applicant's hearing testimony.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR
Case No. 99-0005 (April 19, 2000) at p. 3.  An intent to falsify can be shown by circumstantial evidence even in the face of denials of any intent to falsify.  <EM>Cf. 
Foster v. Dalton</EM>, 71 F.3d 52, 56 (1st Cir. 1995)("'Notwithstanding a person's disclaimers, a contrary state of mind may be inferred from what he does and from
a factual mosaic tending to show that he really meant to accomplish what he professes not to have intended.'")(quoting earlier decision).  A review of the
decision below shows the Judge took into account Applicant's denials of any intent to falsify, evaluated them in light of the record evidence as a whole, and
concluded they were not credible.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge had a rational basis to find that Applicant's omissions about his past
criminal record were intentional, not inadvertent or the result of a reasonable belief that his answers were correct.</P>

<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN>.  Applicant also argues: (a) since being
hired in June 1998, he has been a reliable, trustworthy, and dependable employee of a defense contractor; (b) he has received favorable evaluations from his
superiors; (c) since 1995, he has not been arrested or "had any other legal issues that would impair his opportunity to perform his job within government
guidelines"; (d) the Judge made favorable formal findings with respect to SOR subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.h.; and (e) his superiors gave favorable testimony
and letters of recommendation on his behalf.  The Board construes these arguments as raising the issue of whether the Judge's adverse security clearance
decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P>The federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to classified information.  <EM>Snepp v. United States</EM>,
444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).  Security clearance decisions are not an exact science, but rather are predictive judgments about a person's security suitability in
light of that person's past conduct and present circumstances.  <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).  The federal government need not
wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to properly handle or safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such
information.  <EM>Adams v. Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238-39 (D.C. Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  Direct or objective evidence of nexus is not required
before the government can deny or revoke access to classified information.  <EM>Gayer v. Schlesinger</EM>, 490 F.2d 740, 750 (D.C. Cir. 1973).  All that is required is
proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high
degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0296 (April 18, 2000) at p.
5.</P>

<P>Security clearance decisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's job performance.  An applicant with good or exemplary job performance may
engage in conduct that has negative security implications.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0123 (January 11, 2000) at p. 3. Falsification of a security questionnaire
or a written statement given to a federal investigator demonstrates poor judgment, untrustworthiness and unreliability that clearly has negative implications for
an applicant's suitability for a security clearance.  As discussed earlier in this decision, the Administrative Judge had a rational basis to find Applicant engaged
in deliberate falsification of material facts about his past criminal conduct.  The Judge's findings about Applicant's falsifications in September 1998 and
November 1998 provide a rational basis for the Judge's adverse conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility.</P>

<P>The favorable evidence cited by Applicant did not compel the Administrative Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  The Judge had to consider
the record evidence as a whole and consider whether the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 99-0296 (April 18, 2000) at p. 6.  Considering the record as a whole, the Board concludes the Judge did not weigh the evidence in this case in a manner that is
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>
