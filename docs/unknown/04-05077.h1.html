<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>On April 27, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="04-05077.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint,
alleges a security concern under Guideline B (foreign influence). Applicant submitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on May 16, 2005, and
admitted all SOR allegations except SOR subparagraph 1.b. By separate letter, dated June 15, 2005, Applicant indicated he did not want a hearing. However, on
August 10, 2005, Applicant sent a note to Department Counsel and stated he had changed his mind and was now requesting a hearing. (Appellate Exhibit I) </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on August 15, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on September 9, 2005, scheduling the hearing for September 29, 2005. The
hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted four documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-4. GE 1 was
admitted into the record, and administrative notice was taken of the information contained in GE 2-4 without objection. Applicant testified and submitted three
documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-3, and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on
October 17, 2005.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel moved to withdraw SOR subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b. based on documentary evidence presented to her before the hearing and subsequently

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I make the
following findings of fact:</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 65-year-old man who has been employed by a defense contractor as a senior tool and die maker since July  2002. He was previously employed
outside the defense industry as a senior machinist from January 1995 to July 2002, and as a tool and die maker from August 1987 to December 1995. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant immigrated to the U.S. from Germany in 1959, and became a U.S. citizen in November 1962. He was first married in October 1959, and divorced in
July 1968. He has three adult children from that marriage. Applicant married again in December 1974, and that marriage ended in divorce in May 1998.
Applicant has two children from his second marriage who alternate residing with him and his ex-wife.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Following his second divorce, Applicant began searching an internet website in an effort to find a woman outside the United States to marry. He made contact
with a Ukrainian woman through the internet site sometime in 1999 or 2000, and visited with her in Ukraine for about two weeks. After visiting with her,
Applicant decided she was not right for him, and so he once again searched the internet site for a prospective bride. He made contact with his present wife
sometime in 2000, and corresponded with her by e-mail and telephone for about one-year. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Although she was a Ukrainian citizen, Applicant's wife was living with her aunt and uncle in Moscow when she began corresponding with Applicant.
Applicant visited with her in Moscow on three occasions between 2000 and 2001, staying at her aunt's residence on each occasion, and eventually arranged for
her to come to the United States with her young daughter in 2001. They married in February 2001. Applicant adopted his wife's daughter, who is now ten years
old, in 2002, and she was issued a certificate of citizenship on May 18, 2004. Applicant's wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September 14, 2005.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's father-in-law is a 73-year-old widower who is a citizen and resident of a small town in Ukraine. He is a retired maintenance worker and lifeguard
supervisor. Applicant's brother-in-law is a 31-year-old citizen and resident of Ukraine. He is single, employed as a construction worker, and resides with his
father. Neither is employed by the Ukrainian government nor any subunit thereof. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's father-in-law visited with Applicant and his wife in the U.S. for about three months between December 2002 and March 2003. Applicant, his wife,
and his adopted daughter visited with his in-laws in Ukraine in April or May 2005. Applicant's wife speaks with her father by telephone approximately twice a
month, and with her brother when he chances to answer the phone when she calls her father. Applicant sends his father-in-law between $50.00 and $100.00
about every six months. He recently sent him $3,000.00 so he could purchase a pacemaker. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's wife is a college graduate whose sole employment for the two to three years she was residing in Moscow was babysitting her aunt's children. She
does not own any property outside the U.S., and transferred her interest in an apartment she owned in Ukraine to her father when she came to the U.S.       </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On December 25, 1991, the United States officially recognized the independence of Ukraine; and upgraded its consulate in the capital, Kiev, to embassy status
on January 21, 1992.<A HREF="04-05077.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Ukraine is undergoing profound political and economic change as it moves from its Soviet past toward a market economy and multiparty
democracy, and integration into Euro-Atlantic and other international institutions.<A HREF="04-05077.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The political, economic, and social transformations taking place in Ukraine
have caused perceived wealthier visitors, including Americans, to be targeted for criminal activity.<A HREF="04-05077.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN> The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine has received reports of
harassment and intimidation being directed against foreign businessmen and interests, ranging from physical threats, to local government entities engaging in
such practices as arbitrary termination or amendment of business licenses and "inspections" by officials that appear designed to harm the business rather than a
genuine attempt at good governance.<A HREF="04-05077.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN>  </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The United States attaches great importance to the success of Ukraine's transition to a democratic state with a flourishing market economy. . . .The Ukrainian
government's stated determination to implement comprehensive economic reform is a welcome development, and the U.S. is committed to strengthening its
support for Ukraine as it continues on this difficult path. Bilateral relations suffered a setback in September 2002 when the U.S. Government announced it had
authenticated a recording of President Kuchma's July 2000 decision to transfer a Kolchuga early warning system to Iraq. The Government of Ukraine denied
that the transfer had occurred. U.S. policy remains centered on realizing and strengthening a democratic, prosperous, and secure Ukraine more closely
integrated into European and Euro-Atlantic structures.<A HREF="04-05077.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1
through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline B,
pertaining to foreign influence, with its DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN>. A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound
by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon the allegations in the SOR, Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of
affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM> and DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of
their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse influence or duress exists </EM>must be evaluated in determining whether it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant under Guideline B:</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Although Applicant's wife and daughter are now U.S. citizens, DC 1 and 2 still both apply because his father-in-law and brother-in-law remain citizens and
residents of Ukraine. Applicant's wife's regular and frequent telephone contact with her father, her father's extended visit with them in the U.S., and their
recent travel to Ukraine to visit with her father and brother demonstrate the close ties of affection she has with her father and, to some extent, with her brother,
and Applicant's vicarious obligation to them. Applicant's recurring, although nominal, monetary assistance to his father-in-law, along with the recent
substantial financial contribution he made to provide his father-in-law with medical care, further demonstrate his sense of obligation to his wife's father. 
Applicant's ties of love and affection for his wife and daughter expose him to the potential for adverse influence or duress through her Ukrainian relatives.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Once the government meets its burden of proving controverted facts<A HREF="04-05077.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence demonstrating extenuation,
mitigation, or changed circumstances.<A HREF="04-05077.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  Further, the government is under no duty to present evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating
conditions, and an Administrative Judge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the government does not
present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.<A HREF="04-05077.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The following Mitigating Conditions (MC) must be evaluated in determining whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant under Guideline B: MC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters,
brothers, sisters), cohabitants, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that
could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the Untied States</EM>; and MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Contact and correspondence with foreign
citizens are casual and infrequent.</EM></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has not presented evidence sufficient to permit finding his in-laws are not in a position to be exploited by Ukraine. His wife's family members are
citizens and residents of Ukraine. Applicant, his wife and daughter traveled to Ukraine in 2005, and her father came to the U.S. on an extended visit in 2002/03.
Considering their recent past travel and her father's age and apparent medical condition, it is reasonable to expect that Applicant, his wife, and daughter will
travel to Ukraine in the future. The presence of Applicant's in-laws, and, likely in the future, Applicant, his wife and daughter, in Ukraine places them in the
position to be exploited by the Ukrainian government.<A HREF="04-05077.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In considering the possibility of exploitation by the Ukrainian government, I have also considered that Ukraine is a country in transition. While Ukraine is on its
way to becoming a stable democracy with a market economy that will be more closely integrated into European and Euro-Atlantic structures; it is also a country
that exhibits periodic internal instability, and that has acted as recently as 2000 contrary to the international interests of the United States. Accordingly, MC 1
does not apply. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As discussed above, Applicant's wife's contacts with her father are clearly indicative of the continuing close relationship she has with him. Her contact is
neither casual nor infrequent, and, accordingly, MC 3 does not apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearance eligibility decisions are determinations in terms of the national interest,</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">and are in no sense a determination of the loyalty of the applicant. There is no reason to question Applicant's or his wife's loyalty to the United States.
However, in all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern, and the ultimate question to be answered is whether it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified
information. Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on
its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Having done so, I am
unable to conclude that Applicant has presented sufficient evidence of refutation, extenuation, and mitigation to overcome the case against him. Accordingly,
Guideline B is decided against Applicant.    </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P>
