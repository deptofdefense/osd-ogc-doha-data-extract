</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 12 February 2004 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation 
of his clearance because of personal conduct and criminal conduct.<A HREF="02-24823.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant answered the SOR on 28 March 2004 and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned 
the case to me 19 July 2004 and I heard it 24 August 2004. DOHA received the transcript 1 September 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied the allegations of the SOR. He is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a 24-year-old computer technician employed by a defense contractor since March 2002. He has not 
previously had a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant applied for an industrial clearance in March 2002, he deliberately concealed his adverse employment record, criminal record, and drug abuse 
history between 1997 and August  2000 by answering "no" to questions 20 (adverse employment), 24 (alcohol/drug offenses), and 27 (illegal drug use). In fact, 
he had been fired from his job in May 1998 for stealing from his employer, arrested for possession of marijuana in August 2000, and used marijuana from 1997 
until his August 2000 arrest.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant has consistently denied any intent to mislead the government, he has given varied and inconsistent explanations for his omissions.<A HREF="02-24823.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
However, he acknowledged not being truthful on his application (Tr. 81) and not wanting his adverse conduct to be widely known (Tr. 36, 50). He did not 
contact the government investigator between completion of his application and his first interview in June 2002, and did not disclose his drug arrest until 
confronted with the information in a second interview in July 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The record is silent on h</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">is character or work performance. </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classif</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ied information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and Guideline J 
(Criminal Conduct).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="02-24823.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government established a Guideline E and J </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">case and Applicant did not mitigate the conduct. He deliberately concealed his drug use, theft in the workplace, 
and criminal conduct from the government.<A HREF="02-24823.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He has given varied and conflicting explanations for his conduct, but has acknowledged--and I conclude--he 
intended to conceal this information from both the government and his employer. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This conduct violated 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001.<A HREF="02-24823.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The underlying conduct also 
bespeaks poor judgment and untrustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's conduct demonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared personnel. The government has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse 
information about an Applicant before making a clearance decision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information. 
Further, an applicant's willingness to report adverse information about himself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security 
violations or other security concerns in the future, something the government relies on in order to perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of 
classified information. Applicant's conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government interests. I resolve Guideline E and J 
against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
