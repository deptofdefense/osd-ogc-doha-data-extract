<P>Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations.  He refuses to pay the debts because many of them will drop off his credit report in 2004.  He 
argues that if he makes any payments it will reactivate those debts on his credit report for another seven years.  Applicant's mother is a naturalized U.S. citizen 
who emigrated to the U.S. from South Korea.  Applicant's stepfather is a scientist who is a permanent resident of the U.S., but is a citizen of South Korea and 
travels there often.  Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations or foreign influence security concerns.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 29 August 2003, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-16696.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-16696.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 
29 September 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to another administrative judge, but was transferred to 
me on 12 November 2003.  On 11 December 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 31 December 2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is an angry young man-angry at his mother for marrying his stepfather (Tr. 17, 22-25) and angry at the Government for even suggesting that he could 
be a security risk (Tr. 38-41).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had a number of delinquent debts (&para;&para; 1.a.-1.j.) and made little effort to resolve his debts despite his income exceeding his 
expenses by almost $800 per month (&para; 1.k.).  An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
Directive &para; E2.A6.l.l.</P> 
 
<P>The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations contained in the SOR &para; 1.  Applicant has a history of 
not meeting his financial obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1) and is unable or unwilling to satisfy his debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3.).  Applicant's total debt is not large, but 
his attitude about paying these debts is troubling.  He understands that he still owes the money on charged off accounts that fall off his credit report.  
Nevertheless, he has adopted a strategy of not paying his bills so they will fall off his credit report.  He won't make payments on these accounts because the 
debt is then "just going to sit on my credit report and I have to live another seven years with it."  Tr. 26.  His purchase of a second vehicle instead of using the 
money to pay off his debts is symptomatic of his disregard for his creditors.  None of the mitigating conditions listed under the guideline apply to Applicant's 
case.  I find against Applicant on all subparagraphs except 1.a. and 1.j.  These subparagraphs allege minor debts Applicant paid.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline B-Foreign Influence</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's mother is a dual citizen of the U.S. and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) (&para; 2.a.) and his 
stepfather is a citizen of North Korea (&para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.b.).  A security risk may exist when members of an applicant's immediate family are not citizens of the U.S. or may 
be subject to duress.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government failed to establish Applicant's mother and stepfather are citizens of North Korea.  Applicant's mother is a citizen of the U.S. and his stepfather 
is a citizen of South Korea.  Evidently the Government's allegations are based on Applicant's statements in his security clearance application (SCA).  Ex. 1 at 
6-7.  Applicant  thought South Korea was the People's Democratic Republic of Korea instead of the Republic of Korea.  Nevertheless, Applicant's stepfather's 
citizenship and frequent travel to South Korea, sometimes with Applicant's mother, raises a security concern-an immediate family member (Applicant's 
mother) is sometimes present in a foreign country.  <EM>See </EM>DC E2.A2.1.2.1.  South Korea is placing a higher priority on collecting foreign high technology.  Ex. 7.  
Applicant's mother's marriage to a South Korean scientist and her many travels to South Korea, places her, and thus Applicant, in a vulnerable position.  
Applicant has not demonstrated that his mother is not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power or that any other mitigating condition applies.  I find 
against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
