<P>Fined $50 after being found in possession of marijuana in 1987, Applicant was again arrested on illegal drug charges in April 1988. Sentenced to 18 months in 
prison (suspended) for possession of a controlled dangerous substance and to one year (suspended) and probation for second controlled substance offense, he is 
statutorily disqualified from having a clearance granted or renewed under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. Applicant also falsified his April 2001 security clearance application 
by failing to list his illegal drug offenses. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On October 2, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-15750.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> DOHA recommended referral to an administrative judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be 
granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The SOR was based on Criminal Conduct (Guideline J) and Personal Conduct (Guideline E).</P> 
 
<P>On October 20, 2003, Applicant executed an Answer to the SOR, and requested a hearing  before a DOHA administrative judge if it would be in his best 
interests. The case was assigned to me on March 10, 2004, to conduct a hearing. Pursuant to formal notice of March 22, 2004, a hearing was held as scheduled 
on April 14, 2004. The Government submitted four exhibits that were entered in the record. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript received April 26, 
2004, and submitted nine exhibits. Originals of three additional documents were identified for the record with admission dependent on Applicant providing 
copies for the record after the hearing. On receipt of these documents on April 30, 2004, they were marked and entered into the record as Applicant exhibits J, 
K, and L.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The SOR alleges Criminal Conduct (Guideline J) concerns due to Applicant being fined in April 1987 for possession of marijuana and being convicted of an 
April 1988 possession of controlled substance, for which he was sentenced to 18 months incarceration (suspended) and fines, and of second controlled 
substance offense, for which he was sentenced to one year (suspended), fined, and placed on probation. Since he was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 
more than one year (albeit suspended) for the April 1988 illegal possession, Applicant was alleged to be disqualified from having a clearance granted or 
renewed under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 (commonly referred to as the "Smith Amendment").<A HREF="03-15750.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
<P> Personal Conduct (Guideline E) concerns were alleged as well because 
Applicant had not listed his drug offenses on his April 2001 security clearance application.  Applicant  admits his arrests and dispositions of charges as alleged. 
Those admissions are accepted and incorporated as findings of fact. He denies intentional falsification of his clearance application. After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 46-year-old shipfitter who has been employed by the same defense contractor since January 1980. He seeks a secret clearance for his defense-related duties.</P> 
 
<P>During the 1980s, Applicant abused alcohol and marijuana on weekends. While his use of alcohol impaired his judgment, and put him in circumstances where 
he should not have been, his involvement with marijuana was not limited to occasions when he was drinking with others.</P> 
 
<P>In April 1986, Applicant's spouse complained to the police that she wanted Applicant out of the house. Responding officers noted Applicant appeared to be 
intoxicated, and he was taken into custody on an active warrant for malicious damage. Applicant "snapped" while being jailed and struck his jailer in the head 
with an open handcuff, causing lacerations that required medical treatment for the jailer. Applicant was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon, a felony. 
Fear of losing his family led him to pursue alcohol rehabilitation, but he continued to drink alcohol and to use marijuana on occasion.</P> 
 
<P>In March 1987, trial of the felony assault charge led to a deadlocked jury. In late April 1987, Applicant pleaded nolo contendere to an amended charge of 
misdemeanor simple assault and his case was filed for one year.</P> 
 
<P>In mid-April 1987, Applicant smoked marijuana while hanging out with two others in the parking lot of a local drinking establishment after hours. Local police 
saw him put the drug in his pocket, and he was arrested for illegal possession. Applicant pleaded nolo contendere and was assessed $50 costs.</P> 
 
<P>In mid-April 1988, Applicant was snorting cocaine inside a local elementary school at 2:00  in the morning with a friend who was the night custodian at the 
school. Noting Applicant's car parked at the school, local police investigated and found Applicant and his friend with lines of cocaine before them on a table. 
Applicant was arrested for felony possession of a controlled dangerous substance (cocaine). A search of his vehicle incident to his arrest led to the discovery of 
a large quantity of marijuana and drug paraphernalia (scale, plastic bags), and a charge of second controlled substance offense (marijuana) was added. Rolling 
papers and a short straw were found on Applicant's person when he was searched in a police cell block. In November 1988, Applicant pleaded nolo contendere 
to both charges, was adjudged guilty as charged, and sentenced for cocaine possession to 18 months in prison, suspended, 18 months probation and costs, and 
for his second marijuana offense, to one year, suspended, one year probation and costs, sentences to run concurrently.<A HREF="03-15750.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
<P>Needing a security clearance for his duties, Applicant completed a handwritten security clearance application from which an electronic version was prepared on 
arch 23, 2001. Applicant signed this SF 86 on April 10, 2001, certifying that the statements on the form were true, complete, correct to the best of his 
knowledge, and made in good faith. Applicant did not disclose his criminal drug convictions or the 1986 felony assault charge on his SF 86, responding "NO" 
to question  21 concerning any felony offenses ["Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense?"] and to question 24 concerning any 
alcohol/drug offenses ["Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?"].</P> 
 
<P>In response to the Government's allegation that he deliberately falsified his SF 86 by not disclosing his drug offenses, Applicant indicated he answered "No" to 
both questions because he "thought [his] record was clean when the judge told [him] to get help, which [he] did get the help." At his hearing, Applicant testified 
with respect to the omission of his drug offenses that he wasn't sure he got convicted of any of the felony charges. (Tr. 41) He subsequently explained:</P> 
 
<P>The reasons I didn't write that down is I thought it meant being convicted, and I didn't think I had no convictions. I thought they were all suspended, or pulled 
from my file. I thought [the judge], the last time I had my problems, said, you know, if I clean up my act my record would be good. You know, I really 
understand that I screwed up, and I wish I at least mentioned it. (Tr. 72)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's denial of intentional omission is rejected as not credible. The express language in questions 21 and 24 is clear that information is to be reported 
regardless of whether the record has been sealed or otherwise stricken from the record.  Applicant also seriously undermined his claim of good faith by his less 
than forthright testimony at the hearing about his drug involvement. When asked by Department Counsel whether he continued to use drugs after his first arrest 
for possession of marijuana, Applicant responded, "I wasn't really, I didn't really do drugs, you know." Applicant attributed his drug use to his alcohol 
problem; he claimed to use drugs only when he was intoxicated. As to whether his use of drugs in the elementary school at 2:00 a.m. was a "crime of 
opportunity," Applicant responded, "I would say that, yes." (Tr. 36-37) When questioned later by the undersigned about his marijuana use, Applicant testified, 
"I just think my drinking really got me into places where I shouldn't have been." Asked then why he happened to have a quantity of marijuana in his vehicle on 
the occasion of his 1988 arrest, Applicant answered, "I really don't know. I really don't even know what they found in the vehicle myself." (Tr. 66) It stretches 
credulity that Applicant was unaware he had marijuana in his vehicle. The police found not only a quantity of marijuana in a brown bag, but also a scale and a 
box of plastic bags--paraphernalia consistent with drug sales. Applicant eventually admitted to the undersigned  he had been a user of marijuana, but he 
provided no explanation for the drug paraphernalia in his vehicle.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a highly skilled and motivated shipfitter who gives beyond what is expected to get the job done. Consistently rated as performing at fully 
satisfactory (the highest rating), Applicant received awards for outstanding achievement in December 2001, December 2002, July 2003, and November 2003.</P>

<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States 
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, 
discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations 
governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information." Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for 
a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability. <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</P> 
 
<P>Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15. An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</P>

<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to guidelines J and E:</P> 
 
<P>Having already pled nolo contendere to an April 1987 misdemeanor marijuana possession charge, Applicant was caught with cocaine inside  an elementary 
school and with a quantity of marijuana and drug paraphernalia in his vehicle in mid-April 1988. Adjudged guilty of felony possession of cocaine and 
possession of marijuana (second offense), Applicant was sentenced to a prison term of 18 months, suspended, on the cocaine count, and to one year, suspended, 
on the marijuana count. Criminal conduct disqualifying conditions a. <EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct</EM>, b. <EM>A single serious crime</EM>, and c. <EM>Any 
conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-marital of a crime where the person has been sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one 
year</EM>, apply in this case, even though Applicant served no jail time. Had he violated the terms of his probation, he could have spent up to 18 months in prison.</P> 
 
<P>The dated nature of the offenses and the absence of any recurrence are factors in his favor (<EM>see</EM> mitigating condition a. <EM>The criminal behavior was not recent),</EM> 
but Applicant is statutorily disqualified from having a security clearance granted or renewed under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. Criminal conduct punished by a term of 
incarceration in excess of one year is regarded as so serious to where it cannot be mitigated unless meritorious circumstances exist as determined by the 
Secretary of Defense (<EM>see</EM> MC g.).</P> 
 
<P>Furthermore, security significant Personal Conduct, Guideline E, concerns are raised where an applicant has not been completely candid with the Government 
about matter relevant and material to his or her personnel security application and investigation. (<EM>See</EM> DC E2.A5.1.2.2. <EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or 
falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct 
investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary 
responsibilities</EM>). The SF 86 signed by Applicant on April 10, 2001, bears negative responses to the inquiries concerning any felony charges or convictions and 
any alcohol or drug charges or convictions. His responses were found to be knowingly false; likely attributable to his desire for specific job opportunities that 
would be open to him if he had a clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Despite the passage of three years since the falsification of his SF 86, I am unable to conclude  he possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness that must be demanded of those granted access. He admitted to active involvement with marijuana (as opposed to being a few time user when 
his judgment was clouded by alcohol) late in the hearing after being confronted with the fact that the police found a quantity of marijuana in his vehicle. He has 
yet to explain his possession of drug paraphernalia (plastic bags and scale) associated with illegal drug sales. Although it has been 16 years since his arrest, it is 
simply not believable that he would not know that a bag of marijuana was found in his car and rolling papers were found on his person. Applicant having failed 
to meet his burden of showing he is successfully rehabilitated, adverse findings are warranted with respect to each allegation of the SOR. Pursuant to DOHA OI 
64 &para; 3.e.,<A HREF="03-15750.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN> it is not appropriate to make a recommendation as to whether his case should be considered further for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, given the 
unmitigated Personal Conduct and Criminal Conduct concerns.</P>
