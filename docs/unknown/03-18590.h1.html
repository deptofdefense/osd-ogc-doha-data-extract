<P>Applicant, who is now 46 years old, began using marijuana as an adolescent.  Her last use</P> 
<P>of marijuana occurred in approximately June 2004, at the age of 44.  She falsified her security clearance application by under-reporting her marijuana use and 
by not listing her most recent use because she did not want this information revealed to her employer.  Although Applicant states she will not use marijuana in 
the future because of its impact on her eligibility for a security clearance, she does not think marijuana is harmful, she speculates that many people who hold 
security clearances smoke marijuana, and she believes marijuana use should be legalized. Applicant's falsification of her drug use on her security clearance 
application and her illegal involvement with drugs raise serious security concerns.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On May 10, 2004, under the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="03-18590.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="03-18590.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns 
raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing June 4, 2004, and 
elected to have a decision without a hearing.  On February 11, 2005, Applicant requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to 
me on June 27, 2005.  On September 14, 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant.  The government introduced three exhibits (Ex.) which were marked as government's Ex. 1, 2, and 3, and received into 
evidence.  Applicant introduced one exhibit, which was marked as her Ex. A, and received into evidence. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding 
on September 27, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was not notified at least 15 days in advance of the time and place of her hearing, as required by &para; E 3.1.8. of Enclosure 3 of DoD Directive 5220.6.  
She was offered an opportunity to reschedule her hearing so that she would have a minimum of 15 days to prepare in advance for her hearing.  Upon due 
consideration, Applicant elected to waive the 15 day notice provision of the Directive and to proceed with her hearing.  She acknowledged that she understood 
that if she was not the prevailing party and was not granted a clearance, she would not be able to claim on appeal that she had received insufficient notice of 
hearing under the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains three allegations of disqualifying conduct.  Two allegations relate to conduct under Guideline H, Drug Involvement, and one allegation 
relates to conduct under Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the three allegations, adding explanatory information in 
two of her admissions.  Applicant's admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in 1959 and is now 46 years old.  She is single and works as a senior systems engineer for a government contractor.  She has worked for her 
present employer for approximately five years, and she supervises two other employees.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 35-36.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During her adolescence, Applicant used hashish two or three times and LSD once.  As a young adult she used cocaine once, and experienced no ill effects. (Ex. 
3, at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a long history of marijuana use. She began using marijuana in high school, and she used the drug monthly until she graduated from college in 
1981.  After college, she used marijuana monthly or less until September 1998.  (Ex. 3, at 1.)  Since 1998, she has used marijuana  occasionally.  (Ex. 3, at 1; 
Tr. 40-42.)  Her most recent use of marijuana occurred in approximately June 2004. (Tr. 41.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's employer asked her to complete a security clearance application (SF-86). Applicant was concerned about her employer learning about her marijuana 
use and hesitated in completing the SF-86.  She was afraid she might lose her job if her employer found out she used marijuana.  (Tr. 49-50.)  In November 
2002, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant complied with her employer's request and completed a security clearance application  (SF-86). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Question 27 on the SF-86 reads:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, 
hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants, (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, 
PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In response to Question 27, Applicant answered "yes" and indicated she had used marijuana five times from November 1995 to September 1998. (Ex. 1.)  On 
December 31, 2002, Applicant used marijuana.  In January 2003, Applicant's employer sent her an e-mail asking her to submit a signed copy of her SF-86.  
Applicant signed and certified her SF-86 on January 14, 2003, but did not report her use of marijuana on December 31, 2002.  (Tr. 30; Ex. A.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Security Service on May 14, 2003. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant admitted she had used marijuana four or five times 
since 1998 and that her last use of marijuana was December 31, 2002.  (Ex. 3, at 1.) She told the special agent she would likely use marijuana in the future. (Ex. 
3, at 2.)  At her hearing Applicant stated she had under-reported her marijuana use to the special agent and she stated she had in fact used marijuana after 
December 31, 2002.  (Ex. 3, at 1; Tr. 40-41.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At her hearing, Applicant stated her last use of marijuana occurred in approximately June 2004, after receiving the SOR from DOHA.  (Tr. 41.)  Applicant was 
granted an interim security clearance sometime after May 2003.  She is unsure whether she used marijuana after being granted the interim security clearance.  
(Tr. 50-51.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant stated she intended not to use marijuana in the future.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">She said she would use marijuana if there were no negative consequences, such as losing her 
job or a security clearance.  (Tr. 50.)  Applicant asserted she was hard-working and honorable and trustworthy.  (Answer to SOR; Ex. A.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a solitary person and seeks her own counsel.  She asserted she used marijuana for spiritual exploration and personal problem-solving.  She 
acknowledged being a social drinker of alcohol but was concerned about losing control when using alcohol.  (Tr. 43-44; 46)  Applicant believes marijuana is 
less harmful than alcohol and its use should be legalized.  (Tr. 44.)  She speculates that many people in high places in government use marijuana and many 
people who hold security clearances use marijuana.  (Tr. 44.)  She believes it is a waste of government resources to police the use of marijuana.  (Tr. 43-44.)</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  In 
evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The 
decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely an 
indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H - Drug Involvement</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from approximately 1974 or 1975, until at least January 
2003. (&para;&para; 1.a.); and that she expressed an intention to use marijuana in the future.  (&para; 1.b.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's concern with Guideline H conduct is that it raises questions regarding an individual's willingness to protect classified information.  Drug 
abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, thereby increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.  &para; 
E2.A8.1.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Drugs are defined under Guideline H as mood and behavior-altering substances, including drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed 
in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, and inhalants and other similar substances.  &para;&para; E2.A8.1.1.2., E2.A8.1.1.2.1., E2.A8.1.1.2.2.  Marijuana 
or cannabis listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and identified as a mood and behavior-altering substance under Guideline H.  Drug abuse is the 
illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.  &para; E2.A8.1.1.3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Through Applicant's own admissions, the Government established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case that she used marijuana, an illegal drug.  Applicant has admitted 
Guideline H drug involvement specified in the SOR and identified as disqualifying under &para;&para; E2.A8.1.2.1. of Guideline H.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record shows that Applicant's most recent drug involvement occurred in 2004.  Thus, her drug involvement was recent and mitigating condition 
E2.A8.1.3.1 does not apply.  Applicant's use of marijuana after receiving the SOR raises serious questions under E2.A8.1.1 regarding her willingness or ability 
to protect classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's involvement with drugs was neither isolated nor aberrational, for it occurred over a period of almost 30 years, from adolescence to her mid 40s. 
Thus, mitigating condition E2.A8.1.3.2. does not apply.  Applicant's assertions at her hearing that she intends not to use marijuana in the future must be 
weighed against her statements that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">she would consider future marijuana use if it would not jeopardize her job or her security clearance.  Additionally, 
Applicant's stated intent not to use marijuana should be evaluated in light of her assertions that she does not think marijuana is harmful, that many people who 
hold security clearances smoke marijuana, and marijuana use should be legalized.  Taken together, Applicant's statements do not demonstrate a credible and 
reliable intent not to use illegal drugs in the future, and, accordingly, E2.A8.1.3.3. does not apply to Applicant's case. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I have evaluated Applicant's drug 
involvement pursuant to the whole person concept.  I conclude the SOR allegations relating to Guideline H against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant raised concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, when she falsified material facts about her last use of marijuana  in 
her answer to Question 27 on her SF-86 (&para; 2.a.)  Guideline E conduct, which involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, could indicate an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; 
E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in the SOR, the Government has established its case.  The Government established, and Applicant admitted, 
that she concealed and falsified relevant and material facts in answering Question 27 on her personnel security questionnaire.  &para; E2.A5.1.2.2.  Her concealment 
of information she considered embarrassing or professionally damaging could make her vulnerable to coercion and blackmail.  &para;E2.A5.1.2.4.  Her conduct 
raises additional concerns under E2.A5.1.2.5. because it suggests a pattern of dishonesty or rule violation.  Applicant's reticence to reveal the truth about her 
conduct suggests that, under some circumstances, she may put her interests before those of the Government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At her hearing, Applicant admitted under-reporting her episodes of drug use between 1998 and December 2002 in her interview with a special agent of the 
Defense Security Service, conduct which raises a security concern under &para; E2.A5.1.2.3. She also admitted using marijuana several times between December 
2002 and June 2004.  She stated her last use of marijuana occurred after receiving the SOR from DOHA.  These admissions raise additional concerns about 
Applicant's credibility and security worthiness. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating condition E2.A5.1.3.1 does not apply to the facts of this case.  The information Applicant withheld is pertinent to a determination of her judgment, 
trustworthiness, and reliability.  Only one other mitigating condition under Guideline E might be applicable to the instant case.  The security concern raised by 
Applicant's disqualifying conduct could be mitigated if the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and if the Applicant subsequently provided the 
correct information voluntarily.  &para;E.2.A.5.1.3.2.  Applicant provided some correct information when confronted by an investigator of the Defense Security 
Service in May 2003.  However, she also provided false information to the investigator in her signed, sworn statement, thereby demonstrating  on-going 
falsification and lack of candor.  Applicant's disqualifying personal conduct is recent and not isolated.  Accordingly, the allegation in subparagraph 2.a. of the 
SOR is concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
