<P>Applicant  was twice convicted of theft-related offenses (one in 1986 and the other in 1999) and was sentenced to more than a year on his most recent offense,  
suspended, and placed on probation for two years, subject to compliance with his two year probation conditions.  Applicant's actions raise judgment and 
trustworthiness concerns.  His mitigation efforts, while encouraging, are insufficient at this time to mitigate the Government's security concerns.  Clearance is 
denied. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 27, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance, and recommended referral 
to an administrative judge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on June 18, 2004, and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant received the File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) on November 29, 2004 and timely responded to the FORM, although not detected until April 25, 2005. The case was assigned to me 
August 24, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested in June 1998 for theft of property (2d degree felony), to which he pleaded guilty in July 1998, and 
was placed in a theft diversion program.  Applicant is alleged to have failed to complete the program in July 1998, pleaded guilty to a theft charge in January 
1999 and was sentenced to one year and one day of incarceration (suspended), placed on two years probation, fined $250.00 and required to perform 100 hours 
of community service.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Additionally, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested in January 1986 for larceny of property (3d degree misdemeanor) and fined.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted his 1986 and 1998 arrests but denied failing to complete the theft diversion program.  He claimed to have been 
given a damaged plant holder by the charity he was assigned to work with by the court following his initial admission of guilt in July 1998 and was not aware 
he failed to complete the theft diversion program until he checked his police records.  Appellant denied stealing any property in connection with his January 
1986 arrest for which he was fined.  He claimed to have been scared by his arrest and only agreed to pay the fine on the advice of a police official.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government moved to amend the SOR to delete the alleged application of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 986 (the Smith Amendment) in sub-paragraph 1.c to Applicant's 
situation for the cited reason that the Smith Amendment has since been revised to apply only to situations where the charged serves more than a year in 
confinement.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By its enactment of the Smith Amendment (10 U.S.C. Sec. 986(c)(1)) in 2001, Congress created a mandatory security clearance bar to any person who, <EM>inter 
alia</EM>, who has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding a year.   In 2004, Congress 
revised the pertinent Smith Amendment provision barring persons from holding a security clearance who have been convicted of a crime and sentenced to more 
than a year of imprisonment by adding a requirement of actual imprisonment for more than a year.  The 2004 change to the Smith Amendment is contained in 
Section 1071 of  Title 10 (<EM>referred to as the Ronald W. Reagan Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005</EM>).  There being no objection to the 
Government's amendment motion, and good cause being shown, the Government's amendment was granted. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Within the time permitted to supplement the record, Applicant supplemented the record to add character references.  The references were not objected to by the 
Government and are admitted as Item 10.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 39-year-old quality assurance administrator for a defense contractors who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and 
admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested in January 1986 for stealing a cable connector (estimated cost $100.00) from a retail store.  Being young and afraid of his mother finding 
out, he paid a fine, which avoided his having to appear in court.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In June 1998, Applicant was arrested for larceny in a retail store after being observed by a security personnel official stuffing a suit (valued at $425.00) in a bag 
and exiting the store.  After spending a night in the city jail, he was charged with theft (a second degree felony).  At his hearing before a local district judge, he 
admitted the theft charge and was placed in a theft diversion program and required to complete 200 hours of community service as a condition of his probation 
(s<EM>ee</EM> item 9).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While performing his community service with a Christmas charity, Applicant noticed that the charity operators were about to throw away a damaged plant 
holder.  He claims he was told that since the plant holder was to be thrown away he could have it (<EM>see </EM>item 7).  Soon after he exited the store with the stand in 
his possession, he received a call from the district attorney's office and was told not to call the charity any more.  The charity complained  it was harassed by 
Applicant.  Although there are no documented accounts from the charity as to whether Applicant lacked permission to take the plant holder,  he was required to 
appear in the circuit court and enter a plea to the original theft charges filed in the district court (<EM>see</EM> item 9).  Applicant, in turn, filed an application in 
November 1998 to plead guilty to the original charges and did, in fact, plead guilty to the theft charges (a second degree felony) in January 1999.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Accepting Appellant's plea agreement with the district attorney at a January 1999 hearing, the circuit court this time sentenced Applicant to one year and one 
day of incarceration (suspended), placed hin on two years probation, fined him $250.00, ordered him to pay a victim's compensation fund the sum of $100.00, 
and ordered him to complete 100 hours of community service as a condition of his probation (<EM>see</EM> item 9). Applicant's accepted plea by the circuit court reflects 
a considered probation violation and warrants inferences the court did not accept any of Applicant claims of misunderstanding with the Christmas charity store 
operators.  So, even though Applicant was not prosecuted for taking a old plant holder from the charity he briefly worked for, his inferred actions of taking the 
plant stand without clear permission represents an act of larceny totally separate from his earlier theft offense.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed his two years of probation and fully complied with the court's other conditions (<EM>i.e., </EM>payment of a $250.00 fine, payment of $100.00 into a 
victim's compensation fund, and completion of 100 hours of community service).  He has been involved in no other documented incidents (<EM>see</EM> item 7).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is well regarded by his operations manager, pastor, and fellow community volunteer, as a person who has shown leadership abilities, dedication, 
courage and integrity.  Although, none of Applicant's supporters indicate any familiarity with the underlying allegations of the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance 
and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from 
the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a meritorious quality assurance administrator who has been involved in two theft-related incidents over the past 20 years: one resulting in a 
misdemeanor theft conviction in 1986 and the other resulting in a felony theft conviction and a suspended sentence of more than a year following a probation 
violation and an ensuing Applicant plea agreement with the local district attorney in January 1999.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since completing his two-years of probation, Applicant has not been involved in any other criminal activity. While Applicant seems to be a good role model in 
his work and community, he has had only four years to demonstrate learned lessons in judgment and trustworthiness outside the workplace.  Because 
Applicant's situation reflects both recurrent and relatively recent criminal conduct, security concerns are raised under the Adjudicative Guidelines for criminal 
conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's two convictions warrant the application of two disqualifying conditions of the  Adjudicative Guidelines for criminal conduct: DC E2.A.10.1.2.1 
(<EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>) and DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>A single serious crime or 
multiple lesser offenses</EM>).  Applicant's two theft-related convictions reflect pattern activity even though they are separated by 13 years of elapsed time without 
another reported incident.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant's underlying actions leading to his 1986 and 1999 theft convictions warrant some consideration of three of the mitigating conditions of the 
guidelines for criminal conduct, <EM>i.e.,</EM> MC E2.A10.1.3.1 (<EM>The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>), MC E2.A10.1.3.2 (<EM>The criminal behavior was an isolated 
incident</EM>), and MC E2.A10.1.3.6 (<EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>), as well as the E2.2.2 factors, favorable application of these conditions 
and factors is not fully warranted. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's satisfaction of his probation conditions and his demonstrated showing of reliability and trust within his work and community reflect positively on 
his character.  His imputed judgment and trust lapses reflected in these earlier theft convictions are still too recent, though, to be considered sufficiently 
mitigated to entitle him to the renewed level of trusted judgment and reliability necessary to afford him access to classified information.  Taking into account all 
of the facts and circumstances developed in the record, unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b of 
the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of the FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the 
factors listed above, this Administrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">GUIDELINE J: (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):   AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Sub-para. 1.a:      AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Sub-para. 1.b:      AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security 
clearance.   Clearance is denied.      </SPAN></P>
