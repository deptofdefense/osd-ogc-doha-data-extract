<P>Applicant is 53 years old, and a technician working for a defense contractor.  He was arrested in 1993 for driving while impaired with a BAC of .14%.  In 2004 he was arrested for the same offense.  
Earlier in 2004 he was arrested for having an open container of beer in the passenger compartment of his car as he drove home after work one night.  Applicant has not mitigated the alcohol 
consumption and criminal conduct security concerns.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On October 20, 2005, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons<A HREF="05-04310.red.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing 
the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on November 
8, 2005, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on February 8, 2006.  On April 27, 2006, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  DOHA received the 
hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 9, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence, I 
make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 53 years old, divorced, and has one child.  He works for a defense contractor as a lead technician.  He has worked for this employer since 1979, and now works on the second shift from 2 
p.m. to 10:30 p.m. daily.  Applicant likes to fish and build model boats in his spare time. (Tr. 24, 29, 32, 39, 41; Exhibits 1, 3, A)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was arrested in October 1993 for driving while impaired.  His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .14%.  He pled guilty, paid a $650 fine, and had his driver's license suspended for 90 days.  
Applicant was drinking beer when he was arrested for this incident.  After this arrest, Applicant resumed his drinking pattern of a beer every day. (Tr. 19, 20, 32; Answer)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was arrested on March 26, 2004, near his home for having an open container of alcohol, a can of beer, in his car as he drove home from work about 11 p.m.  He had stopped at a convenience 
store, purchased the 16 ounce can of beer, and opened it in the parking lot and drank from while driving home.  The police stopped Applicant, gave him a citation, and dumped the beer out.  Applicant 
pled guilty, and paid a $175 fine. (Tr. 17, 18, 32-34; Exhibit 2, Answer)</P> 
 
<P>In July 2004, Applicant was arrested for driving while impaired.  His BAC was .14%.  He pled guilty to this charge on September 9, 2004.  His sentence was 10 months of probation, required to attend 
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings three times a week, submit to random drug screens, serve five days of community service, pay fines and court costs, attend a victim's panel session, and 
outpatient counseling.  He completed all these requirements in September 2005.  His probation ended early in July 2005. (Tr. 14, 15, 20, 23, 34-36; Exhibit 3, Answer)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant entered the outpatient treatment program in September 16, 2004, and successfully completed the program on November 10, 2004.  He entered the program with a diagnosis of "Alcohol Abuse 
(Mild)".  Further treatment was not recommended by the substance abuse therapist, who also stated "a very good prognosis is available for a future free of further alcohol related social problems."  
Applicant watched video cassettes in the counseling sessions, and discussed them with the therapist.  The therapist did not give Applicant any recommendations for his future alcohol use. After 
attending AA as required by the probation program, Applicant ceased his participation in August 2005 when he went to another state on assignment for his employer.   While there, he drank with his co-workers at dinner, but he also claimed "I didn't go out in" that town.  When he returned home he did not resume AA.  Applicant did not drink alcohol while on probation, and claims to be abstinent 
since January 2006.  Applicant has not had any alcohol related arrests or incidents since July 2004. (Tr. 20-23, 28, 35-38, 43, 46; Exhibits 3, 4, Answer)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant consumed alcohol at times to excess and to the point of intoxication from 1993 to July 2004.  He started drinking when he was 21, in about 1973.  On October 7, 2005, Applicant answered 
DOHA interrogatories by stating he currently drank alcoholic beverages, having two to three beers on weekends, and he last had a beer on October 2, 2005.  Applicant answered the SOR in November 
2005 stating, in part, that "he no longer drinks any alcoholic beverages."  Now he claims he has not consumed alcoholic beverages since January 2006.  Applicant claims he does not have any alcohol in 
his home now.  He claims he made a conscious effort to abstain from alcohol, and only drinks water and soft drinks now.  His employer does not know about his three arrests for alcohol related 
incidents. (Tr. 26, 29, 30, 37, 38, 42, 44; Exhibit 3, Answer) </P> 
 
<P>Applicant stated at the hearing that he had never been investigated or charged with any crime or misdemeanor not discussed at the hearing.  The security clearance application (SCA), completed on 
January 15, 2004, lists a 1976 assault that was dismissed after probation.  Applicant also listed on the SCA a 1995 driving while impaired arrest, but may have meant the 1993 arrest.  The March 2004 
and July 2004 arrests occurred after the SCA was completed and submitted to the Government. (Tr. 23, 24, 27; Exhibit 1)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant submitted a character reference letter from a supervisor at his company.  Applicant is considered to have made "bountiful and unique" contributions to the company.  He is regarded as having 
a great work ethic.  His supervisor regards him as striving for excellence in his performance.  Applicant has had no disciplinary problems at work.  Nor has he had any work related problems from 
alcohol. (Tr. 25, 26; Exhibit A)</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the national interest to 
do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information with Industry</EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960)<EM>. </EM> Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of 
demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common sense determination required.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the nature, 
extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's 
age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). Because each security case presents its 
own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse 
information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of 
questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not 
met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's 
security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified 
information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No. 00-0277, 2001 
DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive &para; 
E2.2.2.  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption: <EM>The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk 
of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. E2.A7.1.1</EM></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J: Criminal Conduct: <EM>The Concern: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness</EM>. E2.A10.1.1</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations in the SOR.  Based on my consideration of all of the evidence in the record, I make the 
conclusions that follow regarding both security concerns.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The alcohol consumption Disqualifying Conditions (DC) that could raise a security concern are ; DC 1 (Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence or while 
impaired, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use. E2.A7.1.2.1); and DC 5 (Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment. E2.A7.1.2.5).  He has three alcohol 
induced incidents since 1993.  Two incidents occurred after he completed his SCA, on which he answered a question about his 1993 incident putting him on notice of the gov interest in alcohol-related 
incidents.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No Mitigating Conditions (MC) apply to Applicant's case.  His arrests show a recent pattern of alcohol consumption and the operation of a motor vehicle.  His uncorroborated statement about his 
current abstention is not persuasive, especially viewed in the context of his drinking history.  His AA participation was motivated not by his desire to stop drinking but was compelled by court order.  
When he no longer was required to attend, he stopped and resumed his drinking the following month.  Based on these facts, I see no positive changes or commitment to sobriety, nor an understanding of 
the severity of his actions in view of his drinking history.  Although he submitted evidence of some form of alcohol education program participation, he has not exhibited sufficient evidence of 
mitigating his alcohol propensities.  In view of the incidents that occurred while his security clearance was pending, his evidence is not persuasively mitigating.  I was not persuaded by his inconsistent 
statements on when he ceased drinking in late 2005, and then at the hearing Applicant asserts he stopped drinking in January 2006.  His credibility is diminished substantially by these different 
statements.  Therefore, I conclude the alcohol consumption security concern against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The criminal conduct security concerns are: DC 1 (Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged. E2.A10.1.2.1); and DC 2 (A single serious 
crime or multiple lesser crimes. E2.A10.1.2.2).  Applicant has three alcohol related arrests, involving his automobile, two for driving while impaired with BAC of .14%, and one for drinking while 
driving home.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There are no MC applicable here either.  Two incidents occurred after Applicant completed his SCA and therefore are recent.  Three incidents are not isolated, particularly the last two.  Applicant 
voluntarily committed all the actions, was not acquitted of any charge but pled guilty each time, and there is no clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.  Therefore, I conclude this security concern 
against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I considered Applicant's age of 51 and maturity at the time the latest two incidents occurred, the seriousness of the alcohol offenses 
and their surrounding circumstances, the proximity of each incident to the other, his inclination to drink while driving after work, his credibility during the hearing, the significant BAC of .14% in the 
1993 and 2004 incidents, and the likelihood that the conduct will recur in the future.  I weighed this evidence in the context of the whole person concept, and found Applicant did not mitigate the 
security concerns.  For all these reasons, I conclude the Guideline G and J security concerns against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:</SPAN></P>
