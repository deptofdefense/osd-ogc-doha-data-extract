<P>Applicant has a decades-long history of criminal conduct consisting of arrests and convictions for alcohol-related offenses and other offenses. He gave two false answers about his police record when he 
completed a security-clearance application in June 2005. He failed to present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns stemming from these matters. Clearance is 
denied.   </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is challenging the Defense Department's preliminary decision to deny or revoke his eligibility for a security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> on 
April 6, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR--which is in essence the administrative 
complaint--alleges security concerns under Guideline G for alcohol consumption, Guideline J for criminal conduct, and Guideline E for personal conduct (falsification). In a response dated May 8, 
2006, Applicant replied to the SOR and indicated he did not wish to have a hearing. On June 22, 2006, department counsel submitted his written case consisting of all relevant  and material information 
that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant and it was received by him on July 31, 2006. Applicant submitted  additional documentary 
information within the 30-day period after receiving the FORM. The case was assigned to me September 18, 2006. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits many of the factual allegations in the SOR and his admissions will be discussed below. In addition, I make the following findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P>1. Applicant is a 50-year-old man who is employed as a site rodbuster. He has worked for his current employer since June 2005. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance for his employment with a 
federal contractor. Before his current job, Applicant has been employed for many years doing concrete and carpenter work.  </P> 
 
<P>2. His security-clearance application indicates he has never married. But other information in the FORM indicates he has been married for many years and has a child.</P> 
 
<P>3. Applicant has a history of criminal conduct from about 1976 to about 2005. His offenses  primarily involve alcohol-related incidents, such as driving while intoxicated (DWI). In his eight-page 
response to the SOR, Applicant addressed his alcohol consumption and criminal record, and he admitted the following alcohol-related incidents:</P> 
 
<UL> 
  <LI>Arrested and charged with DWI in 1976.</LI> 
  <LI>Arrested, charged, and convicted of DWI in 1978.</LI> 
  <LI>Arrested and charged with DWI in 1980.</LI> 
  <LI>Arrested and charged with DWI and leaving the scene of an accident in 1981.</LI> 
  <LI>Arrested and charged with DWI on two occasions in March 1982.</LI> 
  <LI>Arrested, charged, and convicted of DWI in August 1982.</LI> 
  <LI>Arrested, charged, and convicted of DWI, speeding, driving with a license, traffic lane violation, and false report in October 1982.</LI> 
  <LI>Arrested and charged with DWI, driving with a suspended or revoked license, and two traffic offenses in March 1985. Convicted of DWI and the other matters were dismissed.</LI> 
  <LI>Arrested and charged with open container, DWI, and failure to maintain lane in 1994. The charges were <EM>nolle prossed</EM>. </LI> 
  <LI>Arrested, charged, and convicted of DWI in March 1997. </LI> 
  <LI>Arrested and charged with DWI and child abuse in June 1997.</LI> 
  <LI>Received counseling for alcohol use in 1998.</LI> 
  <LI>Arrested and charged with aggravated DWI and a traffic offense in 1999. Both charges were dismissed.</LI> 
  <LI>Arrested and charged with aggravated DWI and a traffic offense in 2001. Convicted of DWI.</LI> 
  <LI>Arrested and charged with battery-domestic violence in 2005. Denies being convicted, but the record evidence (Exhibit 12) proves otherwise. </LI> 
 
 
<P>4. In addition to his alcohol-related incidents, Applicant admitted the following:</P> 
 
<UL> 
  <LI>Arrested and charged with possession of hashish in 1977.</LI> 
  <LI>Arrested and charged with interference in 1978.</LI> 
  <LI>Arrested and charged with obstructing traffic in 1981.</LI> 
  <LI>Arrested and charged with disorderly conduct in 1982.</LI> 
  <LI>Arrested, charged, and convicted of driving on a suspended license, unlawful alter/forging a driver's license, and a traffic offense in 1986.</LI> 
  <LI>Arrested, charged, and convicted of battery-domestic violence in 1989.</LI> 
 
 
<P>Also, Applicant was arrested, charged, and convicted for failure to appear in connection with the 2005 battery-domestic violence case. He has served jail time (never more than one year) on several 
occasions. </P> 
 
<P>5. In June 2005, Applicant completed a security-clearance application for his employer. In completing the application, he was required to truthfully answer questions about his background. The SOR 
alleges that Applicant gave deliberately false answers to two questions. Each is discussed below. </P> 
 
<P>6.  In response to Question 23,<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> he answered "no" and did not report the 2005 battery-domestic violence offense that was then pending. In response to Question 24,<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> he answered "yes" and reported a 
single DWI offense from 2002. He did not report any of the other DWI charges and convictions detailed above. </P> 
 
<P>7. In his response to the FORM, Applicant submitted a letter of recommendation, a court record concerning his alcohol treatment, and a newspaper article. In the letter of recommendation, his project 
engineer for about four months gives Applicant a strong recommendation based on his hard work and taking the initiative to get the job done. The court record reflects Applicant received alcohol 
treatment in December 2005 for 28 days. The comments and recommendations include the following: (1) Applicant did well concerning assignments and got along well with peers and staff; (2) he was 
advised to avoid substance use in the future; (3) he was referred to 12-step programs for follow-up and support of an abstinent lifestyle; (4) he was encouraged to complete his education and develop 
hobbies to occupy his free time; and (5) it was noted he is quite sociable and amicable when he wants to be and when he is sober. There is no mention of either a diagnosis or prognosis. The newspaper 
article was a feature article about Applicant's abilities as an artist and it reported that he won the best of show award at a local county fair. The article notes that Applicant's art career includes stone 
carving, painting, and jewelry making. Also,  the article notes that Applicant has had a long rodeo career as a bronco rider.  </P> 
 
<P>8. In his written response to the FORM, Applicant asserts that he was grown as a person, respects his country, and would never do anything to harm it. Also, he admits making mistakes in his past and 
points out that he has paid for his mistakes. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each 
guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and 
adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept.<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government must be able to have a 
high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant's 
loyalty.<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> There is no presumption in 
favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been

the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one has a right to a security clearance.<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> And as noted by the Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN> </CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>1. The Alcohol Consumption Security Concern</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline G,<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> a history of excessive alcohol consumption raises a security concern because of the potential for deliberate or inadvertent  mishandling of classified information due to 
intoxication. The concern is that excessive consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure 
of classified information due to carelessness.</P> 
 
<P>Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline G. The record evidence is clear--Applicant has a history of excessive alcohol consumption resulting 
in numerous arrests and convictions for alcohol-related incidents, mostly DWI offenses. His multiple arrests and convictions for DWI are of special concern because his repetitive conduct indicates a 
tendency toward reckless behavior or an unwillingness to comply with the law. </P> 
 
<P>Given the facts here,  DC 1<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>--alcohol-related incidents away from work--applies against Applicant. The record evidence is filled with incidents or allegations of criminal conduct directly related to 
Applicant's alcohol use.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I reviewed the MC under the guideline and conclude none apply. Applicant has not presented a persuasive case that his alcohol-related incidents are a thing of the past. What's needed here is a long-term 
period of abstinence along with a long-term period of no further alcohol-related incidents. At this point, it is too soon to tell if Applicant will follow through and be able to maintain a sober lifestyle. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>2. The Criminal Conduct Security Concern </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline J,<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> criminal conduct is a concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling sensitive information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, a security concern is raised under Guideline J. The record evidence shows Applicant has a history or pattern of criminal conduct over many years. He has 
numerous arrests, several convictions, and has served jail time. Given these facts and circumstances, both DC 1<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> and DC 2<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> apply against Applicant. His history of criminal conduct creates doubt 
about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I reviewed the MC under the guideline and conclude none apply. Applicant has not presented a persuasive case that his history of criminal conduct is a thing of the past unlikely to recur.  At this point, it 
is too soon to tell if Applicant will follow through and be a law-abiding citizen. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>3. The Personal Conduct Security Concern</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct under Guideline E<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> is always a security concern because it asks the<STRONG> </STRONG>central question: Does a person's past conduct justify confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard 
classified information. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security clearance or in other 
official matters is a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully. </P> 
 
<P>An omission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the information 
did not need to be reported. </P> 
 
<P>Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, a security concern is raised under Guideline E. The record evidence shows Applicant deliberately provided false answers to Questions 23 and 24 
concerning his pending offense and his alcohol-related offenses.<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> Applicant was required to give full, frank, and truthful answers to these questions and it's plainly obviously that he did not. His false 
answers in response to two questions on his security-clearance application show questionable judgment, lack of candor, unreliability, and untrustworthiness. </P> 
 
<P>I reviewed the MC under the guideline and conclude none apply. Making false statements during the security-clearance process is a serious matter, not easily explained away, extenuated, or mitigated. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>4. The Whole-Person Concept</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I considered the available information in light of the whole-person concept. Applicant is now a 50-year-old man and was a mature adult when most of his alcohol-related troubles took place.<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> In other 
words, he was old enough to know better. His has an extensive history of criminal conduct (mostly alcohol-related offenses), and his last conviction was in 2005.<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> His overall situation appears to be a 
firmly ingrained pattern of behavior that is likely to recur. Also, he did not present a persuasive case that his alcohol-related troubles are behind him and what steps and actions he is doing to accomplish 
this task<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> More troubling, however, are his false answers on his June 2005 security-clearance application, which are serious matters as well as constituting criminal conduct under federal law.<A HREF="05-09433.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> 
Considering the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns arising under  Guidelines G, J, and E. 
And he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  </P>
