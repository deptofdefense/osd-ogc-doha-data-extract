  Operating Instruction does not authorize Board to review an Administrative Judge's recommendation whether or not a waiver under 10 U.S.C. 986 should be considered.  Under Operating Instruction, Board is not authorized to give reasons or explanation for its decision to recommend or not recommend that  a waiver be considered.  Since the Board is asked to make a recommendation in its own capacity, Board is not bound by the recommendation made by the Judge  below and must review the record evidence as a whole in order to fulfill its obligation to make a meaningful decision whether to recommend or not recommend  that a waiver should be considered.  Adverse decision affirmed.  Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Adam L. Birbrower, Esq.</SPAN></P> 
<P>Administrative Judge Kathryn Moen Braeman issued a decision, dated March 11, 2002, in which she concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.</P> 
<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 as 
amended.</P> 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the issue of whether the Appeal Board recommends that  Applicant's case be considered for a waiver of the statutory provisions 
under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  For the reasons set forth below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision, and does not recommend consideration of this 
case for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated September 13, 2001.  The SOR was based on Guideline J 
(Criminal Conduct).</P> 
<P>Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR, in which she exercised her option to have a hearing in her case before an Administrative Judge.  The hearing was 
held on January 18, 2002.  The Judge issued a written decision, dated March 11, 2002 in which she concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from the Judge's adverse decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See </EM>Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 
2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly 
detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See </EM>DISCR Case No. 
87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>This appeal presents the Board with legal issues concerning the adjudication of industrial security cases covered by 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  Applicant submitted an 
appeal brief.  Department Counsel did not submit a reply brief.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER">I. Administrative Judge's Decision</P> 
<P>The Administrative Judge found: (1) Applicant was arrested in April 1981 for knowingly and intentionally conspiring to import substantial quantities of cocaine 
into the United States in violation of federal law; (2) She had accompanied her husband while he trafficked in cocaine from April 1979 to January 1981; (3) 
Applicant was convicted of aiding and abetting and sentenced to eighteen months confinement, all of which was suspended, and given 5 years probation; (4) In 
1986 Applicant violated the terms of her probation by using marijuana once a week; (5) She was ordered to serve her original sentence of eighteen months and 
three years Special Parole Term; (6) She served nine months in confinement and five months in a halfway house; (7) She successfully completed her parole in 
September 1988 and attended a Narcotics Anonymous program which required her to get a job; (8) Applicant obtained a job with a defense contractor in May 
1988 where she has continuously worked in increasingly responsible positions; (9) Since 1986 she has not used drugs and she has no future intent to use drugs; 
(10) She was promoted to a supervisory position in 1996;  (11) A past supervisor, current supervisor, a co-worker and a friend all relate that Applicant is  
trustworthy, conscientious, and very knowledgeable in her field; (12) None of Applicant's character references have seen her use drugs; and (13) She was 
granted a Department of Defense Secret clearance in 1997.</P> 
<P>The Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant's criminal conduct might now be mitigated because the behavior was not recent, there is no evidence that 
she has subsequently been involved with any criminal or drug activity, the factors leading to her criminal law violation are not likely to recur and there is clear 
evidence of successful rehabilitation.  The Administrative Judge ultimately found against Applicant, however, on the specific SOR allegation citing her past 
criminal conduct under the standard provisions of Guideline J.  The Administrative Judge also found against Applicant under a separate SOR allegation citing 
the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  The Judge also recommended that Applicant's case be considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P> 
<P><CENTER>II. Applicant's Appeal Argument</CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant does not challenge the Administrative Judge's conclusion that her case is covered by the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, which precludes the 
Department of Defense from granting or continuing a security clearance for persons who fall under any of four statutory categories.  However, </P> 
<P>Applicant asks that she be granted a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 for the following reasons: (1) Applicant's criminal activity was neither frequent nor recent as 
her conviction occurred over twenty years ago, and although she violated her probation in 1986, she has stayed out of trouble for more than fifteen years; (2) 
She is now a 47-year-old mature, reformed adult; (3) Applicant lacks criminal motivation as her past criminal activity was not willful and arguably was not 
voluntary as evidenced by physical and mental abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband who coerced her into criminal participation by threatening 
physical and mental abuse; (4) Applicant has been fully rehabilitated as evidenced by her successful completion of drug treatment and parole, her exemplary job 
performance in positions of increasing responsibility since 1988, and the favorable evaluation of her trustworthiness by others who have testified on her behalf; 
and (5) Applicant's criminal activity ended with her probation violation in 1986, has not continued and will not recur as her criminal activity was intimately 
involved with her marriage to her husband from whom she is now divorced and has no contact.  Applicant also discusses the Guideline J mitigating conditions 
in her appeal brief.  The Board construes Applicant's discussion of those mitigating conditions as laying out additional reasons in support of her request for a 
waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P> 
<P><CENTER>II. Scope of Board's authority under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986</CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, the Department of Defense may not grant or renew a security clearance for a defense contractor official or employee that falls under any 
of four statutory categories [10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1) through (c)(4)].  Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d), the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the military 
department concerned may authorize an exception to the statutory prohibition against granting or renewing a security clearance for cases covered by 10 
U.S.C.&sect;986(c)(1) or 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(4).</P> 
<P>In a June 7, 2001 memorandum implementing the provisions of 10 U.S.C.&sect;986, the Deputy Secretary of Defense indicated: "The decision as to whether a 
particular case involves a meritorious case that would justify pursuing a request for waiver shall be the province of the DoD Component concerned (i.e. all 
Components authorized to grant, deny or revoke access to classified information) beginning with the Director of the Component Central Adjudication Facility 
(CAF), the Component appellate authority or other appropriate senior Component official."  For purposes of the June 7, 2001 memorandum, Director, DOHA is 
the Director of the Component's Central Adjudication Facility for industrial security clearance cases.</P> 
<P>To implement the June 7, 2001 memorandum, the Director, DOHA issued an operating instruction (dated July 10, 2001) which indicates the following:</P> 
<P>"Administrative Judges are responsible for initial resolution as to whether or not 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of the case."  (Operating Instruction, 
paragraph 2.e.)</P> 
<P>"In the event of an appeal raising an issue as to the applicability of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board is responsible for final resolution of the issue."  (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 2.f.)</P> 
<P>"In the event of a final determination that 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of a case, the Director is solely responsible for the discretionary decision as to 
whether to recommend to the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) that 10 U.S.C. 986 should be waived by the Secretary of Defense."  (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 2.g.)</P> 
<P>"If an Administrative Judge issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Administrative Judge shall include 
without explanation either the statement 'I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'I do not recommend further 
consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'"</P> 
<P>(Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.e.)</P> 
<P>"If the Appeal Board issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board shall include without explanation 
either the statement 'The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or "The Appeal Board does not recommend 
consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'" (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.f.)</P> 
<P>"In any case in which the Administrative Judge, or the Appeal Board in the event of an appeal, recommends consideration of a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986, the 
Director shall within his sole discretion determine whether or not to forward the case to the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) for further consideration 
of a possible waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986 by the Secretary of Defense together with such rationale as may be requested by the Deputy General Counsel (Legal 
Counsel)."  (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.g.)</P> 
<P>Because Applicant does not dispute the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 to her case, all that remains for the Board to do is consider her request that it 
recommend further consideration of her case for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).  Such a request, however, places the Board in an unusual situation.  The 
Operating Instruction does not authorize the Board to review and Administrative Judge's recommendation whether or not a waiver should be considered.  
Furthermore, under the Operating Instruction, the Board is not authorized to give reasons or an explanation for its decision to recommend or not recommend 
that a waiver be considered, but is authorized only to state without explanation either: (1) "The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for a 
waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986" or (2) "The Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986."  Since the Board is asked to 
make a recommendation in its own capacity, the Board is not bound by the recommendation made by the Judge below and must review the record evidence as a 
whole in order to fulfill its obligation to make a meaningful decision whether to recommend or not that a waiver should be considered. </P> 
<P>   </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Conclusions</STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant has not asserted or demonstrated that the Administrative Judge's decision contains factual or legal error.  Accordingly, the Board affirms the Judge's 
adverse security clearance decision.</P> 
<P>Applicant concedes that her case falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1): "The person has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime and sentenced to 
imprisonment for a term exceeding one year."  Accordingly, the Board affirms the Judge's conclusion that 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 precluded her from making a 
favorable security clearance decision in Applicant's case.</P> 
<P>Under the Operating Instruction the Board cannot address the specific arguments asserted in Applicant's request that the Board recommend her case be 
considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  The Board reaches this conclusion for three reasons: (1) neither Applicant nor Department Counsel has 
challenged the Judge's findings or conclusions; (2) because the Board is not authorized  to review the Judge's recommendation that Applicant's case be 
considered for a waiver, the Board is precluded from discussing or addressing the merits of a Judge's recommendation; and (3) the Board is precluded from 
giving an explanation for its own recommendation concerning waiver.</P> 
<P>Recognizing the limits of its authority under the Operating Instruction, the Board has reviewed the evidence as a whole and states the following: The Appeal 
Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P>
