</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>On August 18, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant alleging facts which raise
security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not find that it is clearly in the national interest to grant
or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>In a sworn written statement, dated August 28, 2004, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) and elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu
of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted a  file of relevant material (FORM) in support of the government's preliminary decision, a copy of which was
received by Applicant on August 26, 2004. Applicant was afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or
mitigation by October 10, 2004. Applicant timely submitted an Answer to the SOR and a sworn statement which were received on September 13, 2004.
Interrogatories sent to Applicant were answered  on November 18, 2004. The case was assigned to me on January 21, 2005. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant has admitted the two factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence under Guideline B as stated in the SOR. These admissions are incorporated
herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record as a whole, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She is divorced, her mother and a sister live in Hong Kong, and another sister and a brother live in
the U.S.<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> She is estranged from her father who lives somewhere in the PRC and whom she has not seen since 1997.<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> She came to the U.S. in 1986, graduated
from a major university in 1993, with a degree in electrical engineering, and has made one trip to Hong Kong (1993) to visit her mother and sister since coming
to the U.S.<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Applicant has worked for six employers since college.<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> An older sister came to the U.S. in 1980 and was her sponsor in 1986. An uncle lives in the U.S. Her
mother and sister came to the U.S. in 1995 or 1996, received resident alien status, returned to Hong Kong after a year, as she did not like living in the U.S., and
Applicant remains in touch with them by weekly telephone calls.<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Applicant has cousins in PRC but does not know them.<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> She has a cousin, a citizen and
resident of Canada, with whom she keeps in frequent communication.<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>In sworn answers to interrogatories, Applicant denied she would be open to coercion, influence or pressure because she has relatives living in Hong Kong.<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> She
stated she would sever relations with these relatives if she or they were pressured, and that she would notify appropriate U.S. officials.<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Neither she nor
members of her family have any connection or employment with the Chinese government.<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Applicant has no contacts with any Chinese embassy or consulate
employee.<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></P>

<P>Her telephone conversations with her mother and sister living in PRC are to inquire about health and family matters.<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> She stated: "I will not do anything to
harm the USA even if my mother and sister are put in jeopardy. I am loyal to the USA. (T)his is my country. (T)he USA has given me the opportunity for a
much better life. I will protect this country for the freedom of opportunity we have."<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>China, an authoritarian communist regime, has an abysmal record of human rights abuses of its citizenry. Further, China is considered one of the more active
countries when it comes to espionage activities in the United States. However, China has also been trying to transform its economy to more of a free enterprise
system. A key to this effort has been to gain entry into global markets (particularly the U.S.), in exchange for increased cooperation with the west and reforms in
its internal affairs. Nonetheless, China's internal practices as well as its interests as an emerging superpower are often at odds with the United States national
interests. Therefore, any contacts in China by a person with access to classified information warrant more scrutiny than contacts with countries whose interests
and forms of government are more closely aligned with ours.<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> </P>

</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and
circumstances of each case.  Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Â¶ 6.3 of the Directive:
nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the applicant,
and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or presence of
rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating
condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be
measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Having considered the SOR
allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are those conditions listed
under guideline B (foreign influence), Directive,Â¶ E2.A2.1.2.1. <EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or
obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present, in a foreign country</EM>.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Under Guideline B, security concerns arise when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound
by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations create the potential for foreign influence
that might, in turn, result in a compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> </P>

</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">            A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or
continue to have access to classified information. The government bears an initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence,
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">prima facie </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">case that it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's
case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government,
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the
national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's
suitability for access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="02-27999.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline B by showing that Applicant has close ties of affection to individuals who are citizens of and are
living in a foreign country. As alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.a., Applicant's mother and sister are Chinese citizens. The following Guideline B disqualifying
condition applies. Directive, Â¶  E2.A2.1.2.1. <EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a
citizen of, or resident or present, in a foreign country</EM>.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The dispositive issue is whether, in light of the foregoing, Applicant's mother and sister are vulnerable to coercion by the Chinese government for purposes of
compromising U.S. national interests through the Applicant. While coercion is possible solely because her mother and sister live in Hong Kong, she has no
close ties of affection with other relatives who may live in the PRC. Her mother is an elderly pensioner, neither her mother or sister have ever been associated
with the Chinese government, and they live in Hong Kong, China's economic gateway to the west. Both relatives have resident alien status in the U.S. and lived
in this country for a year. Applicant has a brother and sister in the U.S., one a citizen of the U.S., and the other working toward citizenship.  There is no current
probability of coercion</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has lived in this country for 19 tears. She graduated from a prestigious university with an electrical engineering degree. She has worked for federal
contractors in the past and has been gainfully employed since graduation. She has no contact with her father or other relatives living in China. She has traveled
to Hong Kong and China once in 1993. Her only foreign contact is her mother and sister and I that they have no influence on her. Applicant has sworn
allegiance to the United States. Directive, Â¶  E2.A2.1.2.1., <EM>supra</EM>, applies. Mitigating conditions that apply are: Directive, Â¶  E2.A2.1.3.2. <EM>Contacts with foreign
citizens are casual</EM>; and Directive, Â¶  E2.A2.1.3.5. <EM>Foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities</EM>.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence. And I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating condition as listed under each applicable adjudicative
guideline. I have also considered the whole person concept as contemplated by the Directive </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Â¶ 6.3, and as called for by a fair and commonsense assessment of
the record before me as required by Directive </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Â¶ E2.2.3. Notwithstanding the concerns and practices of the Chinese government, I am convinced Applicant's
foreign connections do not pose a security risk. I conclude Guideline B for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
