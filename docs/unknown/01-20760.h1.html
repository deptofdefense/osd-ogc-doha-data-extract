<P>Fifty-two year old Applicant's financial problems, including some that predate a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing in 1996, were partially impacted and mitigated by 
being laid off from work for 8 months in 1995.  However, the bankruptcy court's dismissal of her case in 1997 for her failure to make payments to creditors and 
Applicant's unsubstantiated efforts to resolve debts until confronted with the prospect of being denied a security clearance raise serious doubt that it is 
consistent with national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information.  Applicant also failed to reveal delinquent indebtedness in completing her 
security clearance application.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On May 31, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>,<EM> </EM>dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR states that DOHA was 
unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to any classified information and recommends that her case be submitted 
to an Administrative Judge.  On June 25, 2002, the  Applicant provided a response to the SOR and requested a decision on the written record, in lieu of a 
hearing.  The Applicant received the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six documents, on September 18, 2002 and has not submitted any additional 
information or objections to the material contained therein.  This case was assigned to the undersigned Administrative Judge on November 25, 2002.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact: </P> 
<P>Applicant is a 52 year-old female employed by a defense contractor and is seeking to obtain a security clearance.</P> 
<P>Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on January 18, 1996.<A HREF="01-20760.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  This was precipitated by Applicant being laid off by her employer for approximately eight 
months in 1995.  During this period, Applicant obtained other employment but her income was substantially reduced.  At this time, Applicant was a single 
parent supporting two children.  Applicant began to make the monthly payments to creditors required by the bankruptcy court.  At some point, she was only 
able to make partial payments.  This caused the bankruptcy court to dismiss her action on December 16, 1997 (Item 3).</P> 
<P>Applicant has several delinquent debts that she has not resolved.  This includes debts that predate her bankruptcy filing in 1996.<A HREF="01-20760.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant is indebted to a collection agency for a bad debt in collection (Item 3).  The amount of the indebtedness was $9571.00 in November 2000 (Item 6 at 
7).<A HREF="01-20760.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant's debt to a collection agency was reported to the credit bureau in July 2000 (Item 6 at 7).  The debt resulted from an account with a national 
credit card company that Applicant jointly held with her mother, who was the primary debtor on the account (Item 3 at 1).</P> 
<P>Applicant is indebted to a national credit card company.  The amount of the indebtedness was $2087.00 in November 2000.  Applicant has owed this debt since 
November 1995 (Item 6 at 5).</P> 
<P>Applicant is indebted to a bank for an account opened in July 1998 (Item 3 at 1).  The amount of the indebtedness was $821.00 in November 2000.  Applicant's 
debt to a bank was 120 days past due as of November 17, 2000 (Item 6 at 5).</P> 
<P>Applicant has unresolved indebtedness to a satellite television company (Item 3 at 1).<A HREF="01-20760.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant has unresolved indebtedness to an automobile financing company for a charged off account on her involuntary repossession (Item 3 at 1).  The 
repossession occurred in July 1995 (Item 4).</P> 
<P>When Applicant completed a security clearance application on July 25, 2000, she denied she had any debts that were over 180 days delinquent in the past seven 
years or that were currently over 90 days delinquent (Item 4 at 6).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon an individual meeting adjudicative guidelines discussed in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  An 
evaluation of whether an applicant meets these guidelines includes the consideration of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept."  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a decision. This assessment should include 
the following factors:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of 
participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 provides conditions for each guideline that could raise a concern and may be disqualifying , as well as further conditions that could mitigate a 
concern and support granting a clearance.  The following guidelines are applicable to this case.</P> 
<P>Guideline F - Financial Considerations:  the concern is that an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to 
generate funds.  </P> 
<P>Conditions that could  raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
<P>E2.A6.1.2.1  A history of not meeting financial considerations;</P> 
<P>E2.A6.1.2.3  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</P> 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
<P>E2.A6.1.3.3  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation);</P> 
<P>E2.A6.1.3.6  The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</P> 
<P>Guideline E - Personal Conduct:  The concern is conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and  regulations could  indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</P> 
<P>E2.A5.1.2.2  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility 
or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Section E2.2.2 of the Directive requires that "any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national interest will be resolved 
in favor of national security." The burden of producing evidence initially falls on the Government to present evidence, in accordance with the Directive, that it 
is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  Once the Government meets its burden, 
the burden then shifts to the applicant to present evidence to refute or mitigate the Government's evidence and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Financial Considerations</P> 
<P>The facts in the record that are discussed below establish conditions that not only raise security concerns, a history of not meeting financial obligations as well 
as an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, but are of such gravity as to be disqualifying in this case.  Applicant  has bad debts that total more than 
$12,000.00.  They include bad debts that preceded her unsuccessful bankruptcy filing in 1996 that she has still not resolved.  Furthermore, Applicant has 
acquired additional bad debts since the dismissal of her bankruptcy case in 1997 that also remain unresolved.  Applicant demonstrated no interest in attempting 
to resolve several of them until she was faced with the prospect of being denied a security clearance for having failed to do so.  There is also no evidence the 
Applicant has ever sought counseling in an effort to resolve her financial problems.  The length of time that Applicant has had financial difficulties as well as 
her inability or unwillingness to resolve them exposes her as a national security risk.</P> 
<P>Applicant's assertion that since September 2000, she has made $250.00 payments on the debt to a collection agency has limited support in the record.  
Applicant's credit report does indicate that there was a $250.00 reduction of the debt to $9571.00 in September 2000 (Item 6 at 7).  However, Applicant has 
failed to provide proof of further payments. </P> 
<P>Applicant's credit report indicates that her debt to a national credit card company had not been reduced from the balance of $2087.00 that existed since 
November 1995 (Item 6 at 5).  In February 2001, Applicant admitted she had not made any further payments on this account since the dismissal of her 
bankruptcy action in 1997 (Item 5 at 3).  Although Applicant alleges she had reduced the balance to $827.34 by June 2002, she has not provided proof to 
support such payments.  The same is true with respect to her assertion that she would commence $89.00 per month payments on the balance starting the last 
week of June 2002. </P> 
<P>Although admitting, "I haven't made a payment this year," Applicant contended that she had paid an unspecified  portion of the debt to a bank and that she 
would contact the bank to set up a payment plan for the unpaid balance (Item 3 at 1).  As of the closing of the record, however, Applicant has not provided 
proof of any payments or of having set up a payment plan.</P> 
<P>With regard to her indebtedness to a satellite television company, Applicant alleges she does not owe anything because she "sent the items back" (Item 3 at 1).  
She further states that she had talked with a representative of the company and was advised to write a letter of dispute.  Applicant said that she would do so but 
she has not provided a copy of such a letter or any other evidence of her basis for disputing the account with the company. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant's indebtedness to an automobile financing company is another debt that existed prior to her bankruptcy filing in 1996.  In February 2001, Applicant 
contended that she had been making $100.00 per month payments on the account up until three or four months before her statement but was forced to stop 
when she began helping her daughter financially (Item 5 at 2).  In her response to the SOR, Applicant argued she stopped paying this account because she has a 
lawsuit against the creditor for being overcharged interest.  However, Applicant has not submitted any proof of having been overcharged or of having filed a 
lawsuit.</P> 
<P>Applicant's Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing in 1996 appears to have been precipitated by her lay off from a defense contractor in 1995.  This is indicative of a 
mitigation condition (MC) E2.A6.1.3.3 ( the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control).  Moreover,  filing for Chapter 13 
bankruptcy could be evidence of MC E2.A6.1.3.6 ( the individual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) since the 
procedure is not intended to relieve the petitioner of the debts but merely to enable the petitioner to pay them over an extended period of time.  In this case, 
however, those mitigation conditions are superseded by Applicant's subsequent actions.  The bankruptcy court dismissed Applicant's case the year after her 
filing for her failure to pay creditors.  Moreover, Applicant has still not been able to resolve all of the debts covered by her bankruptcy filing more than six years 
after her employment with the defense contractor was reestablished. </P> 
<P>Personal Conduct</P> 
<P>The Government fails to establish that Applicant should have reported the debt to a bank.  Applicant's credit report indicates that the debt to a bank was 120 
days past due on November 17, 2000 (Item 6 at 5).  However, this is nearly four months after she executed the security clearance application.  Therefore, the 
evidence fails to establish that this debt was delinquent at the time Applicant completed the security clearance application.</P> 
<P>Applicant's credit report indicates that the debt to a collection agency was reported in July 2000, the same month in which Applicant executed the security 
clearance application (Item 6 at 7).  The fact a collection agency was reporting the debt would infer that the underlying debt had been delinquent for a 
significant period of time.  However, there is no evidence of when the underlying debt became delinquent.  In addition, the Government has not refuted 
Applicant's contention that the underlying debt resulted from an joint account that her mother opened.  This suggests that Applicant may not have been notified 
when the underlying debt became delinquent.  The evidence is not sufficient for me to conclude that Applicant should have reported the debt to a collection 
agency when she completed the security clearance application.</P> 
<P>Applicant's debt to a national credit card company is an entirely different matter.  Applicant's credit report reveals the debt was covered by her unsuccessful 
bankruptcy filing (Item 6 at 5).  Applicant should have identified this debt in response to both questions 38 and 39 on the security clearance application since it 
has been delinquent since at least 1995 and still has not been satisfied.  Applicant argues, "debts that were delinquent were included in the bankruptcy," and, "I 
didn't know I should report them again."  Apparently, Applicant is referring to her response to question 33, in which she revealed her bankruptcy filing.  
However, her response failed to identify any of the underlying debts or even the fact that her filing was unsuccessful and she was unable to resolve all of the 
underlying debts.  Moreover, an answer to question 33 fails to address question 39, whether Applicant is currently delinquent on any debts.  At the time that 
Applicant executed the security clearance application, she knew her debt to a national credit card company was still delinquent and that it had been delinquent 
for more than 180 days within the past seven years.  By responding, "no," to both questions, she provided answers that she knew to be false. </P> 
<P>For the reasons stated, I conclude that Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information. </P>
