  The record evidence does not support the Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant did not abuse prescription pain medication to the point of addiction.  The record evidence does not support the Judge's finding that Applicant received a favorable prognosis from his treating physician.  Given the record evidence, the Judge  erred by not applying Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition 3 and by applying Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions 3 and 4.  Under the Directive, there is no  authority to grant Applicant's request for a probationary or conditional security clearance.  Favorable decision reversed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated July 24, 2003 which stated the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline H (Drug Involvement).  Administrative Judge Roger C. 
Wesley issued a favorable security clearance decision dated January 29, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel appealed the Administrative Judge's favorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether certain factual findings by the Administrative Judge are erroneous; (2) whether the Administrative Judge 
misapplied pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines; and (3) whether Applicant can be granted a probationary or conditional security clearance.  For the 
reasons that follow, the Board reverses the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal 
error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed 
factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why 
party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the 
Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational 
connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect 
of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of 
opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary 
to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state 
or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article 
VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such 
relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The 
Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the 
evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility 
determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal 
cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and 
E3.1.33.3).</P>

</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether certain factual findings by the Administrative Judge are erroneous</SPAN>.  Department Counsel contends the Administrative Judge erred by finding: (a) Applicant's 
use of prescription pain medication had not been shown to be abusive to the point of addiction; (b) Applicant used pain medication to excess during military service 
between 1998 and 2002; (c) Applicant consulted multiple military and civilian facilities to obtain prescription medication; and (d) Applicant's pain management specialist 
gave a favorable prognosis.<A HREF="02-20110.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The Board must consider whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In making this review, the Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of ths 
Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.<A HREF="02-20110.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  In doing so, the Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence 
supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's 
findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel correctly points out that the record evidence shows Applicant was diagnosed in 1999 with "prescription opiate dependence" and "opiate withdrawal 
- active" (Government Exhibit 4).  Indeed, on appeal, Applicant does not dispute that he was so diagnosed.<A HREF="02-20110.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The Judge's finding that Applicant did not use prescription 
pain medication to the point of addiction cannot be sustained because there is documentary medical evidence that plainly contradicts the Judge's finding.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel correctly notes that there is no record evidence that Applicant served in the military, or that Applicant consulted military facilities to obtain 
prescription medication.  Therefore, to the extent the Judge's findings refer to military service or military facilities, they are erroneous and not sustainable.</P> 
 
<P>The record evidence in this case does not support the Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant's pain management specialist "expresses confidence in Applicant's 
ability to avoid prescription drug abuse through his new medication regimen" and "assur[es] that Applicant can continue to perform his assigned duties without risk of 
judgment lapses so long as he remains [o]n his prescribed medication" (Decision at p. 6).  At the hearing, the Administrative Judge expressed concern that Applicant had 
not submitted any documentary evidence from his treating physicians that would provide a prognosis concerning his taking prescription pain medication for his medical 
condition (Hearing Transcript at p. 51).<A HREF="02-20110.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The Judge granted Applicant time to obtain such documentation and submit it after the hearing (Hearing Transcript at p. 52).  
Applicant made a post-hearing submission (Applicant Exhibit B), which was admitted into evidence without objection from Department Counsel.  Applicant Exhibit B 
consists of three one-page documents: a November 7, 2003 cover letter from Applicant; a one-page November 5, 2003 letter from a physician treating Applicant for 
renal stones; and a one-page November 6, 2003 letter from a physician treating Applicant for "intractable pain syndrome &amp; cephalgia."  The November 6, 2003 letter 
from the physician treating Applicant for pain states "[Applicant's first name]'s prognosis is: guarded, will require pain medication indefinitely, monitor in office every 3 mo.  
Patient is stable on medication and able to perform daily activities."  The Judge's findings place a favorable gloss on the November 6, 2003 letter that does not reflect a 
plausible interpretation of that document in light of the record evidence as a whole.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge misapplied pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines</SPAN>.  Department Counsel contends the Administrative Judge erred by: (a) 
not applying Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition 3; (b) misapplying Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 4; and (c) misapplying Drug Involvement Mitigating 
Condition 3.  For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes Department Counsel's contentions have merit.</P> 
 
<P>(a) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition 3</SPAN>.  Department Counsel contends the Administrative Judge should have applied Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition 
3<A HREF="02-20110.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> because Government Exhibit 4 shows Applicant was diagnosed with "prescription opiate dependence" and "opiate withdrawal - active."  This claim of error is 
persuasive.  Judges are required to apply pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines.<A HREF="02-20110.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  If there are Adjudicative Guidelines that, on their face, appear to be 
applicable to the facts of a particular case, then the Judge must apply them or articulate a rational basis for not doing so.<A HREF="02-20110.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  As noted earlier in this decision, the Judge's 
finding that Applicant did not use prescription pain medication to the point of addiction cannot be sustained.  Given the record evidence in this case, the Judge's failure to 
apply Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition 3 is indicative of arbitrary and capricious action by the Judge.</P> 
 
<P>(b) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 4</SPAN>.  Department Counsel contends the Administrative Judge erred by applying Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 4<A HREF="02-20110.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> 
because (i) the Judge relied on erroneous fact-finding to apply that mitigating condition; (ii) there is not sufficient record evidence to support a finding of a favorable 
prognosis; and (iii) Applicant failed to present medical evidence to corroborate his claims about his regimen of taking pain medication.</P> 
 
<P>Given the totality of the record evidence in this case, the Administrative Judge's application of Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 4 is not sustainable. The medical 
reports from Applicant's current treating physicians (Applicant Exhibit B) do not provide a reasonable basis for the Judge to conclude Applicant has been given a 
favorable prognosis.<A HREF="02-20110.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Indeed, on appeal, Applicant acknowledges that the reports from his current treating physicians "did not provide a forecast or prognosis with 
respect to Applicant's possible future medication abuse."<A HREF="02-20110.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Moreover, given the record evidence of Applicant's history of abusing prescription pain medication (including 
a diagnosis of prescription opiate dependence) and Applicant's failure to present medical documentation to corroborate his statements about his use of prescription pain 
medication, Applicant's testimony does not provide a sufficient basis for the Judge's application of Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 4.  Even if the Judge concluded 
that Applicant was a credible witness, such a favorable credibility determination is no substitute for medical evidence corroborating Applicant's statements about his 
medical condition and his ability to comply with his regimen of prescription pain medication.<A HREF="02-20110.a1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Given the record evidence of Applicant's history of abusing prescription 
pain medication to the point of diagnosed dependence, it was arbitrary and capricious for the Judge to rely on Applicant's uncorroborated, second-hand, lay testimony 
about the medical opinion of Applicant's pain management specialist.</P> 
 
<P>(c) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 3</SPAN>.  Department Counsel contends the Administrative Judge misapplied Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 3<A HREF="02-20110.a1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> because: (i) 
the medical reports from Applicant's treating physicians provide no support for application of that mitigating condition; and (ii) the record evidence of Applicant's history 
of abusing prescription pain medication undercuts his uncorroborated testimony about his current use of prescription pain medication.  This contention has merit.</P> 
 
<P>The medical reports from Applicant's treating physicians (Applicant Exhibit B) provide no meaningful support for the Administrative Judge's application of Drug 
Involvement Mitigating Condition 3.  Given Applicant's history of abusing prescription pain medication, the absence of medical evidence corroborating Applicant's 
statements is very significant because the record evidence shows Applicant will continue to require prescription pain medication for the foreseeable future,<A HREF="02-20110.a1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> and because 
Applicant gave testimony about his use of prescription pain medication that was not consistent with an April 16, 2002 letter from a physician who had treated him.</P> 
 
<P> Given the totality of the record evidence in this case, the Administrative Judge had a rational basis for concluding that Applicant's history of abusing prescription pain 
medication raised security concerns.  In light of the evidence about Applicant's history of abusing prescription pain medication, Applicant had the burden of "presenting 
witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of 
persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision."<A HREF="02-20110.a1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  The totality of the errors identified by Department Counsel persuades the Board that the Judge failed to 
articulate a sustainable basis for his conclusion that Applicant had satisfied his burden of persuasion.</P> 
 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether Applicant can be granted a probationary or conditional security clearance</SPAN>.  On appeal, Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge's favorable security 
clearance decision should be affirmed.  Because of the various errors identified by Department Counsel, the Judge's decision cannot be affirmed.  Applicant asks, in the 
alternative, that he be allowed a  probationary period to allow him to demonstrate he is using prescription pain medication in a proper, nonabusive manner.<A HREF="02-20110.a1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  Under the 
Directive, there is no authority to grant a probationary or conditional security clearance.<A HREF="02-20110.a1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel has demonstrated harmful error below that warrants reversal.  Accordingly, pursuant to Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.33.3, 
the Board reverses the Administrative Judge's favorable security clearance decision.</P>
