<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June 23, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided on the written 
record.  On February 15, 2006, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.<A HREF="04-10888.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  
Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process of law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant argues he was denied due process of law because the 30 day time period in which he had to respond to the government's file of relevant material 
(FORM) was too short to allow him to acquire copies of the financial documents necessary to address the government's concerns, given the fact that he lives 
and works in the Republic of Korea.<A HREF="04-10888.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The Board does not find this argument persuasive. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A review of the record indicates Applicant was provided with the procedural rights set forth in Executive Order 10865 and the Directive.  Applicant received 
the FORM on September 28, 2005.  The Administrative Judge issued his decision on February 15, 2006.  Applicant did not make a request for additional time 
during the 30 day period he had to respond to the FORM--even though Applicant was provided with both mailing and telephonic contact information.  Nor did 
Applicant make a request for additional time during the three month period between the submission of the FORM to the Administrative Judge and the issuance 
of the Judge's decision.  In any event, Applicant did not establish that he was prejudiced by the processing of his case.  He did not provide evidence that he had 
paid or otherwise resolved his debts.  Although </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>pro se</EM> applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely, reasonable steps to 
protect their rights under the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 00-0593 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001).  If they fail to take timely, reasonable steps to protect 
their rights, that failure to act does not constitute a denial of their rights.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-19896 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2003).  Because Applicant 
did not make a request for additional time to collect evidence and respond to the FORM, he was not denied due process under the Directive or Executive Order.</SPAN></P>
