<P>Applicant has a history of delinquent financial indebtedness that will soon be fully resolved. She failed to disclose a number of arrests in a security clearance 
application she submitted and during the course of an interview. Her explanation for failing to disclose the arrests and of the action she took to clear up the 
omissions prior to being confronted with them is believable. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns caused by her financial considerations and personal 
conduct. Clearance is granted.  </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On May 10, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-23287.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges security concerns under Guideline F, for financial considerations, and Guideline E, for personal conduct.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a sworn answer to the SOR, dated June 21, 2004, requested a hearing, and admitted all but two of the financial consideration SOR 
allegations. She admitted answering questions about her financial delinquencies incorrectly in the security clearance application she submitted and during the 
course of an interview, but denied she intended to intentionally falsify the application or omit information during the interview.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">This case was assigned to me on September 10, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on October 18, 2004, scheduling the hearing for November 9, 2004. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted seven documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-7, and admitted 
into the record without objection. Applicant testified at the hearing, and submitted fourteen documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits 
(AE) 1-14, and admitted into the record without objection. The record was held open to provide Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documents in 
support of her case. Seven additional documents were timely received, marked as AE 15-21, and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was 
received on November 17, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's partial admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I 
make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 42 years old, divorced, and the mother of two daughters, ages 20 and 17. She has been employed by a defense contractor as an information 
assurance analyst since June 2002. She graduated from high school in 1980, and obtained a bachelor's degree in business administration and information 
systems in August 2003. She went through seven jobs between October 1994 and June 2001, and was unemployed from June 15, 2001 to April 15, 2002. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's financial problems appear to have begun in about 1999. Her financial difficulties were caused by the misuse of credit, an illness her daughter 
suffered, and ten months of unemployment she experienced from 2001-02. The SOR lists six accounts totaling $19,710.00 that have been submitted for 
collection, two accounts totaling $1,089.00 that have resulted in the entry of judgments against Applicant, one charged off account in the amount of $1,117.00, 
and one account in the amount of $2,567.00 that was at least 90 days past due.<A HREF="03-23287.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has paid three small accounts in full (those listed in subparagraphs 1.f., 1.h., and 1.i.), and has successfully disputed the account listed in 
subparagraph 1.d. as not belonging to her. She believably testified she was not liable for the account listed in subparagraph 1.c. because it was to be paid by 
workman's compensation insurance. The account listed in subparagraph 1.j. is one on which she co-signed for a friend, and on which the friend is now current 
in repaying. Applicant is making small payments on the remaining accounts, and will have them fully repaid by about March 2005 when she receives the 
proceeds from her one-half interest in real estate that was purchased for $85,000.00 and is being sold for $625,000.00.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant consulted a financial investment corporation to assist her with the resolution of her delinquent accounts and the investment of the proceeds she will 
be receiving from the real estate sale. With their assistance and on their advice, she diverted money from a pension fund to the payment of debts because the tax 
penalty incurred was significantly outweighed by the interest and penalties that were saved. Her financial advisor expressed confidence that she will remain in 
full compliance with the payment arrangements they have worked out. He also indicated he will continue to evaluate her progress and make additional 
recommendations as needed. The advisor believes Applicant has a good grasp and understanding of the information that has been provided to her, and that she 
has vigorously adopted their recommendations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was charged with grand larceny on May 27, 1982, possession of phencyclidine on June 27, 1983, possession of marijuana on April 25, 1990, 
possession of cocaine on March 10, 1990,<A HREF="03-23287.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and assault and battery of a family member on June 20, 1999. The grand larceny charge occurred after she walked 
out of a shop in an amusement park with a stuffed animal that she had not paid for. The drug charges resulted from police searches of vehicles that she was 
either driving or in which she was a passenger. The assault charge occurred when she pushed her roommate out the door of their residence because he was 
intoxicated. All charges were either dismissed or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>nolle prossed</EM>. Applicant's testimony that she was not guilty of any of the offenses is credible.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant failed to list all but one of the above arrests, a possession of controlled substance arrest she reported as occurring on January 1, 1991, in response to 
applicable questions in a security clearance application (SF 86) she executed on June 24, 2002. She did list charges of contempt of court and having a dog 
without a license from 2001, both of which resulted in her being found guilty and ordered to pay fines. Applicant explained the omissions were due to a 
combination of her hurriedly preparing the SF 86 and forgetting the other incidents. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was interviewed by a special agent from the Defense Security Service (DSS) on October 7, 2002. She provided the agent with information about the 
controlled substance arrest, the contempt of court, and the dog license charges she had disclosed in the SF 86, and the assault and battery charge, but 
affirmatively stated: "I have had no other drug-related arrests, charges, or court appearances." She testified that after the interview she realized she had forgotten 
to tell the agents of the other arrests, and contacted him by telephone to inform him of the omissions. However, the agent informed her the file was no longer in 
his possession and, therefore, he could not accept any additional information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">           </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F, 
pertaining to financial considerations and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-23287.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-23287.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="03-23287.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="03-23287.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-23287.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-23287.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-23287.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-23287.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-23287.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="03-23287.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides 
an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has numerous accounts that became delinquent beginning in approximately 1999, and that were either charged off, submitted for collection, or 
resulted in judgments being entered against her. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>; and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts </EM>apply.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">While Applicant's financial problems seem to have originated with her misuse of credit, they were severely exacerbated by her daughter's health problems and 
a lengthy period of unemployment. She has now paid off several of the smaller accounts, retained the services of a financial advisor, and will have abundant 
funds to satisfy all her creditors within a few months. Applicant is entitled to some credit under Mitigating Condition (MC) 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The conditions that resulted in 
the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation)</EM>; and full credit under MC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control</EM>; and MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Applicant failed to disclose several arrests in response to applicable questions in the SF 86 she 
submitted, and during the course of an interview with a DSS special agent. Her explanation for failing to do so is credible, particularly in view of information 
she did disclose. Further, having viewed Applicant's appearance and demeanor, and considering the content of her testimony, I find her testimony that she 
called the agent after they met in an effort to supply the omitted information credible. Because there was no deliberate omission or falsification of the SF 86 or 
during the interview, no disqualifying condition applies.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, including the Applicant's testimony and exhibits, the whole person concept, 
the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has mitigated the 
security concerns that existed in this case. She has overcome the case against her and satisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion. Guidelines F and E are 
decided for Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
