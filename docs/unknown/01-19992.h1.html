<P>Applicant's excessive indebtedness caused by the defense industry downturn and his divorce have not been mitigated by sufficient evidence of reform and 
rehabilitation.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 4, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether his clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 22, 2002, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to 
the undersigned on March 12, 2002 and the matter was set for April 18, 2002.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 12, 2002, a letter from Applicant's Counsel indicated that Applicant 
was in the hospital and possibly unavailable for the hearing date.  On April 15, 2002, Department Counsel requested a continuance based upon good cause, and 
with no objection from Applicant's counsel, the continuance was granted.  A notice of hearing was issued on May 10, 2002, and the hearing was rescheduled 
for May 30, 2002.  On May 22, 2002, Applicant's Counsel requested a continuance, which was denied.  At the hearing the Government presented five exhibits.  
The Applicant presented three exhibits and testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on June 7, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 51 years old.  He is President and 40% shareholder of his company, a defense contractor, and is applying for a security clearance in connection 
with his employment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</SPAN>  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially 
overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has worked for the defense industry for the past thirty-two years.  In October 1984 he formed his own company, which over the years became 
quite successful.  During the defense industry boom, prior to 1994, the Applicant earned between $400,000.00 and $900,000.00 dollars in gross income 
annually.  (Tr. P. 17).  His credit was straight triple A, and he was living a lavish lifestyle.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Beginning in early 1995, things drastically changed. The defense industry cutbacks began, and the Applicant took a huge cut in income and in company 
earnings.  In 1995, the Applicant's annual income dropped to approximately $80,000.00.  In 1997, he received only between $25,000.00 and $30,000.00 dollars 
in actual income from the company.   In order to pay his debts, the Applicant  liquidated many of his assets, including rental property, a race car, motors, a 
motorcycle, and a motor home.  (Tr. pp. 18-19).  The Applicant states that, "Almost every month I am getting rid of something."  (Tr. p. 78).  From 1995 until 
this past year, the Applicant's company has been on a downhill slide.  To stay in business the Applicant closed several of his offices and sought to expand his 
company into more promising and lucrative areas.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 1994, the Applicant and his wife separated, and in November 1999 the divorce was finalized.  During the five years between their separation and 
their divorce, the Applicant maintained his household as well as that of his wife's without a court order.  (Tr. p. 21).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant contends that the debts set forth in allegations, 1.a., 1.b.,1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f.,  1.h., 1i., 1.j., 1.l., 1.n., 1.o., are all debts that were incurred by his 
former spouse.  In June 1999, the Applicant's wife filed bankruptcy, in her name only, and discharged her debt in September 1999.  Although the Applicant 
contends that the debt she discharged was hers alone, he has accepted responsibility for it.  This debt totals almost  $37,000.00.  The Applicant states that he 
would like to pay this debt.  (Tr. p. 32).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As a direct result of the defense industry's economic downturn, the Applicant acquired many delinquent debts, and admits to all but one of the delinquent debts 
referred to in the SOR.  (<EM>See</EM> Tr. pp. 52-53).  The following debts remain outstanding: The Applicant is indebted to Creditor A, for a delinquent credit card 
account, in the approximate amount of $1,678.00; Creditor B, for a delinquent credit card, in the approximate amount of $7,612.00; Creditor C, to a city, in the 
approximate amount of $982.00; Creditor D, a cable company, in the approximate amount of $36.00; Creditor E, for a delinquent credit card account in the 
approximate amount of $7,905.00; Creditor F, for a delinquent debt in the approximate amount of $ 2,815.00; Creditor G, an attorney, in the approximate 
amount of $34,000.00; Creditor I, a telephone company, in the approximate amount of $237.00; Creditor J, a delinquent credit card account, in the approximate 
amount of $13,186.00; Creditor K, for a delinquent doctor bill, in the approximate amount of $660.00; Creditor L, for a delinquent hospital bill in the 
approximate amount of $284.00; Creditor M, an attorney in the approximate amount of $3,800.00; Creditor N, for a delinquent debt in the approximate amount 
of $81.00; and Creditor O, a bank in the amount of approximately $1,827.00. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Creditor P,Q and R, refer to delinquent State A taxes in the amount of approximately $89,172.98.  The Applicant has reduced this debt to approximately 
$70,000.00.  Creditor S and T are delinquent federal taxes in the approximate amount of $212,329.73 that are still outstanding.  The Applicant contends that the 
original debt was $330,000.00 and he been paying it down.  Creditor U,  delinquent State B taxes in the approximate amount of $1,589.74 are also still owing.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant states that he paid off Creditor H, a delinquent hospital bill in the approximate amount of $230.00.  The Applicant's personal financial statement 
dated December 11, 2000, indicates that he has a monthly net remainder of $619.00, after his monthly expenses.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 2).  The Applicant 
contends that he has been working hard to pay down some of his debt, concentrating on his taxes first. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has decided that he does not want to file bankruptcy, but hopes to rebuild his business and pay off these outstanding debts.  (Tr. pp. 24-25).  
Business revenues have doubled since last year, increasing from a half million dollars to a little over a million.  However, the Applicant's annual income has 
not significantly increased.  (Tr. p. 23).  His gross salary is currently approximately $100,000.00 a year.  (Tr. p. 68).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant submitted a number of letters of appreciation from the Department of the Navy attesting to  the outstanding work and quality craftsmanship over 
and above the call of duty provided by the Applicant's company.  (See Applicant's Exhibit A).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business turndown, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in financial irresponsibility  which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has excessive indebtedness (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor 
judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a 
nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Admittedly, since early 1995, the Applicant has experienced a rough period with his business, significantly impacted by the defense cutbacks, not caused by any 
fault of his own. During much this period he was also going through a costly divorce.  These unforeseen unfortunate circumstances resulted in him 
accumulating enormous debt.  A business downturn and a divorce are conditions that could under some circumstances mitigate security concerns as to why he 
accumulated the debt.  Now the question is, what has he done about the debt?  In this case, the Applicant remains under extreme financial duress.  The 
Applicant states that he has chosen not to file bankruptcy, but to pay off this debt.  It is unclear how he is going to do this.  There is no plan or method he has 
established to accomplish this task.  The fact is that the Applicant remains delinquent as to each of the creditors listed in the SOR, except allegation 1.h.  The 
Applicant has not initiated a good faith effort to repay or otherwise resolve these debts.  His stated intention to pay his creditors is good, however, he has not 
shown a systematic pattern of payment towards reaching this goal.  The total amount owed remains well  in excess of $300,000,00.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has a long road ahead to reduce his indebtedness.  Given this uncertainty and the size of his outstanding indebtedness, the risk is too great that he 
could engage in illegal acts that could jeopardize the national security.  There is no evidence in mitigation that would negate the negative impact his financial 
situation has on his security worthiness.  At this time, I cannot find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant the Applicant a security 
clearance.  Accordingly, Guideline F, Financial Considerations, is found against the Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of 
Reasons.</SPAN></P>
