<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 15 July 2003, under the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="02-09802.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-09802.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns 
raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 8 August 2003 
and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 8 September 2003.  On 6 November 2003, I convened a hearing 
to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 
of the proceeding on 18 November 2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor who runs simulators for training military personnel.  He started smoking marijuana when he was 
13.  He smoked once or twice a month until he graduated from high school.  After he graduated, he used marijuana "on nearly a daily basis."  Ex. 2 at 2.  In 
1980, he was cited for possession of marijuana.  He pled guilty and paid a small fine.  He continued to use marijuana while he served in the U.S. Navy from 
December 1984 to February 1996.  After leaving the Navy, Applicant continued to use marijuana until at least 1999.  Applicant admits experimenting with 
cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and hallucinogenic mushrooms </P> 
 
<P>On 8 August 1996, Applicant completed his questionnaire for national security positions (SF 86) and certified that his answers were "true, complete, and 
correct to the best of [his] knowledge and belief."  Ex. 1 at 9.  Applicant answered "no" to Question 24(a) of the SF 86 which asked if he had illegally used any 
controlled substances.  On 23 January 2002, when confronted by a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent, Applicant admitted, in a signed, sworn statement, 
using marijuana, cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and hallucinogenic mushrooms, but denied using marijuana while in the Navy. </P> 
 
<P>On 26 July 1999, Applicant was admitted to a behavioral wellness center.  He was extremely manic.  Applicant was diagnosed by a physician as having a 
bipolar disorder, manic, and being a polysubstance abuser.  Ex. 3 at 3.  Applicant is currently taking medication to control his bipolar disorder and appears to 
have his bipolar condition under control.  His doctors do not believe his medical condition poses a threat to national security.  Exs. D, E.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H-Drug Involvement</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant used marijuana from 1974 to 1999 (&para; 1.a.), used cocaine in 1984 and 1997 (&para; 1.b.), abused crystal methamphetamine (&para; 
1.c.), and was diagnosed as a polysubstance abuser (&para; 1.d.).  The improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an applicant's 
willingness or ability too protect classified information.  Drug abuse may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized 
disclosure of classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A8.1.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant abused several drugs-marijuana, cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and hallucinogenic mushrooms.  DC E2.A8.1.2.1.  He also has a diagnosis by a 
credentialed medical professional of drug abuse.  DC E2.A8.1.2.3.  The drug involvement was not recent, the last admitted use being in 1999.  MC E2.A8.1.3.1.  
Although Applicant claimed it was his intent not to use marijuana in the future (<EM>see </EM>MC E2.A8.1.3.3.), in light of his history of making false or misleading 
statements, I did not find his claim to be credible.  In weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I considered that Applicant was still using marijuana 
when he denied such use on his SF 86 in 1996.  Under the circumstances, the disqualifying conditions outweigh the mitigating condition.  Finding is against 
Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified his answer to question 24(a) on his security clearance application by deliberately failing to disclose his use of 
marijuana in the previous seven years.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness 
to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant deliberately omitted, concealed, and falsified relevant and material facts from a personnel security questionnaire by failing to disclose his drug use 
during the previous seven years.  DC E2.A5.1.2.2.  Although the falsification was not recent (1996), it was not an isolated incident.  Applicant continued to lie 
or mislead the Government concerning his illegal use of drugs.  When confronted by the DSS agent with his history of drug abuse, Applicant denied using 
marijuana while he was in the Navy.  Ex. 2 at 2.  He admitted such use under cross-examination at the hearing.  Tr. 39, 40.  Thus, MC E2.A5.1.3.2. is not 
applicable.  Finding is against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
