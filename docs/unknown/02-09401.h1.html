<P>Applicant is 37 years old and employed by a defense contractor.  His wife is a citizen of Malaysia, where her parents, brothers, and sisters reside.  Applicant's 
wife holds a passport from Malaysia; to facilitate future travel to Malaysia to support her family, if necessary, she does not presently intend to seek citizenship 
in the United States when eligible.  Applicant and his wife own real property in Malaysia that constitutes 25% of their net worth.  Applicant has not mitigated 
the security concerns arising from the foreign residence of his wife's family members or his financial interests in a foreign country.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (the "Directive"), the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On November 5, 2003, DOHA issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision: security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the 
SOR in writing on December 1, 2003, and admitted all the factual allegations.  He elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  
Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on January 9, 2004.  Department Counsel provided a complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM) to Applicant, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying 
conditions.  Applicant received the FORM on January 26, 2004, but did not provide additional materials for consideration.  The case was initially assigned to 
another administrative judge but was transferred to me on August 3, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations contained in the SOR.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is 37 years old and has been married since November 1999.  Item 4, Security Clearance Application, dated November 20, 2000, at 2.  He is a United 
States citizen by birth, and his parents, brothers, and sisters are all citizens and residents of this country.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 1, 3-4.  Applicant has worked for a defense 
contractor as a design engineer since October 2000 and seeks a security clearance for the first time.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 2, 9.</P> 
<P>Applicant's wife was born in Malaysia and is a citizen of that country.  <EM>Id. </EM>at 3.  She is a permanent resident of the United States, and works as a software 
engineer.  Item 5, Statement of Subject, dated December 18, 2001, at 1.  Her parents and five brothers and sisters still live in Malaysia.  <EM>Id.</EM>  Applicant did not 
indicate what his spouse's family members do for a living, but states none of them have any connection with the government of Malaysia and they are favorably 
disposed toward the United States.  <EM>Id.</EM>  Applicant's spouse has considered applying for citizenship in the United States when she becomes eligible, but 
recognizes that it would restrict her ability to visit Malaysia for longer periods if necessary to tend to family business involving her parents.  <EM>Id.</EM></P> 
<P>Applicant denies having any foreign property, business connections, or financial interests in a foreign country.  Item 4, <EM>supra, </EM>at 6.  He and his wife own a 
house in Malaysia that she bought as a residence for her parents.  Item 5, <EM>supra</EM>, at 2.  The house is worth about $60,000, which constitutes about 25% of their 
net worth. <EM>Id.</EM></P> 
<P>Applicant and his wife visited her family in Malaysia in June 2000 and October-November 2001. <EM> </EM>Item 4, <EM>supra</EM>, at 6; Item 5, <EM>supra,</EM> at 2.  Applicant indicates 
they will visit her family in Malaysia about every two years.  Item 5, <EM>supra,</EM> at 2.  Otherwise, they maintain regular contact with her family by telephone and e-mail<EM>.  Id.</EM></P> 
<P>Terrorist organizations, including those linked to al-Qaida, are operating in the east coast of Malaysia in the state of Sabah.  They have taken hostages from that 
area and are a potential threat to Westerners and Western interests in the region.  Item 6, U.S. Department of State, Public Announcement, dated November 7, 
2003.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>In Executive Order 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (August 4, 1995), the President provided that eligibility for access to classified information 
shall be granted only to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of 
character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and 
willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  A person granted access to classified 
information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those 
individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of 
the applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in 
this case are: </P> 
<P>Guideline B - Foreign Influence:  A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that 
could result in the compromise of classified information.  Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1.</P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</P> 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, 
reliable information about the person. <EM> Id.</EM>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age 
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
<EM>Id.</EM>  <BR> 
</P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to 
classified information.  Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive, &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified 
information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive, &para; E2.2.2. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR. </P> 
<P><STRONG>Family Members in a Foreign Country.</STRONG></P> 
<P>The Government's documentary matters and Applicant's admissions constitute substantial evidence of two disqualifying conditions under Guideline B of the 
Directive.  Paragraph E2.A2.1.2.1 of the Directive provides that it may be a disqualifying condition if "an immediate family member, or a person to whom the 
individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country."  "[T[here is a rebuttable presumption that a 
person has ties of affection for, and obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse."  ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at 
*8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).  Applicant travels to Malaysia to visit his spouse's family, and they maintain regular contact by telephone and e-mail.  I conclude 
his wife's parents and siblings in Malaysia are persons to whom Applicant has close ties of affection.  </P> 
<P>The substantial evidence is sufficient to raise security concerns under &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.  These circumstances "could create the potential for foreign influence that 
could result in the compromise of classified information."  Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mere possession of family ties with persons in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, automatically disqualifying . . . [it] does raise a prima facie security 
concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for the applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 at **33-34 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Where there is a potential for foreign influence, security concerns can be mitigated where it is determined that the family members or associates in question are 
not agents of a foreign power, and they are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between 
loyalty to the person involved and the United States.  Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.3.1.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant declares his relatives in Malaysia have no connection with the government there.  Item 5, <EM>supra</EM>, at 1.  However, he provides no information about 
what they do for a living or their associations or activities.  In the absence of more information, it is difficult to determine that Applicant's relatives are not 
agents of a foreign government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In determining whether relatives are vulnerable to exploitation, a judge should consider several factors, including the character of the government of the 
relevant foreign country.  Malaysia is a constitutional monarchy.  The United States has maintained friendly relations with Malaysia since its independence in 
1957.  The two countries have a record of cooperation in many areas, including trade and investment, defense, and counter-terrorism.  Malaysia is not a hostile 
country with interests inimical to the United States.  Of course, </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">nothing in Guideline B (Foreign Influence) indicates or suggests that it is limited to countries that are hostile to the United States.  The United States has a 
compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, 
regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel submitted Item 6, a Public Announcement from the State Department warning of threats to travelers from terrorists in the east coast of the 
alaysian state of Sabah.  Notably, the described threat arises from terrorist activity, not the government of Malaysia.  Moreover, the specific area of concern is 
on the east coast of the island of Borneo, and not on the Malayan Peninsula, where Applicant's relatives reside.  Therefore, these concerns about terrorist 
activity are not compelling.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Another significant factor is Applicant's vulnerability to duress.  Applicant's closest tie is with his wife, a citizen of Malaysia.  The relatives in issue are 
immediate family members of Applicant's spouse.  Applicant and his wife provide financial support to her family by furnishing a residence, visit Malaysia on 
occasion, and maintain regular telephone and e-mail contact.  This indicates a very close personal relationship with her family members.  Indeed, Applicant's 
wife has reservations about seeking citizenship in the United States when eligible, because she wants to maintain her passport in order to facilitate possible 
future visits to Malaysia.  Considering all the circumstances, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his close contacts with 
his relatives in Malaysia.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Financial Interests in a Foreign Country.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The substantial evidence also presents a disqualifying condition under &para; E2.A2.1.2.8 of the Directive, which arises when an applicant has a "substantial 
financial interest in a country . . . that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence."  Applicant's real-estate holdings in Malaysia are worth about 
$60,000.  This gives rise to security concerns under &para; E2.A2.1.2.8 of the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It may be a mitigating condition if foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities.  The real estate in 
alaysia belonging to Applicant and his wife represent 25% of their total net worth.  Although Applicant indicates he and his spouse could do without the real 
property, nonetheless a considerable financial interest remains.  Applicant is potentially vulnerable to governmental, corporate, or individual action against his 
assets.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial interests in a foreign country.</SPAN></P>
