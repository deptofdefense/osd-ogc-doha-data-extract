<P>        Applicant is 57 years old and has been married for nearly 31 years. His wife has been hospitalized 35 times due to mental illness in the past 20-25 years, 
and Applicant has incurred multiple debts for medical services provided to his wife not covered by his medical insurance. Applicant failed to disclose any 
delinquent debts on his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) in September 2002. In May 2005, he was granted Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief. Applicant 
successfully mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial difficulties and personal conduct. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On, January 19, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry, </EM>dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Review Program, </EM>dated January 
2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the 
Directive under Guideline F - Financial Considerations, and Guideline E - Personal Conduct. The SOR detailed why DOHA could not preliminarily determine 
under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's request for a security clearance. By his answer executed 
February 2, 2005, Applicant admitted with explanations the allegations of SOR subparagraphs 1.a - 1.h., 1.j., and 1.l. through 1.aa., and denied the allegations 
of subparagraphs 1.i., 1.k., and 2.a. - 2.b., and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on July 11, 2005, and I conducted the hearing on July 26, 2005. The government submitted exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were 
admitted without objection. Applicant testified at the hearing along with two other witnesses on his behalf, and offered exhibits (AE) A through C, and E 
through H, also admitted without objection. Applicant's exhibit AE D was offered, but not admitted. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 5, 
2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<P>Applicant owes the following amounts to the creditors referenced in the SOR:</P> 
<P>1. Medical bill for his wife - $149.00. (Subpara. 1.c.)</P> 
<P>2. Medical bill for his wife - $194.00. (Subpara. 1.d.)</P> 
<P>3. Medical bill for his wife - $600.00. (Subpara. 1.e.)</P>

<P>11. Medical bill for his wife - $991.00. (Subpara. 1.m.)</P> 
<P>12. Medical bill for his wife - $728.00. (Subpara. 1.n.)</P> 
<P>13. Medical bill for his wife - $1,053.00. (Subpara. 1.o.)</P> 
<P>14. Medical bill for his wife - $350.00. (Subpara. 1.p.)</P> 
<P>15. Medical bill for his wife - $112.00. (Subpara 1.q.)</P> 
<P>16. Medical bill for his wife - $212.00. (Subpara. 1.r.)</P>

<P>24. Medical bill for his wife - $72.00. (Subpara 1.z.)</P> 
<P>25. Medical bill for his wife - $59.00. (Subpara. 1.aa.)</P> 
<P>Of Applicant's total debt, as set forth above, of $22,434.13, $14,820.13 is directly related to medical bills incurred on behalf of his wife, but not covered by the 
medical insurance he provides for her through his employment.<A HREF="03-16930.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>When Applicant submitted his personal financial statement to a Defense Security Service (DSS) investigator on May 13, 2003, he and his wife owned no 
significant personal assets. He further showed positive income of $636.00 per month.<A HREF="03-16930.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> This monthly net calculation accounted for $397.00 each month he was 
paying at the time against a few selected smaller debts, but did not include the payment he could not make for over $1000.00 per month he owed for the 
monthly mortgage payment on the family home that was then in default. The home was later sold through foreclosure at a deficiency.<A HREF="03-16930.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> Applicant's remaining 
debts were subject to the bankruptcy case he subsequently initiated in January 2005, leading to a Chapter 7 discharge entered in the case in May 2005.<A HREF="03-16930.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant signed his SF 86 on September 3, 2002. As to Questions 38 and 39 regarding existing debt delinquencies over 90 and 180 days, Applicant failed to 
list any delinquent secured or unsecured debts. He maintains he did not list any debts in response to the questions because he did not fully comprehend the 
questions and he was unclear as to the status of all of his debts at the time.<A HREF="03-16930.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> He was also planning to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief at the time, further 
complicating specific assessment of his numerous debts that might become subject to his proposed payment plan with the bankruptcy trustee. When Applicant 
later met with the DSS investigator on May 13, 2003, he did not dispute the credit information presented to him and acknowledged some 25 debts on his 
financial statement. He openly and candidly discussed with the investigator the nature of the debts and the facts and circumstances over many years that 
contributed to the financial distress of the family.<A HREF="03-16930.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Enclosure 2 of the Directive,<EM> Adjudicative Guidelines For Determining Eligibility For Access To Classified Information,</EM> sets forth the criteria which must be 
evaluated when determining security clearance eligibility.<STRONG> </STRONG>The adjudicative guidelines specifically distinguish between those factors that are considered in 
denying or revoking an employee's request for access to classified<STRONG> </STRONG>information (Disqualifying Conditions), together with those factors that are considered in 
granting an employee's request for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions). By acknowledging that individual circumstances of each case are 
always different,<STRONG> </STRONG>the guidelines provide substantive standards to assist an administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
<P>The adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable information about the applicant, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, to arrive at well- informed decisions. Section E2.2. of Enclosure 2 of the Directive describes the essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in 
a case as the "whole person concept."<STRONG> </STRONG>In evaluating the conduct of the applicant and the circumstances in any case, the factors an administrative judge should 
consider pursuant to the concept are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of the participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
<P>Protecting national security is the paramount concern in reaching a decision in any case, and is dependent upon the primary standard that issuance of a clearance 
must be clearly consistent with the interests of national security. Granting an applicant's clearance for access to classified information is predicated on a high 
degree of trust and confidence in the individual. Accordingly, decisions under the Directive must include consideration of not just the <EM>actual </EM>risk of disclosure 
of such information, but also consideration of any <EM>possible </EM>risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently compromise classified information in any aspect 
of his or her life. Any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting classified 
information.<A HREF="03-16930.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> The decision to deny a security clearance request to an individual is not necessarily a determination of the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="03-16930.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> It is merely 
an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines established by the Department of Defense for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>In accordance with the Directive, the government bears the burden of proof in the adjudicative process to first establish conditions by substantial evidence 
which indicate it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.<A HREF="03-16930.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> The legal standard for 
the burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="03-16930.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> When the government meets this burden, the corresponding heavy burden of 
rebuttal then falls on the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the position of the 
government, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance.<A HREF="03-16930.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Under Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant delinquent debts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having 
to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides 
an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. </P> 
<P>Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations), </EM>and 
E2.A6.1.2.3 <EM>(Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), </EM>apply in this case. I have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), 
and specifically considered FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 <EM>(The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a</EM> <EM>business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), </EM>and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 <EM>(The individual initiated a good 
faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts)</EM>. I conclude both apply to this case.</P> 
<P>Applicant has endured significant personal hardship and adversity during the course of his 31-year marriage. The circumstances surrounding his wife's mental 
illness have persisted for at least the last 25 years, exemplified by the fact she has been hospitalized 35 times. Applicant successfully held the family together 
during these stressful events, and ostensibly raised the parties' four children with marginal contribution from his wife. In addition to her medical bills, his wife's 
lifestyle and poor judgment also, at times, contributed to the family's very difficult financial situation.<A HREF="03-16930.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>While Applicant's resources over the years have been inadequate to maintain his family's financial security, he has endeavored to the best of his ability to 
maintain his personal dignity and self respect by often working two jobs and regularly paying back personal debts to people who provided limited financial 
assistance to him from time to time.<A HREF="03-16930.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> Applicant is admired by people closest to him for having stayed with his wife for many years under extremely difficult 
circumstances, "for better or for worse."<A HREF="03-16930.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant has continually attempted to address his oppressive debts over the course of the marriage. While it is clear most of the debt has never been satisfied 
through payment, he has resorted to proper legal means to resolve his debts on three occasions by initiating bankruptcy court proceedings. The most recent 
discharge of debt granted to him by the court in May 2005, should have long range positive consequences. Applicant's wife has now applied for social security 
disability benefits which appears forthcoming, and will likely provide significant medical and other resources to her not otherwise available in the past. She no 
longer resides with Applicant, and with divorce of the parties now imminent, Applicant is postured to avoid the same pattern of events which followed the relief 
granted in his previous two bankruptcies.</P> 
<P>Personal Conduct under Guideline E is a security concern because it questions whether or not a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be 
trusted to properly safeguard classified information in the future. Personal Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, I have considered all the Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC), and, specifically, PC DC E2.A5.1.2.2. <EM>(The deliberate 
omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material </EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form 
used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or 
award fiduciary responsibilities). </EM>I conclude none apply in this case<EM>.</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was certainly aware he had delinquent debts and failed to list any of them when he completed his SF 86 in September 2002. The omissions regarding 
his significant debts were misleading. Upon first observation, it is reasonable to suspect Applicant considered such omissions to be relevant and material to a 
security investigation that could result in an unfavorable decision, demonstrating possible dishonesty.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Nevertheless, Applicant credibly testified he did not fully understand the time element (90 and 180 days) when considering Questions 38 and 39, to be able to 
conclude just when overdue debts are actually determined to be delinquent for credit purposes. He candidly admits he did not know the complete status of all 
his debts, having been granted debt discharge relief in two prior bankruptcy matters. It does not logically follow Applicant would attempt to hide his very 
significant financial problems of the past which spanned 20 years or more and two U.S. Bankruptcy cases. He disclosed his 1999 bankruptcy case on his SF 86 
as required.<A HREF="03-16930.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> Without question, he did not diligently determine the status of his debts or consider the questions more carefully, but his failure to do so was not 
intentional. When requested, he openly discussed all his debts with the investigator. Under the circumstances of this case, I find Applicant's testimony 
reasonable and credible, and his omissions were not made deliberately. Accordingly, PC DC E2.A5.1.2.2. does not apply in this case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the evidence in this case including Applicant's credibility and demeanor. I have also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating 
Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting national interests. Applicant's loyalty to the United States is not in question. The government's primary concern 
in this case is whether or not Applicant may resort to illegal or unethical activities to generate funds. To the contrary, Applicant has led an exemplary life over 
the last 25 years he has faced substantial financial adversity. I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence that it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant Applicant a security clearance. For the reasons stated, Applicant has fully mitigated the security concerns regarding the financial and personal conduct 
issues raised in this case. Accordingly, Guideline F and Guideline E raised by the government are decided for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
