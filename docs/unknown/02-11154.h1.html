<P>Applicant has a history of financial difficulties.  In 2002, he owed 12 creditors approximately $13,000.  Two years later, he had made little progress in resolving 
his debts despite his assurances and apparent ability to do so.  Applicant has failed to mitigate security concerns raised by these debts due to his inability or 
unwillingness to resolve them.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On September 29, 2003, DOHA issued 
a Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-11154.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  Applicant answered 
the SOR in writing on October 28, 2003, and elected to have a hearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to me on January 7, 2004.  On 
January 23, 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government offered five documents, which were admitted without objection as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5.  The Applicant offered one 
document, which was admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A.  I left the record open to afford Applicant the opportunity to submit additional 
documents.  The Applicant timely submitted eight additional documents, which were admitted without objection as AE B through I.  DOHA received the 
transcript on February 3, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 36-year-old employee for a defense contractor.  He is married with four children living at home.  He has been with his current employer since 
September 2001.  Applicant's wife is employed as a beautician.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant served in the U. S. Navy from October 1988 to March 1998, and was honorably discharged as a Storekeeper Second Class Petty Officer, pay grade E-5.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleged Applicant owed 12 creditors a total of $13,501.00, as of January 10, 2002.  Applicant admitted 10 of the 12 debts were valid.  Those 10 
admitted debts total $12,705.00.  Applicant denied one of debts totaling $568.00 (&para; 1.h) indicating it was a duplicate debt (&para; 1.b) already alleged, and denied a 
second debt totaling $228.00 (&para; 1.I), which had been deleted from Applicant's credit report.  Answer to SOR.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted a signed, sworn statement on January 28, 2002.  GE 2.  In that statement, he said, "I intend to pay off one debt at a time.  I intend to start 
with my lowest debt and make payments to that financial company until that debt is paid off and then go to the next debt and so on.  I hope to have all 
delinquent debts paid off within the next two years."  GE 2, p. 2.  At the time, Applicant submitted this statement, his accompanying financial statement 
reflected a net monthly remainder of $236.00.  Applicant stated, "I intend to use $236.00 monthly remainder to begin to pay off my delinquent debts."  GE, p. 4.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the two years that have elapsed between Applicant's statement and the date of his hearing, he has settled one account of $532.00 (&para; 1.k) for a lesser amount 
of $361.33, and settled a second account of $376.00 (&para; 1.l) for a lesser amount of $250.00.  AE A, AE B.  These settlements occurred in January 2004, the same 
month as his hearing.  Of the remaining debts, Applicant has paid $25.00 to $50.00 on each account in the two year period from the time of his signed, sworn 
statement to his hearing.  He estimates he owes approximately $12,000.00 to $15,000.00 to his creditors, reflecting an increased debt amount as a result of 
accruing interest.  Tr. 33, 37, 38.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to his decreased salary when he was discharged from the U. S. Navy, reduction of his wife's income due to loss of 
clients as a beautician, and several brief periods of unemployment.  GE 3, pgs. 3-4.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His plan to recover from his financial dilemma is to sell his townhouse, which he estimates  has over $100,000.00 in equity, and use that money to pay off his 
debts.  Once sold, he plans to rent, then purchase a home when financially solvent.  Tr. 17, 38, 44.  No documentation was offered verifying this plan.  
Applicant has not sought the assistance of a financial counselor, but has sought the advice of his realtor/lender, who attends his church.  It was the lender's 
suggestion to sell his townhouse.  Tr. 43.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure (2) of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F- Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had delinquent debts (&para;&para; 1.a.-1.l.) totaling more than $13,000.00.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk 
of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions SOR allegations &para;&para; 1.a.-1.g., 1.j.-1.l.  The debts alleged in &para;&para; 1.k. and 1.l. have 
been settled for a lesser amount.  Applicant denied the debt alleged in &para; 1.h. , which is a duplicate of the debt alleged in &para; 1.b.  Applicant also denied the debt 
alleged in &para; 1.i., which has been deleted from his credit report.  Applicant still owes his creditors approximately $12,000.00 to $15,000.00, and his financial 
situation has worsened in the two year period from the time he submitted his signed, sworn statement until his hearing.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His recent attempts to pay off his creditors have fallen far short of what would be expected of someone who was put on notice by the Government in January 
2002 of the security ramifications of his debts.  His assurances to pay off these debts has been disappointing as well as his bare minimum effort to rectify his 
financial situation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DCs applicable: DC 1: A history of not meeting financial obligations. E2.A6.1.2.1.; DC 3:  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.  E2.A6.1.2.3.  MCs 
applicable: None.  I conclude Guideline F against Applicant, however, I conclude for him on &para;&para; 1.h., 1.i., 1.k. and 1.l.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In short, at the time of Applicant's hearing, he had not demonstrated he had taken the necessary steps to resolve or attempt to resolve his financial difficulties.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1.  Guideline F:  AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.a.-1.g: Against Applicant</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is denied.</SPAN></P>
