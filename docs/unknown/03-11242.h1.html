<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 7, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on April 14, 2003. Applicant requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 30, 2003, this case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on September 9, 
2003, and the hearing was held on September 30, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 4) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered three documentary 
exhibits (Exhibits A - C) and offered his own testimony. After the hearing, the record was left open. Department Counsel offered two documentary exhibits, a 
Security Clearance Application (SCA) of Applicant from July 1985, consisting of 3 pages, and a statement of Applicant, dated November 1985, consisting of 
five pages (Exhibits 5 and 6). Applicant offered two documentary exhibits, a letter from his facility security officer, and a Receipt for Application for 
Naturalization, each consisting of one page (Exhibits D and E). There were no objections to any of the documents, and they have been entered into evidence. 
The transcript (Tr) was received on October 15, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Applicant indicated that his last name was not been spelled correctly on the SOR.  The SOR was amended to reflect the correct spelling, and this 
decision also reflects that correction.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B of the Directive (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct). In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits the three allegations under Guideline B (1.a., 1.b., and 1.c.), and he denies the allegations 
under Guideline E (2.a., 2.b., and 2.c.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon 
due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 51 year old employee of a defense contractor. He </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was born in Iran in 1951, moved to the United States in 1970, and became a naturalized United 
States citizen in 1984. He first came to the United States to pursue an education. He has received Masters Degrees in nuclear engineering and quality assurance 
and management, and he will soon be receiving a Ph.D. degree,</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">all from  United States universities. He has held a security clearance without interruption since 1986.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since Applicant emigrated to the United States, he traveled to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Iran</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> on one occasion in 1979 (Tr at 51). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is an Iranian citizen, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">who has lived in the United States for approximately 12 years and is in the process of becoming a United States citizen.  
At the time of the hearing, Applicant's wife was pregnant with their first child.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's older sister, brother-in-law, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and their daughter </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">are citizens of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Iran. They reside in a home that they purchased in the United States, and all three are 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in the process of becoming United States citizen</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">s.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Neither his sister or brother-in-law ever worked for the Iranian government (Tr at 32-33). Applicant's 
younger sister and brother are citizens of and reside in the United States (Tr at 33, 34). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified that he has voted in every election since he became a naturalized United States citizen </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Transcript at 44).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> When he was given </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the 
hypothetical question </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> as to what he would do if the Iranian Government threatened  his family if he did not cooperate, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified  that he would never 
betray the United States (Tr at 56, 57)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Since there has been no actual set of circumstances that occurred similar to the hypothetical fact pattern, I can not give 
his statement a great deal of consideration. ISCR Case No. 02-26826 (November 12, 2003). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, I believe that his testimony was credible.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>When Applicant completed a signed, sworn<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> SCA</SPAN> on August 10, 2000, he failed to list information on question <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">#9 </SPAN>concerning his sister and her husband who, at 
the time, were <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">citizens of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and resided part time in Iran.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>When Applicant completed a signed, sworn<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> SCA</SPAN> on December 20, 2001, on question <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">#9, </SPAN>he<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> only furnished his younger sister's address in the United States as 
the address to contact his older sister, who still resided part time in Iran. </SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testified that his older sister and her husband had sold their home in Iran, and 
the only address he could furnish for her at that time was that of his younger sister in the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">           Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative 
Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Each 
adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular 
condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, etc. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2. Condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.3. Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.3.1. A determination that the immediate family member(s). . . in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.1. <EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. The following will normally result in an unfavorable 
clearance action or administrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2. Condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security 
clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3. Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3.2. The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily.<STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to guidelines B and E:</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of foreign influence. 
Applicant's immediate family members including his wife, sister, and brother in-law are citizens of Iran. The Iranian citizenship of members of Applicant's 
immediate family create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially 
vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in 
rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A>or continue a 
security clearance for him. ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As Applicant's immediate family members are citizens of Iran, a country which is undisputedly hostile to the Government of the United States, Applicant has a 
very heavy burden of showing that these family members do not pose a security risk. ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (October 16, 2002).   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence of existence of immediate family members, who are citizens of Iran, comes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1.  However, I have also 
considered the following: Applicant's wife, sister, and brother-in-law now </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">reside in the United States, and all three are </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in the process of becoming United States 
citizen</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">s;</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> there has been no Iranian government involvement of Applicant's family members; he has no immediate family members who will be residing in Iran; 
Applicant has established a successful career and family since coming to the United States more than 30 years ago; and he gave extremely strong testimony 
about his feelings concerning the United States and what he would do if faced with a threat from a foreign government. Based on the nature of this overall 
record, I have determined that his family members do not constitute an unacceptable security risk, and Mitigating Condition (MC) 1 applies. Guideline B is 
found for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>After considering all of the evidence of record on these issues, I conclude that the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the SOR 
and even in the unlikely event pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would resist it, and would  report the incident to 
the proper authorities. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided incomplete information to the Government in response to one question <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">on the 
SCA that he executed in August 2000,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and </SPAN>one question <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">on the SCA that he executed in December 2001. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude that Applicant did not knowingly provide untruthful or incorrect information. Applicant testified that, because of the software he was using, he had 
considerable difficulty inputting information into the computer to complete these SCAs, and that was the reason for the incomplete information (TR at 35-29). 
For the following reasons, I conclude that this explanation is reasonable: A letter form Applicant's Facility Security Officer confirmed that Applicant had 
problems with the software for inputting his SCA (Exhibit D), and in an earlier statement, made in 1985 to the Defense Security Service, Applicant had already 
identified that his mother and two sisters resided in Iran (Exhibit 5). Finally, on the SCA, Applicant did not even identify his brother and other sister, who reside 
in and are citizens of the United States. This information benefits Applicant, and there would be no reason for him not to include this information, but for his 
difficulties with the software. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I resolve Guideline E for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E,  I conclude that no DC applies because the incomplete information that Applicant provided 
in his SCA was not made wilfully.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Accordingly, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns, thereby demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant him a security 
clearance.</SPAN></P>
