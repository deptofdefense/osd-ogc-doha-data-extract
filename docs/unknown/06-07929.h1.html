<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Forty-four-year-old Applicant had fourteen financial allegations listed in the SOR. </SPAN>She failed to adequately explain, controvert, or show how she planned to resolve or pay six debts, including two 
debts together totaling over $13,000.00. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> She was unemployed from June 2003 to June 2004, which aggravated her financial problems.  She has failed to mitigate concerns about financial

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On May 5, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(e-QIP).<A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On July 11, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended 
and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.<A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The 
SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn, notarized answer, dated August 7, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, electing to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.<A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  A complete copy of 
the file of relevant material (FORM), (cover letter dated September 7, 2006), was provided to her on September 15, 2006, and she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material 
in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.<A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Any such submissions were due by October 15, 2006.<A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Applicant did not provide additional materials in response to the FORM.  The case was assigned 
to me on October 25, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL RULING</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On September 5, 2006, Department Counsel made a motion seeking judicial notice of the Equifax Training Brochure (Item 12).  Department Counsel's motion for judicial notice is denied.  
Administrative or official notice, rather than judicial notice, is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing 
ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004); <EM>McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service</EM>, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)).  The most common basis for administrative notice 
at ISCR proceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or from government reports. <EM>See</EM> Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender &amp; Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for 
administrative notice).  Applicant has not objected to the admissibility of Item 12, and it is admitted to explain the codes in the Equifax Credit Reports that are part of the record evidence (Items 9-11).</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations, Applicant made some admissions, and denied other allegations in her response to the SOR.<A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  Under 
Guideline F, the SOR listed a total of 14 debts.  Applicant admitted that she was aware of and responsible for nine debts, that were delinquent for at least a year.  The delinquent SOR debts are listed 
in SOR &para;&para; 1.b, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j to 1.n.  </P> 
 
<P>In her response to the SOR, Applicant asserted two of the fourteen SOR debts (SOR &para;&para;  1.a and 1.i) were the responsibility of Applicant's  husband and resulted from his business.  She denied the 
SOR debt in &para; 1.e) without elaboration.  Two SOR debts were paid by garnishment orders (SOR &para;&para;  1.c and 1.d).<A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  I find her statements contradicting the debts in SOR &para;&para;  1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.i to be 
credible.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 44-year-old<A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> employee of a defense contractor.<A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Her current employer has  employed her for seven of the preceding nine years.<A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  From June 2003 to June 2004, she was 
unemployed, and from June 2004 to March 2005 she was employed by a temporary employment agency.<A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Applicant has no prior military service.<A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  From September 1982 to April 1983, she 
attended college, but was not awarded a degree.<A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant was married on August 8, 1992</SPAN>.<A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  Applicant has two children, and four stepchildren.<A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record does not contain an interview by a security investigator.  There is no personal financial statement in the record.  In response to the SOR, Applicant made a brief statement indicating that 
some of her debts are her husband's business debts.<SUP>17</SUP>  The medical bills that went into collection were paid off through the garnishment of her pay.<SUP>19</SUP></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In an evaluation of an applicant's security suitability, an administrative judge must consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant's eligibility 
for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive. An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.  Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at 
E2.2.1 of the Directive: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency 
of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations - Guideline F: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.  Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.1.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed 
in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates, in 
accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. If the government meets its initial burden, 
applicant then has the burden of persuasion, that is to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and 
ultimately to demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue applicant's clearance.<A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty 
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect 
or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>The scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically 
provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance 
decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. </SPAN> Applicant's initial failure to pay her debts is of concern, especially in light of her desire to have access to the nation's secrets.  Under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), "[a]n individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds."  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who fails 
or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  FC DC 1 applies where an applicant has a history of not 
meeting his or her financial obligations.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.1.  FC DC 3 applies where an applicant has exhibited inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's 
actions in initially failing to satisfy her outstanding financial obligations give rise to FC DC 1 and 3.  Applicant admitted she was responsible for all of the debts listed in the SOR, except for &para;&para; 1.a, 
1.e, and 1.i.<A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  She did not indicate why her debts became delinquent. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated by substantial evidence under FC MCs 1 or 2 that "the behavior was not recent" or "it was an isolated incident."  Directive &para;&para; 
E2.A6.1.3.1, E2.A6.1.3.2.  I considered FC MC 1 and 2, but concluded that neither mitigating condition fully applied because there are six debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.b, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.k, and they 
have not been paid, and are not in the process of being resolved. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant disclosed some information to support consideration of FC MC 3, "the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a 
business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)."  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.3.  However, her financial difficulties remain largely unexplained.  She was 
unemployed from June 2003 to June 2004, and she </SPAN>was  employed by a temporary employment agency from June 2004 to March 2005.<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Her security clearance questionnaire indicates that she was 
gainfully employed for seven of the last nine years.  Although unemployment or underemployment may have caused her financial problems, she has not provided enough information about changes 
in her financial situation, with linkage to the generation of her delinquent debts to warrant full application of FC MC 3.</SPAN><A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">FC MC 6 can mitigate a security concern arising from financial problems</SPAN> when "the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts," <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(FC MC 6).  
Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.6.  The Appeal Board has defined the concept of good faith, as requiring "</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence 
to duty or obligation."  ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004). </SPAN>FC MC 6 does not fully apply because there is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith 
in the resolution of her debts.  Applicant has not provided any information about how she attempted to resolve or repay the <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">six debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.b, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.k</SPAN>.           </P>

<P>In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under Directive <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">provision E2.2.1. As 
noted above, Applicant's failure to make progress resolving six SOR debts, including two </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR debts in &para;&para; 1.f and 1.h, respectively for $6,244.00 and $$7,679.00</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> are a serious, ongoing, long-term 
problem and are sufficiently serious to be a security concern.  E2.2.1.1.  Her actions were knowledgeable and voluntary.  E2.2.1.2.<SUP></SUP>  She is 44 years old, sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for 
her conduct.  E2.2.1.4.<SUP></SUP>  The likelihood of recurrence cannot yet be determined because insufficient evidence was presented about improvement in her financial situation, and  corroborating evidence 
of change is sparse.  E2.2.1.9. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> There is little evidence of her job performance.  The absence of evidence of any prior security violation weighs in her favor.  There is a paucity of supporting evidence 
about rehabilitation.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has not </SPAN>mitigated the security 
concerns pertaining to financial considerations.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence leaves me with grave questions and doubts as to Applicant's security eligibility and suitability. I take this position based on the law, as set forth in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan,</EM> 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), my "careful consideration of the whole person factors"<SUP><A HREF="06-07929.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of 
my  responsibilities under Enclosure 2 of the Directive. Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government's case. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</P>
