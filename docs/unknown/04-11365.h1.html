<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On July 19, 2005, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 
20, 1960, as amended and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged 
security concerns under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E, Personal Conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">August 12, 2005</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on February 17, 
2006. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A notice of hearing was issued on March 8, 2006, scheduling the hearing for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">March 30, 2006.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The hearing was conducted on that date. The government 
submitted three exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1-3 and admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and 
submitted six exhibits which were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-F and admitted without objection. After the hearing, he submitted one exhibit that was 
marked as AE G and admitted without objection.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 10, 2006.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his SOR response, Applicant admits the allegations in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.c but denies the allegation in 1.b. Applicant's admissions are incorporated 
herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 35-year-old computer integrator with a Department of Defense contractor.  He is single and has no children.  From 1991 to November 2003, he 
was in the Air Force Reserves.  In October 2001, he was called to active duty for ten months.  From March 2002 to May 2002, he deployed to a location in the 
iddle East.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  He separated from the Reserves at the rank of Technical Sergeant (E-6).<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He has worked for his current employer since May 12, 2003.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  He has 
held a SECRET clearance for over 14 years.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 1995, Applicant met a woman who would become his future girlfriend.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  She was an Iranian citizen who was in the United States illegally after her 
temporary work visa expired.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Applicant was aware of his girlfriend's illegal status.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Between October 1995 to June 2002, they dated on a sporadic basis.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  In 
June 2002, they began dating more seriously.  At the time, Applicant lived in another city and would travel to where his girlfriend lived approximately once a 
month.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  At his girlfriend's urging, he eventually found a job in the city where his girlfriend resided.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 15, 2003, Applicant submitted a security clearance application as part of a requirement for employment with his current employer.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  He did not list his 
girlfriend on his security clearance application.  In mid May 2003, Applicant moved to the city where his girlfriend resided and started the job with his current 
employer.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  In June 2003, he moved in with his girlfriend and her eight-year-old daughter.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 29, 2003, Applicant submitted a security clearance application for a TOP SECRET clearance.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  He did not list his girlfriend or her daughter on 
this application.  Although he acknowledges that the security questionnaire asked if he had a spouse-like relationship with someone he is living with, he claims 
that he did not think that his relationship with his girlfriend was that far along to be considered spouse-like.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  He also admits that he knew his security clearance 
would be in question due to this relationship.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In November 2003, Applicant was interviewed by a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service during his background investigation.  During the interview, 
he disclosed that he was living with his girlfriend and her daughter and that they were Iranian citizens.  He was asked to provide additional information about 
his girlfriend's status and he refused.  His girlfriend refused to cooperate and he made a decision to respect her wishes, in part, because he was afraid the INS 
would be contacted.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At one point, Applicant approached his site manager and his project manager to inquire about postponing the adjudication of his TOP SECRET status until his 
girlfriend's citizenship issues were resolved.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  He was told there was no way to postpone the process.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In February 2004, Applicant and his girlfriend broke up. His girlfriend and her daughter moved out of the apartment.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  After the breakup, Applicant called the 
Defense Security Service and set up an additional interview. He initially requested to have his relationship with his former girlfriend stricken from the record.  
He was told the information could not be removed so he requested an additional interview.  He was interviewed on March 17, 2004.  During this interview, he 
provided his former girlfriend's social security number and indicated that he has no intentions of continuing his relationship with her.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  He decided to provide 
the information about his former girlfriend because he was worried about his career and wanted to make amends for not having done so in the beginning.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He admits to not being completely forthcoming about his relationship with his former girlfriend because he knew it would be an issue during his security 
clearance background investigation.  He did not list her on his security clearance application intentionally as a means to avoid the situation until her security 
clearance status was rectified.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He and his girlfriend had planned to marry so that she could acquire legal status in the United States.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  He discovered that he 
could not get a marriage license until his girlfriend obtained her husband's death certificate. Her husband died in Iran in 2002.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  In response to the SOR and at 
hearing, Applicant testified he had no intentions of marrying his girlfriend.  He was just looking into future possibilities.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's site manager/facility security officer provided a statement on his behalf.  He has worked with him since May 2003 and is impressed with Applicant's  
professionalism, strong work ethic, and honesty.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  His supervisor from May 2003 to October 2005, indicates he was highly professional and always helped 
other employees who needed assistance. He was the "go to" guy for solving tough problems.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> Several other co-workers and friends submitted letters on his 
behalf indicating he is a loyal friend and a dedicated and reliable worker.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is currently involved with another woman who is a U.S. citizen.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> He states he has learned from the mistakes he made in the past.  He hopes to prove 
he is a trustworthy and reliable person.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently

Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this 
case is: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Guideline E, Personal Conduct:  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable information 
about the person.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A> <BR> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by 
the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A>  Any 
doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for 
issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's refusal to provide additional information about his live-in girlfriend  to a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service supports the application of 
Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.1.2: (<EM>Refusal to complete required security forms, releases, or provide full, frank and truthful 
answers to lawful questions of investigators, security officials or other official representatives in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness 
determination</EM>).  The Special Agent's questions about his foreign national girlfriend were lawful and pertinent to a determination of  his security-worthiness. 
Applicant acknowledges that he was aware that his relationship with his girlfriend would cause security concerns.  He refused to cooperate because he chose to 
respect his girlfriend's wishes rather than disclose information that was relevant to his security background investigation.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>PC DC E2.A5.1.2.2:  (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal 
history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>) applies with respect to Applicant deliberately failing to list his live-in girlfriend on his 
security clearance application dated September 29, 2003.  He admits that he intentionally left her name off his security clearance application as a means to avoid 
the situation until her citizenship status was rectified.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since Applicant was not living with his girlfriend when he submitted his first security clearance application dated April 14, 2003, he had no duty to list on her 
on his security clearance application. He did have a duty to list her on his September 29, 2003, security clearance application since he was living with her 
despite his recent claims that he did not consider the relationship "spouse-like."  I do not find his claims that he believed the relationship was not spouse-like 
credible since he initially indicated that he planned to marry her so she could become a legal immigrant. He also had looked into what was required to get a 
marriage license.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The personal conduct concern can be mitigated.  I find that none of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Concerns (PC MC) apply.  Applicant exercised extremely 
poor judgment when he refused to cooperate with the DSS agent conducting his background investigation.  He decided that his personal preferences were more 
important than his duty to be completely forthright and honest during his background investigation.  His conduct raises issues pertaining to his judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness.  His refusal to cooperate indicates an unwillingness to follow procedures if it might have an adverse impact on his personal life.  
Such conduct raises questions about whether he would be willing to follow procedures for safeguarding classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has served in the Air Force Reserves for over 12 years and held a security clearance  for the entire time.  He was an experienced and mature adult at 
the time he refused to cooperate during his background investigation.  His experience as an Air Force reservist should have given him greater insight as to the 
importance of cooperating in security background investigations.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His decision to cooperate after he and his girlfriend broke up does not mitigate his initial refusal to cooperate.  His decision to cooperate was not so much a 
change of heart but rather a change of situation. If an Applicant refuses to cooperate during a security background investigation, it normally results in an 
unfavorable clearance action.<A HREF="04-11365.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A>  Applicant's refusal to cooperate raises doubts about his ability to protect classified information.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He has not mitigated the 
personal conduct security concern. I find against him with respect to Guideline E.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept.  Despite Applicant's favorable recommendations from friends and co-workers, I conclude that his refusal to cooperate during his background investigation and his deliberate lack of candor on his September 29, 2003, security 
clearance application raises a sufficient security concern to make him ineligible for access to classified information. </SPAN></P>
