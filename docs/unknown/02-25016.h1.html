</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant has a history of gambling abuse manifested in accumulated debts exceeding $45,000.00 during an eight-year period in the 1990s, most of which he 
concealed from his wife at the time.  Acknowledging to himself that he had a gambling problem in 1999, he voluntarily enrolled in gamblers anonymous (GA) 
and tapped his 401k retirement fund for the necessary fund to repay his gambling and other debts. While Applicant has continued to gamble in local casinos, he 
has done so only occasionally, and never to abusive levels over the past five years. Combined with strong character references from persons who know him well 
at work, in his church, and in his community, Applicant successfully mitigates Government security concerns associated with his past gambling abuses.  
Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 15, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on January 30, 2004 and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on July 15, 2004, and was scheduled for hearing on 
August 11, 2004.  A hearing was convened on August 11, 2004, for the purpose of considering whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, 
continue, deny, or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of eight exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses 
(including himself) and 10 exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on August 20, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>.</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have (a) accumulated approximately $45,000.00 in gambling debts due to a gambling addiction, which he covered 
with funds withdrawn from his employer's performance sharing plan, (b) failed to make his wife aware of his previous gambling debts, &copy;) attended three 
gamblers anonymous (GA) meetings through his employer's employee assistance program for a gambling addiction in approximately 2002, and (d) continues to 
gamble one to two times monthly, as of May 2003, spending approximately $100.00 each time.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations except for his failing to make his wife aware of his previous gambling debts.   He 
claimed </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">his gambling losses were subsequently paid off with a hardship withdrawal from his 401k retirement plan that he used to repay other debts besides his 
gambling debts. He claims his wife knows he gambled and lost money, just not the extent of his losses.  He claimed to have taken up casino gambling in the 
early 1990s as a recreational outlet with his wife and elderly mother (since deceased).  And he claimed he now gambles occasionally, but on a much smaller 
scale that does not affect him financially.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 62-year-old senior engineer for a defense contractor who seeks to retain his  security clearance that he has held for 40 years (R.T., at 55).  The 
allegations covered in the SOR, and admitted to by Applicant, are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant participated regularly in casino gambling with his wife of 18 years and his elderly mother (since deceased) over an eight-year span in the 1990s.  By 
ay 1999 he had accumulated approximately $45,000.00 in gambling debts.  This information was furnished Applicant's facility security officer (FSO) in May 
1999 and is contained in an adverse information report on file with his employer (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3).   Applicant financed his gambling activity with his personal credit 
cards, none of which were ever delinquent (R.T., at 58).  While he didn't tell his wife initially about the extent of his gambling losses (around $45,000.00 in 
all),  he acknowledged her suspicions (<EM>see</EM> exs. 6 and 8).  Because Applicant has always paid most of the bills, his wife, an elementary school teacher who owns 
the house they live in (and pays only the house-related bills like the home mortgage, taxes, insurance and other personal debts) never knew the extent of credit 
card debt he ran up to support his gambling activities.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In August 2002, Applicant obtained a hardship withdrawal from his 401k performance plan.  With the net $96,000.00 in withdrawal funds he received (<EM>see</EM> ex. 
8), he paid off his personal loans, remaining gambling debts, and had enough left over to make down payments on two cars (<EM>see</EM> ex. A; R.T., at 62, 75-76).  At 
this time, he also told his wife everything about his gambling debts and payoffs (R.T., at 66-67).  He attributes the timing of his disclosures to his conscience, 
which had begun to bother him.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Believing at the time of his reconciliation of his accumulated gambling debts that he had a serious gambling addiction, Applicant attended several meetings 
with GA before concluding that he could better address his gambling problem himself (R.T., at 56-57).  He has never received professional psychological 
counseling for his past gambling abuses and doesn't believe that he has a gambling addiction at this time.  Applicant restricts his gambling to casual betting and 
assures he has no intention of ever again engaging in abusive gambling (R.T., at 64-65).  He maintains excellent credit and has not incurred any known debt 
delinquencies (<EM>see</EM> exs. B through G; R.T., at 51-53).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is considered to be honest and reliable by his supervisor, coworkers and friends who know and work with him (<EM>see</EM> exs. H and I; R.T., at 86-90).  His 
longstanding colleague and direct supervisor of two years describes Applicant as a person committed to the highest ideals of moral character, personal integrity, 
strong ethics, and high responsibility (ex. H).  Applicant has been an active member in his local college alumni association and is credited by a fellow alumnus 
and local chancery clerk with devoted efforts to his university and community and with being a man of integrity, a helpful friend, and a person he is proud to 
call a friend (<EM>see </EM>exs. H and I).  He has received group managers' awards in 1998 and 1999 recognizing his exceptional team efforts contributing to the 
successful completion of the company programs he was assigned (<EM>see</EM> ex. J).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1  Reliable unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 4   Personal conduct that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating conditions:</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 5  The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding 
that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the 
evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and 
materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the 
evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant accrued considerable legal gambling debts in the 1990s before taking a hardship withdrawal from his 401k performance plan in 2002 to pay off the 
debts.  Altogether, Applicant had incurred some $45,000.00 in legal gambling debts by May 1999 before realizing he had become addicted to gambling that he 
needed to address. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because Applicant's gambling debts did not create any undue financial burdens for him, security concerns over an applicant's financial condition are not 
present in this case.  What is of security significance is Applicant's self-described addiction to gambling in the past and the risk of recurrence of his addiction in 
light of the many years of active gambling.  To be sure, two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal conduct are 
applicable here: DC 1 (reliable unfavorable information) and DC 4 (personal conduct that increases the individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or 
duress).  Far more pertinent for assessing  security concerns over Applicant's gambling problems of the past, though, are the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the 
Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.  That Applicant gambled to self-described  abusive levels in the past and still gambles (although less frequently) 
preserves the need to consider the risk of recurrent addictive gambling behavior in the future.  Such recurrence risks create the potential for pressure or 
compromise, even for an applicant who has held a security clearance as long as he has.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Still, Applicant has never been diagnosed for gambling addiction and has no clinical diagnosis for any kind of gambling disorder.  Since he began participating 
in GA in 1999, he has limited  his gambling activities to occasional trips to the local casinos and has totally repaid his accumulated gambling debts with a large 
withdrawal from his 401k retirement plan.  Moreover, he has since fully disclosed the extent of his gambling debts to his wife, thereby eliminating any potential 
vulnerability to coercion or compromise from this source.  Important to balancing the risks of vulnerability associated with his gambling abuses is the strength 
of his  reputation for strong moral character with his company managers and coworkers, within his church, and in his community where he is known for his 
strong alumni and civic support.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant mitigates active security concerns associated with his gambling abuses by his acceptance of his problem, repayment of his accumulated gambling 
debts, informing of his wife, and his overall demonstration of good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness, both within and outside of his work place.  
Appraising Applicant's mitigation with respect to the judgment lapses associated with his past gambling abuses, Applicant may take advantage of MC 5 
(individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion or compromise) of the  Guidelines to mitigate his past 
gambling abuses.  He may also avail himself of the mitigation benefits covered by the E.2.2 factors for appraising an applicant's overall conduct and actions 
taken to reduce or eliminate risks of recurrence. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all of the circumstances of Applicant's history of gambling abuse and corrective steps he has taken to reduce or eliminate any recurrence 
risks, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d as to the allegations governed by the Adjudicative Guidelines pertinent to 
Guideline E.  </SPAN></P>
