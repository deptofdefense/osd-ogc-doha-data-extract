<P>	On February 10, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January
2, 1992, and amended by Change 3, February 16, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to
Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or
continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge
to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked. The SOR is attached. Applicant
filed his Answer to the SOR on March 5, 1997.</P>

<P>	The case was received by the undersigned on April 1, 1997. A notice of hearing was
issued on April 16, 1997, and the case was heard on May 8, 1997. The Government and
Applicant submitted documentary evidence. Testimony was taken from Applicant. The transcript
was received on May 19, 1997.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</U></STRONG>Before the end of the hearing, the record was kept open until May 28, 1997, to allow
Applicant an opportunity to submit additional documentation. No documentation was received.<STRONG><U>	</U></STRONG></P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Following Findings of Fact are based on the documentation and testimony. The SOR
alleges drug involvement, personal conduct and criminal conduct. Applicant admitted all the
factual allegations but noted under subparagraph 1f, that he stopped using crack cocaine in 1993
and not 1996 as alleged in the SOR. (TR 33) Applicant's admissions shall be incorporated into
the following Findings of Fact. </P>

<P>	On November 22, 1993, Applicant falsified his National Agency Questionnaire (DD
Form 398-2) when he answered "no" to question 20a, requesting information about any kind of
drug use. He also provided false information in response to question 20b when he answered in
the negative to purchasing drugs. </P>

<P>	Applicant also provided false information on August 15, 1996 (GE #3) when he stated he
only used marijuana until March 1996.<A HREF="97-0143.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> Also, Applicant furnished an incomplete picture on the
quantity of marijuana used, especially between 1993 and April 1996. Even after being confronted
with adverse information concerning an arrest for marijuana and other information about his drug
use, Applicant understated his marijuana use a second time and denied using any other drug. He
did say he began using marijuana in the middle 70s. He used the drug about once a week until
1985 when he stopped for 5 years. He resumed marijuana use in 1990 and used the drug weekly
until the positive drug test in March 1996, when he stopped using drugs altogether.</P>

<P>	In Exhibit 4 (December 3, 1996), Applicant furnished more detail about his marijuana
and other drug use. He used marijuana from 1972 to 1988 at a frequency of every weekend. He
paid about $50 a month on the drug. Applicant resumed marijuana use in 1990 and used the drug
four or five times a month until April 1996. He spent about $75 dollars a month on the drug.
Applicant began smoking crack cocaine in 1985. He mixed the crack with the marijuana and
smoked the combination (called 'Premo') about twice a month. The last time he smoked Premo
was in 1993. He spent about $40 a month on the crack and marijuana combination. Between
1973 and 1977, Applicant used "black beauties" sporadically.<A HREF="97-0143.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> Applicant was arrested in April
1994 for possession of marijuana. Although the charges were dropped due to lack of evidence,
Applicant had marijuana in his possession before his arrest, and cocaine was found on top of a
duffle bag in the rear seat of Applicant's car. Applicant continued to use marijuana after he was
granted a security clearance on June 15, 1994. On March 4, 1996, Applicant took a drug test
which produced positive results for marijuana. He was suspended for eleven days. Applicant
used marijuana on at least five occasions in the last three years during his lunch time hours, but,
never used the drug inside his workplace. (TR 39-40)  </P>

<P>	The --------------- manager has observed Applicant's good job performance as a
contributing member of the team. Applicant is dependable and his compliance with security
procedures has clearly improved. Applicant received a negative drug test on April 22, 1996.
Applicant's two additional drug tests since April 1996 have been negative also.</P>

<P>	Applicant stopped using drugs altogether because he does not want to lose his job and
drug use is bad for his health. (TR. 30)<A HREF="97-0143.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>  Applicant no longer associates with drug users because
he no longer uses drugs and has not used drugs for over a year. (TR. 37; 41)<A HREF="97-0143.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>  Applicant has been
a substitute teacher for about seven years. (TR. 53). </P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth policy factors which must be given binding
consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors must be considered in
every case according to the pertinent criterion; however, the factors are in no way <U>automatically</U>
<U>determinative</U> of the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's
reliance on his own common sense. Because each security case presents its own unique facts and
circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the entire realm of human
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. In addition, the Judge, as the trier of
fact, must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Factors most pertinent to
evaluation of the facts in this case are:</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Involvement (Criterion H)</CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P><U>Factors Against Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	1. any drug use.</P>

<P>	2. illegal drug possession,...purchase....</P>

<P><U>Factors for Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	None.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct (Criterion E)</CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P><U>Factors Against Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	1. the deliberate omission,...falsification of relevant and material facts from any personal
security questionnaire,...to...determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness....</P>

<P>	2. deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and
material matters to an investigator,...in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness
determination.</P>

<P><U>Factors for Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	None.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct (Criterion J)</CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P><U>Factors Against Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	1. any criminal conduct, regardless or whether the person was formally charged.</P>

<P><U>Factors for Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	None.</P>

<P>		<STRONG><CENTER>General Policy Factors (Whole Person Concept)</CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>Every security clearance case must also be evaluated under additional policy factors that
make up the whole person concept. Those factors (found at page 2-1 of Enclosure 2 of the
Directive) include: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances
surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or
absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; and,
(8) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	As set forth in the Directive, every personnel security determination must be a fair and
impartial overall commonsense decision based upon all available information, both favorable and
unfavorable, and must be arrived at by applying the standard that the granting (or continuance) of
a security clearance under this Directive may only be done upon a finding that to do so is clearly
consistent with the national interest. In reaching determinations under the Directive, careful
consideration must be directed to the actual as well as the potential risk involved that an
applicant may fail to properly safeguard classified information in the future. The Administrative
Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in
the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</P>

<P>	The Government must establish all the factual allegations under Criterion H (drug
involvement), Criterion E (personal conduct), and Criterion J (criminal conduct) which
establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. While a rational
connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to
effectively safeguard classified information, objective or direct evidence is not required.</P>

<P>	Then, the applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,
explanation, mitigation or extenuation which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is
unlikely to repeat itself and Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The Government has established a case of drug involvement that has not been mitigated
by Applicant. First, Applicant used marijuana for more than 20 years with only a brief hiatus
between 1988 and 1989. In the period between 1972 and 1988, Applicant used marijuana every
weekend. Between 1985 and 1988, he used marijuana in combination with cocaine at a frequency
of about twice a month. Additionally, he purchased marijuana on a regular basis until March
1996. He purchased cocaine on a regular basis, spending approximately $40 a month. Applicant
had marijuana in his possession when he was arrested in April 1994, and he continued to use
marijuana after receiving a security clearance in June 1994. Applicant's drug abuse resulted in a
suspension from his job in March 1996 after testing positive for marijuana. Finally, Applicant
lied about his drug use in November 1993 and August 1996. </P>

<P>	Applicant's drug abuse is not mitigated. His drug involvement was recent because he did
not stop using marijuana until March 1996. Before he stopped, his drug abuse was so serious that
he was suspended from work for eleven days for testing positive for marijuana. Although
Applicant states he has been drug free for a year and intends to remain drug free in the future,
Applicant's two previous falsifications undercut the credibility of his future intentions.
Furthermore, there is no evidence of any treatment or therapy that would provide some additional
justification to accept Applicant's stated intentions not to use drugs in the future.</P>

<P>	Applicant's two intentional falsifications of his drug use fall within the scope of Criterion
E. Applicant intentionally falsified a security form in November 1993 when he answered "no" to
the drug use and purchase questions. Applicant repeated his dishonest behavior in a sworn
statement in August 1996 when he intentionally provided an incomplete picture of his drug
history. Only when he was confronted with adverse information concerning an arrest for
marijuana possession in April 1994, did he eventually come forward four months later in
December 1996 with the full picture of his drug use.</P>

<P>	Deliberately providing false information on a security form and in a sworn statement,
raises serious doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. If an
applicant demonstrates poor judgment by providing false information during the course of the
security investigation, he is displaying strong signals to the Government he may not be able to
comply with security regulations at all times and in all places, particularly where compliance
with security rules presents adverse consequences to his own interests. For example, Applicant
failed to recognize the responsibilities of being a security clearance holder in April 1994 because
he continued to use drugs until March 1996.</P>

<P>	Applicant's intentional falsifications also represent criminal conduct under 18 USC 1001.<A HREF="97-0143.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A>
The intentional falsifications were recent because Applicant deliberately omitted material
information in his sworn statement of August 1996. Applicant's criminal conduct was not
isolated because he intentionally provided false information in November 1993, in addition to the
false information furnished in August 1996. There is not enough evidence of rehabilitation
because less than a year has passed since Applicant's last falsification and there is no evidence to
infer or even suggest that Applicant would have come forward with his entire drug history had he
not been confronted with additional, adverse facts about his drug use.</P>

<P>	The fact that Applicant finally came forward with the honest account of his drug history,
does not excuse he earlier falsifications. In addition, Applicant's claim he was trying to protect
his job or his clearance, does not forgive his dishonest conduct. Finally, there is no evidence
Applicant was unfairly or improperly advised by authorized personnel to provide false
information to the Government. </P>

<P>	Applicant's satisfactory job performance for the period ending in February 1997, and the
compliment from the -------- manager for being a team player, constitutes positive evidence in
Applicant's favor. However, Applicant's good character evidence is insufficient to outweigh the
long history of drug abuse and the pattern of dishonest conduct.</P>
