<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a history of delinquent debts accumulated during his marriage to his ex-spouse.  After dropping out of an initiated debt consolidation program in 
1995, Applicant and his spouse ignored their mostly joint debts until he was issued an SOR.  His most recent debt consolidation efforts are too incomplete and 
recent to provide the kind of repayment seasoning necessary to overcome raised financial concerns.  Further, he deliberately omitted his delinquent debts in his  
SF-86 and made no prompt, good faith corrections.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 21, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on March 18, 2003 and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on February April 21, 2003, 
and was scheduled for hearing to be held on May 8, 2003.  A hearing was convened on May 8, 2003, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of four 
exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses (including himself) and four exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on May 16, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the record with documentation of payment to creditors 1.c, 1.e, and 1.h, as well as the 
creditor 1.f/g accounts.  There being no objection from the Government, and good cause being shown, Applicant's request was granted.  Applicant was afforded 
7 days to supplement the record.  Government was granted 3 days to respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with a statement 
explaining his repayment efforts with creditors 1.c and 1.f/g and documented payment of his creditor 1.e and 1.h accounts.  Government interposed no 
objections to the admission of these exhibits.  These post-hearing submissions are admitted as Applicant's exhibits  E, F, and G, respectively.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 46-year old system field engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have incurred excessive indebtedness: Specifically, he is alleged to have accrued nine separate debts in delinquent 
status, exceeding $15,000.00 in the aggregate, which he has the means to discharge, after failed consolidation attempts.</P> 
 
<P>Additionally, Applicant is alleged under Guideline E to have falsified his security clearance application (SF-86) by omitting his delinquent debts over 180 days 
and 90 days, respectively.</P> 
 
<P>For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts attributed to him in the SOR, while claiming they were the responsibility of his ex-wife to discharge, 
save for the credit card account 1.a.  He claimed he and his ex-wife entered into a credit counseling program in 1995, but were forced to withdraw from the 
program when remaining would have prevented them from replacing their wrecked car.  Applicant claimed reduction in his available retirement earnings 
attributable to ordered alimony payments to his ex-wife.  He also claimed recent entry into a debt repayment program to address his old debts.  With respect to 
his SF-86 omissions, he claimed uncertainty as to the age of his delinquent debts, lack of trust in his ex-wife to acknowledge his debts, and the absence of any 
deliberate intent to falsify his debt picture.  Applicant claimed to hold a security clearance for the better part of 25 years, during which time he has never had his 
judgment questioned.  Applicant requested retention of an interim clearance for 6 to 12 months pending further evaluation of his financial situation.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  
Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Between 1986 and 1995, Applicant and his spouse (W) incurred a number of debts together, which they could not repay and later defaulted on.  Comprising 
these debts are delinquent debts covered by creditor 1.a ($1,400.00), creditor 1.b ($1,2220.00), creditor 1.d ($2,189.00) and the retail accounts of creditor 1.f/g 
($4,699.00 and $5,806.00, respectively).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant and W sought credit counseling in 1995 in an effort to consolidate their debts and  entered into a debt management program with the intent of paying 
off these debts (<EM>see</EM> response; R.T., at 51-52).  By the program's terms, Applicant and W were precluded from assuming any more credit while in the program.  
For the time they stayed in the program, they complied with the terms of their consolidation agreement and incurred no additional credit debt.</P> 
 
<P>While in their debt management program, Applicant's car was severely damaged.  Since he and W only had one car between them, they faced a major 
challenge: Stay with their debt program  and do without an automobile or vacate the program, finance another vehicle and try to pay their debts on their own.  
After meeting with their debt program counselors, they elected to drop out of their debt program and resume full individual responsibility for their debts.</P> 
 
<P>Between 1995 and 2001, Applicant continued to rely on W to pay their debts and gave little thought to second guessing her assurances their bills were being 
paid.  Discussing the bills became such a sore subject with W that Applicant essentially gave up and deferred to her taking care of their finances.  For the 
duration of his marriage to W, Applicant never checked up to assure himself that  his joint debts were being discharged.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant and W separated in June 2001 and initiated divorce proceedings.  His divorce from W was finalized in September 2002 and is covered by a judgment 
of divorce and settlement.  Under the terms of their settlement agreement, Applicant is required to pay W $2,200.00 a month for the next three years, beginning 
in January 2003 (<EM>see</EM> ex. D).  The settlement agreement makes no provision for assigning any individual or joint responsibility for taking care of the couple's 
joint debts.  There is nothing in the settlement agreement to indicate how the couple's joint debts were to be paid.  At this time, the listed debts in the SOR were 
aged and had been written off as bad debts by the covered creditors.  And prior to issuance of the SOR, neither Applicant nor W made any demonstrable efforts 
to pay or enter into any form of repayment arrangements with any of these listed creditors.</P> 
 
<P>After issuance of the SOR, Applicant entered into a repayment agreement with a debt consolidation firm (ex. B).  His agreement covers his listed debts with 
creditors 1.a, 1.b, and1.d, but not the balance of the listed creditors in the SOR.  Beginning in March 2003, Applicant obligated himself to pay $170.00 a month 
(<EM>see</EM> ex. B).  His most recent payment (made in April 2003) was allocated between creditors 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.h, and another creditor not covered in the SOR.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's post-hearing submissions claimed payment of his 1.e and 1.h debts, but nothing on his remaining debts to creditors 1.c, 1.f/g and 1.i.  His latest 
efforts to contact creditors 1.c and 1.f/g were unsuccessful.  Each of these creditors informed Applicant they would look into Applicant's old debts  (<EM>see</EM> ex. E).  
Applicant is credited with paying off his listed debts covered in paragraphs 1.e and 1.h: a utility debt of $195.00 and an investment-related debt of $123.00, 
respectively (<EM>see</EM> exs. F and G; R.T., 40, 44)</P> 
 
<P>Asked to complete an SF-86 in September 2001, Applicant answered in the negative to questions 38 (debts over 180 days delinquent) and question 39 (debts 
over 90 days delinquent).  Applicant attributes his omissions of his delinquent debts to uncertainties over how long his debts were delinquent and whether they 
had been previously paid by W (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 68-69).  His explanations cannot be reconciled, though, with his 1995 consolidation attempts with many of these 
very same creditors or with his acknowledged awareness of the overdue status of at least some of the listed debts.  </P> 
 
<P>Having elected (jointly with W) to discontinue his debt consolidation efforts in 1995, Applicant made no identifiable follow-up attempt to address these debts 
until presented with an SOR.  He was clearly aware of his continuing legal responsibilities for these jointly created debts; even though he took no concerted 
action to address them before the issuance of the SOR.  Considering Applicant's disclaimers of any specific knowledge of the status of these debts when he 
completed his SF-86, his claims, juxtaposed against his past involvement with the debts, are too lacking in plausibility to gain acceptance.  On the basis of the 
evidence presented, Applicant's explanations are too inconsistent and unsubstantiated to avert drawn inferences his omissions of his listed debts were made 
knowingly and wilfully.</P> 
 
<P>When interviewed by a DSS agent in November 2001, Applicant did not acknowledge his delinquent debts when first queried about them by Agent A.  Only 
after Agent A showed him his current  credit report listing the debts did he admit the debts were his own (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3).  Applicant's acknowledgments under these 
circumstances cannot avert inferences of confrontation.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is highly regarded by his immediate supervisor who considers him both reliable and trustworthy.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) require that each decision  be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon 
consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2.  In making their decisions, judges 
must consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating 
Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to 
assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent 
considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in  reaching a 
fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
decision after appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's suitability for a security clearance depends, in 
large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a 
reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove by substantial evidence any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it 
must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing on the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of 
materiality, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or misused classified information 
before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of accessible risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently 
fail to safeguard classified information. </SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose 
of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant accrued considerable debt between 1986 and 1995, much of it credit card-related. He and his wife at the time endeavored to pay off these debts 
through a consolidation program arranged in 1995, but dropped out of the program when faced with the challenge of adhering to the program's no new 
conditions and replacing their damaged vehicle.  For the ensuing six years preceding their separation and finalized divorce in 2002, Applicant and W essentially 
ignored their accumulated debts and permitted them to be written off without any enforcement action taken.  Altogether, Applicant and his ex-spouse accrued 
over $15,000.00 in delinquent debt, which Applicant has not addressed until after issuance of the SOR.  On the strength of the evidence presented, Government 
may invoke two Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations: DC 1 (history of not meeting financial obligations) 
and DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>While Applicant's decision to vacate his debt consolidation program in 1995 is somewhat  understandable give his circumstances at the time with his vehicle, 
his avoidance of any repayment efforts or checks on his creditors to ascertain payment status in the intervening years preceding his divorce is not.  Once 
Applicant and W dropped out of their debt consolidation program they became responsible again for addressing their debts individually.  By all accounts, 
neither Applicant nor W made any efforts to repay these bills: They were content to rely on the lack of any enforcement action by any of their creditors to avert 
payment. </P> 
 
<P>An applicant's history of ignoring undisputed creditor obligations even when resources become available for repayment bears close resemblance to an 
applicant's being asked to  place his own private interests in subordination to the Government's security interests when the two intersect with one another.  
Over time, DOHA's Appeal Board has shown general consistency in disallowing applicant claims to mitigation based on charge-offs and limitation bars on 
debts previously unpaid due to cited extenuating circumstances, much less disregard of payment obligations.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 01-17474 (March 7, 2003); 
ISCR Case No. 01-13653 (March 7, 2003); ISCR Case No. 01-12147 (January 21, 2003).   Security clearance decisions are, of course, never an exact science, 
but rather involve predictive judgments about a person's security eligibility based on the person's past conduct and present circumstances.  <EM>See Department of 
Navy v. Egan, </EM>484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).   With little too little repayment history to support  his mitigation claims, he lacks the probative mitigation 
necessary to absolve him of the pressure and judgment risks associated with being in debt.</P> 
 
<P>Because  Applicant's repayment efforts are so recent and limited, it is too soon to credit him  with any of the mitigation benefits covered by MC 6  (initiated 
good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors) of the Adjudicative Guidelines.  More repayment seasoning is required before he may reasonably be credited with 
good-faith repayment efforts.</P> 
 
<P>To find insufficient mitigation of Applicant's accrued delinquent debts is not to minimize his personal accomplishments with his employer.  For these credits, 
Applicant merits acknowledgment and commendation.   Unfavorable conclusions warrant, accordingly, with respect to sub-paragraphs 1.a through1.d and 1.f, 
1.g, and 1.I through 1.k of the Adjudicative Guidelines governing financial considerations.  By contrast, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraphs 1.e and 1.h of the same Guideline.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Posing potential security concern as well are Applicant's omissions of his past due personal debts (exceeding 180 and 90 days, respectively) from his 
September 2001 SF-86.  Applicant's explanations of his laboring under uncertainties of the status of his listed debts cannot b reconciled with either his prior 
consolidation efforts or ensuing disregard of these debts.  Too implausible are his explanations, considering the multiple sources of information available to him 
about his debts, to enable Applicant to surmount the falsification implications of his omissions.  While it is true that developed falsification jurisprudence 
within DOHA's Appeal Board and the courts nationally have never been tied to reasonable man tenets, credibility assessments must still take account of  the 
surrounding circumstances when gauging motive and specific intent to falsify a document.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR OSD Case No. 01-06870 (September 13, 2002). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant fails to dispel doubts about his withholding known information about the status of most of his listed debts (even if certain ones he could not recall).  
His ensuing acknowledgment of his debts in his first scheduled DSS interview came only after he was shown a copy of his credit report, and, as such, cannot 
qualify as a prompt, good-faith correction of any deemed unreasonable omission of his debt delinquencies. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the strength of the evidence presented, Applicant may take no advantage of any of the available mitigating conditions for falsification under the 
personal conduct Guideline.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraph 2.a of Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative 
Guidelines of the Directive.</SPAN></P>
