<P>Applicant with a history of delinquent debts, some attributable to a period of unemployment by her husband, addressed only a few of her covered delinquent 
debts before receipt of the SOR, and still fails to provide a viable repayment plan, either individually or through a credit counseling service, that will enable her 
to discharge her old debts in an orderly way, and she fails to demonstrate emergent financial stability sufficient to absorb security risks associated with her 
pattern debt delinquencies.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On February 26, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</P> 
<P>Applicant responded to the SOR on March 23, 2002, and requested a hearing.  The case was  assigned to this Administrative Judge on April 26, 2002, and 
scheduled on April 29, 2002, for hearing.  A hearing was convened on May 29, 2002, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of six exhibits; Applicant 
relied on one witness (herself) and six exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on June 6, 2002.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Prior to the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the record with documentation of her payment of her VISA account.  There being no 
objection, and good cause showing, Applicant was afforded an additional seven (7) days to supplement the record with a documented collection notice from her 
covered  utility company and documented work out plan with a credit counseling service.  Government was afforded three (3) days to respond.  Within the time 
permitted Applicant provided documentary support of her satisfaction of her VISA debt.  Applicant's submission is accepted as Applicant's exhibit G.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 27-year old functional application analyst for a defense contractor (Company A) who seeks a security clearance at the level of secret.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is alleged to have incurred a number of consumer-related debts over a five-year period, which have become delinquent: eight in all totaling in excess 
of $12,000.00.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For her response to the SOR, Applicant to incurring the delinquent accounts listed in the SOR.  In explanation, she claims one of the debts has since been 
discharged (her $548.00 department store debt) and has made efforts to contact her remaining creditors to set up repayment arrangements.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Over a five-year period beginning in 1996, Applicant accumulated a number of consumer-related debts, a number of which became delinquent during a period 
of her husband's unemployment (<EM>see</EM> ex. 5).  She has earned an AA degree and is currently working on her bachelors degree; she has had to defer some of her 
education pursuits while she is expecting birth.  Applicant manages all of her family's finances and has made some efforts to contact her old creditors  to set up 
repayment arrangements.  She is able to document repayment of two of her smaller consumer accounts (<EM>i.e., </EM>her $482.00 VISA debt and her $548.00 department 
store debt) and has made several payments towards the discharging of her other two smaller debts: her listed $593.00 consumer debt and her $280.00 utility 
account (<EM>see</EM> exs. A, C and D; R.T., at 32, 36-37, 42, 49). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At one point (in April 2001), Applicant and her husband claimed a $2,501.00 net monthly remainder.  But since purchasing three vehicles (at a total monthly 
cost of $900.00), her monthly net remainder was reduced to around $1,400.00 a month (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 89), despite the raises she has received that have brought 
her current income to over $53,000.00 a year and the income contributions she receives from her husband (R.T., at 40).  This is still enough to address several 
of her remaining creditors with work out arrangements, but clearly not enough to repay all of them.  She has been unable to develop any kind of a debt 
consolidation arrangement with CCC to date for lack of sufficient income and reported unwillingness of any of her remaining creditors to accept anything but 
lump sum settlements (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 44).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Of Applicant's remaining four unresolved debts, two of them involve deficiencies from vehicle repossessions: one on a repossessed vehicle, in which the lender 
eventually obtained a deficiency judgment approximating $2,571.00, and the other on a repossessed vehicle that left a deficiency of  $4,564.00.  Instead of using 
some of her net monthly remainder that exceeded $2,500.00 in April 2001 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 5) to develop a viable consolidation plan with Credit Counseling Services 
(CCC), she  and her husband purchased additional replacement vehicles (in part made necessary by the maintenance problems they encountered with their other 
vehicles), which reduced their net monthly remainder to around $1,400.00 (<EM>see</EM> ex. F).   Her husband, in turn, didn't generate as much income from his work as 
he had expected, much of this due to the seasonal nature of his work (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 83-86).  So, the pool of assets they anticipated to have available to address 
their old debts did not materialize as they had expected when Applicant assured the interviewing DSS agent in April 2001she would begin addressing her old 
debts (<EM>see</EM> ex. 5).  With the added expense attributable to addressing her old debts and paying on the three vehicles she and her husband own and are obligated 
on (around $24,000.00 in aggregate car loans -<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 64-65, 87-88), she claims a current average net monthly remainder of no more than $700.00 (<EM>see</EM> 
R.T., at 91). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Still, Applicant and her husband continued to enjoy a net monthly remainder benefit even after they purchased their new vehicles, albeit, at a reduced amount.  
While it is understandable that Applicant has not heard back from her old creditors on her attempted repayment proposals, it remains less than clear how she 
could not develop a viable consolidation plan with CCC with the creditors she identified and her available remainder (<EM>viz.,</EM>either of the two  she alternatively 
claimed). With just four creditors left to work out repayment with, reason and common sense suggest that at least some of these creditors would be open to 
working with Applicant on any repayment plan developed jointly with CCC.  Applicant's explanation for being rejected by CCC for lack of any net available 
income is inconsistent with the net-remainder summaries she reported in April 2001, and at the hearing, and cannot be reconciled with any of the documented 
exhibits.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Besides her brief consideration of CCC as a means for addressing her old debts, Applicant  and her husband explored the bankruptcy option.  She talked with an 
attorney in October 2000 about petitioning for bankruptcy, but changed her mind after her husband did not get his expected bonus.  With the bonus, they 
intended to retain the attorney to complete the necessary petition and other court requirements necessary to obtain a bankruptcy discharge.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Determined to address their remaining four debt delinquencies individually, Applicant and her husband have had little success working out individual 
repayment plans.  Two of her major debts  (<EM>i.e., </EM>her $1,418.00 credit card debt and the $4,564.00 deficiency left after the lender's repossession of her husband's 
truck) are covered by the same collection agency, who offered to take a lump sum $2,500.00  lump sum payment in settlement of the two debts (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 33-34).  To date, Applicant has been unable to enlist any kind of a monthly payment plan from this collection agency.  Just as she continues to make efforts to 
develop viable repayment plans with her remaining creditors, she is unable to provide any predictable estimates of when she can resolve these remaining debts 
(<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 78-82).  How much success she achieves in these repayment efforts is very difficult to assess with the available data she has provided. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided no character references, and little is known about her work habits and trustworthiness at work.  To her credit she has received salary 
increases with her current employer, a generally reliable indicator of how well she has executed her assigned duties and met her employer's expectations. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list "binding" policy considerations to be made by Judges in the decision making process covering 
DOHA cases. The term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the Judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security 
clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the Judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In 
addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 
E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense 
decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often linked to 
proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (<EM>e.g., </EM>loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 6.  The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical 
basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a nexus to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of nexus, however, does not require the 
Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant 
for the purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant comes to these proceedings with a history of security-significant delinquent debts  that trace, in part, to her husband's unemployment for a period and 
their later unfulfilled expectations of generating additional income to fund the repayment of their debts.       </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Over a six-year period spanning 1996 and 2002, Applicant became delinquent in a number of consumer-related debts she and her husband incurred.   Except for 
four of the smaller debts which she has since paid or is paying on, she has been unable to address these remaining debts (all of which have gone to collection 
status).  One of her debt delinquencies was ultimately reduced to a deficiency  judgment, following a vehicle repossession and proper crediting of the bid 
proceeds.  While Applicant has sought out credit counseling, she has so far failed to follow through any CCC-sponsored debt consolidation, either due to her 
own financial limitations or reluctance of the creditors to work out monthly repayment plans with she and  her husband. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At issue in this proceeding is not only Applicant's reliability and trustworthiness in light of her accumulation of delinquent debts and one outstanding judgment, 
which currently stand in excess of $11,000.00, after credit for the debts she has resolved, but also her unwillingness to seriously address them (either 
individually or through some form of debt consolidation program, or even bankruptcy), before initiation of her security application and issuance of an SOR.  
Security concerns are not abated by her apparent inability to fashion any realistic means to discharge her old debts.  Security determinations have never 
confined risk considerations to the elimination of debts that result from collection action, write offs and judgments, but rather they  have looked to the 
applicant's overall financial history to shed light on her most recent conduct as an indicator of repeat potential.  This the Government has done in underscoring 
Applicant's still ongoing financial difficulties associated with her continuing repayment responsibilities.  In other words, judgment/trust concerns are implied 
from past financial problems when considering the security significance of delinquent debts. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, some judgment lapses must be imputed to Applicant for taking on new car purchases and diverting remainder income away from a potential repayment 
pool attributable to Applicant's  accumulations of surpluses linked to her salary increases (based on her DSS assurances in April 2001).  Security concerns 
justifiably attach to Applicant's failure to make more earnest efforts to repay her old creditors, either through individual repayment efforts, debt consolidation, 
or even bankruptcy.  Appraising the security significance of Applicant's financial deficiencies, several Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines (for financial) apply: DC 1 (history of not meeting financial obligations) and DC 3  (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While most of Applicant's consumer-related debt assigned for collection, or taken to judgment,  might be extenuated by exigent circumstances (<EM>viz., </EM>the 
unemployment periods of her husband), none warrant total extenuation and mitigation, given Applicant's emergent repayment capabilities and reluctance to 
take more aggressive measures with resolving her debts back in 2001 and the time since.  Without a viable plan to resolve her delinquent debts and/or 
deficiency judgment without considerable increase in her income,  she leaves too much to chance and risk.  At this time her efforts leave simply too much to 
speculation: much of her debt repayment prospects remain untested and uncertain.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is to be encouraged in her ongoing efforts to better herself through advanced education and promotional opportunities, contemporaneous with 
achieving financial stability.  Nothing in the record indicates any work-related trust problems associated with Applicant, and with her awarded salary increases, 
she would appear to have a promising career with her current employer.  It is still too soon, however, to make safe predictions about how she will discharge her 
old debts and mitigate her still unresolved financial problems.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant, accordingly, with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.b,1.c, 1.e and 1.g. of Guideline F.  Only sub-paragraphs 1.a, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.h, which cover debts already shown to have been discharged, are 
resolved favorable to Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors set forth in the Procedures section (paragraph 6) 
of the Directive, as well as E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the same Directive.</SPAN></P>
