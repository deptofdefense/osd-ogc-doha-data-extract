</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant's history of harassment complaints leading to company warnings and suspensions and ensuing misuse of his position as a levee district commissioner 
to organize group that he promised his best efforts as a commissioner to steer business their way reflects not only pattern violations of accepted rules of 
behavior in the workplace, but also violations of his fiducial duties as a commissioner of a public commission.  His exhibited pattern of determined harassment 
and abuse of his fiducial position as a commissioner reflect adversely on his judgment and reliability. On the record presented, he fails to mitigate the 
Government's security concerns under Guideline E of the Adjudicative Guidelines.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 6, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on May 19, 2004 and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on November 9, 2004, and was scheduled for hearing 
on December 7, 2004.  A hearing was convened on December 7, 2004, for the purpose of considering whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of 12 exhibits; Applicant relied on three 
witnesses (including himself) and one exhibit.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on December 15, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to (a) have received multiple notices from his employer of sexual harassment between September 2000 and November 
2001, based on harassment complaints filed against him, (b) have been the subject of an Inspector General's recommendation for appropriate action after he 
concluded Applicant misused his authority as a Commissioner of a local levee district and (c) have been replaced as a commissioner of his levee district by the 
Governor of his State in September 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">            For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations.  He denied two of the allegations: his termination in February 2001 for 
allegations of sexual harassment and his termination in March 200 for allegations of sexual harassment of a minor female worker.  But he denied the remaining 
allegations without explanation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 45-year-old analyst for a defense contractor who seeks to retain his security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by 
Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An employee of his current defense contractor since 1993, and currently a project foreman, Applicant is college educated (with a masters degree in engineering 
technology) and married with two grown children (ages 30 and 23).  He is familiar with the female employee who filed harassment complaints against him with 
his employer in September 2000, October 2000, and January 2001.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had befriended the complainant (a new employee with the company) and oft-took her to sporting events and exchanged visits to each others' homes 
(R.T., at 39-40).  As Applicant describes the complainant, she had become frustrated about finding a better job.  Applicant, in turn, volunteered to help her and 
followed up with a potential job lead with a DoD military group.  Once he told her of the potential job opportunity, she reacted negatively, and their collegial 
relationship deteriorated (R.T., at 41-43).  In questioning her as to why she did not follow up with the employment contact, he used an expletive word to address 
her and sent a vulgar e-mail to her, reportedly in response to a joke she made to him earlier, according to the employee's complaint summary of her first 
reported harassment complaint in September 2000 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant acknowledges receiving official warning notices (albeit too illegible to discern) from his employer in September 2000, October 2000 and January 
2001 as the result of a single harassment complaint filed against him by A (R.T., at 45-49). However, he insists (a) the first two warning notices involved the 
one September incident, and no more (<EM>see</EM> exs. 2 and 3; R.T., at 49-50) and (b) the third warning (ex. 4) involved a claim from the same complainant in January 
2001 that Applicant said something to her one evening while passing by her desk that couldn't be substantiated (R.T., at 49-51).  Each of the incidents 
complained of, however, is documented by warning notices to Applicant (albeit not very legibly), which Applicant is unable to credibly refute with 
documentation of his own.  The complainant, though, did play some contributory role in the covered incidents, for which she also received warning notices 
concerning her part in the incidents (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2; R.T., at 52-53).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following his first two warning notices, Applicant  was issued work suspensions: a five-day working suspension and a final warning following the September 
complaint and a three-day suspension following the October complaint.  While he disagreed with the harassment accounts of the complainant in each of the 
reported incidents, he never visibly challenged the suspensions and completed them.  He appears to have avoided any further complaints from the complaining 
employee (who he claims also received company warnings resulting from Applicant's exchanges with her) or any other employee at his work place.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to his employment duties with his defense contractor during the 2000 to 2002 time frame, Applicant served as an appointed commissioner for a local 
levee district empowered by the State (<EM>see</EM> exs. 1 and 8 through 12; R.T., at 74-76).  He received his appointment from his State's governor in 1992 on the 
recommendation of one of the state's legislators and twice had been reappointed by a different governor (R.T., at 81-82).  By its charter no individual 
commissioner of the levee board can commit the board to any contracts.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Nonetheless, Applicant (in September 2000) solicited engineers from his company to attend a meeting designed to interest them in creating a company that 
would seek public contracts from the levee district he served on.  In his e-mails to the solicited engineers, Applicant promised to use his influence as a levee 
district commissioner to steer business to their newly created business (<EM>see</EM> exs. 1 and 10).  Many of the solicited engineers responded favorably to Applicant's 
request and voluntarily attended the first organizational meeting arranged by Applicant in September 2000.  At the convened meeting, all of the six in 
attendance agreed to reconvene in October to select a new name to call the organization and brief each other on their findings (<EM>see </EM>ex. 1; R.T., at 59-61).  In a 
follow-up September 2000 e-mail Applicant sent to the participants of the meeting, he confirmed their agreement  to reunite in early October to adopt a name 
for their newly proposed organization and brief each other on how to incorporate (<EM>see</EM> ex. 1).  In the same e-mail Applicant confirmed his efforts to try and use 
his position with the levee board to steer some work to their organization, only to see his efforts blow apart at the previous night's levee board meeting (ex. 1). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant insists "he was blowing smoke" (a hoax), since he had no power as a commissioner of the levee district to individually approve any work for the 
organization and was working with the organizing group only in an advisory role (R.T., at 30-31, 60-74).  That he had no actual power to approve outside work 
as an individual commissioner is supported by the current commission president of the levee district (R.T., at 85-86). In his testimony, the commission 
president (who was present during the Inspector General's investigation of Applicant) opined that he thought Applicant was trying to do something (<EM>viz., 
</EM>committing the levee board to contracts) he had no power to do as an individual member (R.T., at 86).  When pressed, though, the commission president 
acknowledged Applicant's encouraging others on several occasions to form companies as a means of generating levee board business for minority contractors.  
He considered Applicant's actions on their face to reflect  poor judgment but not illegal or unethical behavior, absent any actual individual power to commit the 
board to contracts.  Because the commission president  has  never personally discussed the e-mails with Applicant, any personal impressions of Applicant's 
reasons for writing the e-mails are wholly speculative and entitled to very little weight (R.T., at 93-94, 100-02). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">What Applicant can't corroborate with his evidence are his claims he had no intention of persuading his fellow organization attendees he would use his 
influence as a levee district commissioner to try and steer business to their newly proposed organization.  His advisory acknowledgments to the persons 
attending his 2000 meetings are detailed in his signed, sworn DSS statement of January 2003, and his ensuing e-mails show no indicia of insincerity or joking 
around (<EM>see</EM> ex. 12).  He does not appear to have been successful either in persuading his own company that his solicitation efforts amounted to a joke.  Based 
on its internal review of Applicant's e-mails and employee interviews, Applicant's employer (in November 2001) found he misused his company computer in 
using it to solicit co-workers to participate in a private business and issued him a warning notice (<EM>see</EM> ex. 7).  His employer later filed adverse information 
reports on Applicant: first in May 2002 (<EM>see </EM>ex. 10), noting Applicant's solicitation of company engineers to work for a private company being created by 
Applicant, and later in September 2002 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 11), calling attention to an newspaper article stating Applicant had been fired from a levee district position by 
the State's Governor. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For this misuse of his computer, Applicant acknowledges his mistake in using company equipment for this private purpose (R.T., at 59).  But he continues to 
characterize his termination as politically motivated, based on his association with the legislator who sponsored his appointment, and who Applicant believed 
was out of favor with the current governor who replaced him on the levee district.  Politics may have played some role in Applicant's dismissal from the levee 
district.  But without more proof of a causal connection between the State Governor's actions and the Inspector General's findings regarding Applicant's 
organizing activities, political considerations cannot be used to neutralize or diminish the weight and effect of the Inspector General's findings on the State 
Governor's decision to replace Applicant on the levee district.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">According to the State Inspector General's April 2002 report, the levee district in which Applicant served on as a commissioner is responsible for drainage, 
flood control and water resources development in the river section of Applicant's parish, in addition to its responsibilities for constructing and maintaining 
levees and drainage systems within its district.  In exercising its responsibilities, the levee district (according to the Inspector General) may buy, sell, or 
exchange property, enter into contracts and perform any acts necessary to carry out its assigned duties.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As a part of its April 2002 findings, the State's Inspector General found that Applicant did attempt to persuade co-workers to form an engineering company and 
advise them by e-mail he would use his position on the levee board to obtain work for the group.  In an e-mail cited by the Inspector General in its report, 
Applicant e-mailed his organizational group in October 2001, informing the group that he "had worked out a deal with the levee district for me to select the 
company to do the construction management for our 100 million dollar flood protection project . . ." (<EM>see </EM>exs. 6 and 9).  But in fact, no deals were made by the 
levee board with Applicant that allowed him to select contractors for levee district work.  Although, the Inspector General's report does acknowledge 
Applicant's questioning the levee board's engineering firm about its use of contractors (<EM>see</EM> ex. 9).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The State's Inspector General concluded in its April 2002 report that Applicant misused his authority as a member of the levee board when he told them in the 
process of trying to organize a group of co-workers to pursue a business venture with him that he could use his official power as a levee district member to steer 
business to them (ex. 9).  The Inspector General also concluded that Applicant's unsolicited role in trying to persuade his co-workers to join in this venture, 
when considered in light of all of the circumstances present, created the appearance he had some type of personal interest in the venture (<EM>see </EM>ex. 9)<EM>.  </EM>That 
Applicant might have been exaggerating his powers,  when he suggested he could use the power of his office to refer business to them, or that the State's 
Inspector General's findings and conclusions may have been politically motivated, is not visibly apparent to either the group participants or the drafters of the 
Inspector General's report.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Acting on the recommendations of the Inspector General in its April 2002 report, the State's Governor (from a different political party than the ones that 
appointed Applicant to his levee district position) replaced Applicant on the State's levee board (<EM>see</EM> ex. 11, referencing a local newspaper's coverage of 
Applicant's reported firing in ex. A),   citing his misuse of his position to steer contracts to the firm he was trying to create.  Although it is possible that the 
Governor replaced Applicant on the levee board to spite his mentor (a local elected official who had sued the governor), it is far more likely the Governor fired 
Applicant over the findings and conclusions reached in the Inspector General's report (<EM>compare </EM>exs. 9 and 10 with exs. 12 and A).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant continues to claim he made no attempt to misuse his levee board position to try and obtain business for his organization but was only "blowing 
smoke."  He could persuade neither the investigating State Inspector General nor his own company of his hoax claims, however, and provides too little 
corroborative support for such claims in his evidentiary submissions (limited to the impressions of the current levee district president and a member of the 
organizing group who later dropped out) to warrant acceptance.  In the adverse information report filed by his employer in May 2002 shortly after being notified 
of the Inspector General's report through a company "hot line," his company facility clearance security officer reported that Applicant had in fact solicited 
engineers from a company work site to work for a private company he said he was creating, and that he would use his influence as a local levee district 
commissioner to steer levee district contracts to the proposed firm (<EM>see</EM> ex. 10). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although neither the Inspector General's report nor his company's adverse information report attempt to determine whether in fact Applicant had tried to elicit 
levee board contract approvals for his new firm, each report emphasized Applicant's overt attempts to use his levee district  relationship to organize his new 
firm with promises of exerting influence.  Without more probative proof his efforts represented no more than blowing smoke, he can not avert inferences he 
enlisted the support of others associated with his employer to organize a new firm that would be the recipient of steered business from Applicant's levee district 
as the result of his personal influence as a levee district commissioner.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate 
that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under  the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> 
<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in 
the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that 
evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  
Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the SOR and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have 
a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require 
the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant comes to these proceedings with a history of warning notices and work suspensions from his employer over a three-month period in 2000-2001 (three 
in all) resulting from sexual harassment complaints from a female subordinate of his in his work location.  These actions raise security concerns about 
Applicant's judgment, reliability and judgment that are compounded by the termination actions taken against him by the Governor of his State following the 
receipt of an Inspector General's report concluding he misused his authority as a commissioner of a local levee district by trying to organize and steer levee 
district business to his organized group.   Applicant's actions and continuing reluctance to acknowledge and account for his judgment lapses raise security 
concerns about his judgment and reliability under the guidelines covered by  Guideline E (personal conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's actions are covered by the personal conduct Guidelines: E2A5.1.2.1 (<EM>Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, 
coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances</EM>) and E2A5.1.2.5 (<EM>A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with.  Applicant's actions reflect a pattern of proven mistakes of judgment, which he continues to dispute and avoid 
accountability for. His repeated approaching of the complainant, even after he had received a suspension as the result of her initial sexual harassment complaint, 
reflects poor choices on Applicant's part.  These poor choices reflect adversely on his judgement and reliability.  Were the acts complained of by his 
subordinate  his only judgment lapses they might be mitigated by both time and overall favorable professional behavior on and off the job.  However, the 
harassment complaints lodged against him do not represent Applicant's only judgement mistakes.  Of considerable security concern as well is his misuse of his 
position as a commissioner of a local levee district in organizing a group of associates to receive business steered to the group (once organized under 
Applicant's direction).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's claims he considered his actions a hoax and of no tangible consequence are not reflected in either the findings and conclusions of the State's 
Inspector General or in the warning notices and adverse information reports issued by his company.  The collective effect of Applicant's cited harassment of a 
subordinate of his and misuse of his position as a commissioner of a local levee district is to create adverse impressions about his overall judgment, reliability 
and judgment, which are not mitigated by any of Applicant's firm disclaimers of any wrongdoing.  Based on the record presented, Applicant may not take 
advantage of any mitigating conditions under Guideline E.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant's recurrent sexual harassment conduct and misuse of his official position as a levee district 
commissioner, Applicant fails to mitigate security concerns relative to his judgment lapses associated with his actions. Unfavorable conclusions warrant with 
respect to the underlying conduct covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f of Guideline E.</SPAN></P>
