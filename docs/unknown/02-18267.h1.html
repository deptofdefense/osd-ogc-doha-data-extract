</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant pleaded guilty in 2001 to aggravated child abuse by aggravated battery (a felony) and associated misdemeanor fire arms offenses.  The court imposed 
ten years probation on him, which remains in affect. While the incident is an isolated one it a serious one that continues to draw upon the supervising court's 
probation authority.  Despite demonstrated rehabilitative progress, it is still too soon to make the necessary safe predictive judgments about the absence of any 
recurrence risks.  Applicant is credited with successfully refuting allegations he falsified his security clearance application (SF-86).   Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">          On July 18, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance, and recommended referral 
to an administrative judge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on August 5, 2003, and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant was furnished the File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) on January 2, 2004, and received it on February 10, 2004.  Applicant  responded to the FORM within the 30 days provided him with 
supplemental documentation.   The case was assigned to me April 14, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested in State A in November 2000 and charged with aggravated assault (felony), aggravated child 
abuse by aggravated battery (felony), improper exhibition of a dangerous weapon and discharging a firearm in public (misdemeanors), to which he pled guilty 
in May 2001 to aggravated child abuse charge (a felony), improper exhibition of a dangerous weapon and discharging a firearm in public (both misdemeanors) 
and was awarded withholding of sentencing on the felony charge and placed on 10 years probation to be served concurrently with the probation sentence for the 
misdemeanor charges.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his SF-86 of November 2000 by omitting his November 2000 arrest when answering questions 21, 22, 
23 and 24.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted his November 2000 arrest and disposition but denied any intent to falsify his 2000 SF-86.  Applicant to have 
complied with his probation terms,  reconciled with his son, received company awards for his excellent performance and expressed remorse for his actions.  He 
denied falsifying his November 2000 SF-86, which he signed while stilling receiving the effects of the incident.  He claimed to have notified his company 
security of the incident on his work day back to work in November 2000, and to have informed his DSS interviewer voluntarily of the aggravated assault 
incident on his first day back from work.  And he claimed rehabilitation through the positive steps he has since taken to eliminate future such incidents. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 51-year-old analyst who seeks a security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by 
reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Through his marriage to his wife, Applicant raised and supported a stepdaughter from his wife's former marriage and a son born to them.  After a period of 
marital problems, Applicant and his wife divorced in 1993.  Following the divorce, Applicant's son continued to live with him.  The son would visit his mother 
on a weekly basis, or when he wanted to.  To address his advancing inflammatory arthritis, Applicant was prescribed pain pills (estimated to be sometime in 
1997).  Eventually, he became addicted to mood altering pain medications, to include Lorcet, oxycontin and morphine (<EM>see</EM> ex. 10).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the evening of November 22, 2000, Applicant was at home alone and sedated with prescription pain killers and alcohol when his son arrived home to share 
television time with Applicant.  After a verbal exchange over the television, an angry exchange ensued between Applicant and his son (17 at the time).  Soon 
thereafter a physical exchange erupted between them.  When Applicant arose from a dazed and state he grabbed his shotgun, moved outside the home and fired 
off several rounds in the direction of his son's truck.  One of the rounds ricocheted off the truck and  struck the son in the leg.  Applicant waited for the police 
to arrive and was arrested without incident. Applicant's son went on to the hospital for a check up and was released the same night. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following his arrest in the evening of November 22, 2000, Applicant was jailed pending further investigation of the incident. He spent three days in jail before 
being released.  When he appeared in court on May 18, 2001, Applicant pled guilty to aggravated child abuse by aggravated battery (felony), improper 
exhibition of a dangerous weapon, and discharging a firearm in public (both misdemeanors).  After withholding sentencing on the felony charge, the court 
placed Applicant on 10 years probation to be served concurrently with the one year probation sentence for the misdemeanor charges.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's supervised probation conditions comprised drug and alcohol screening, random urinalyses, completion of an anger management course, no non-consented contact with his son, counseling and educational programs as established by his probation counselor, and abstention from alcohol and controlled 
substances and paraphernalia.   Applicant's probation conditions included provision for early termination of probation after five years, if, he committed no 
violations and complied with all of the probation conditions, subject to continued drug treatment (<EM>see</EM> ex. 8).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on his demonstrated compliance with all of his probation conditions, Applicant has been permitted to travel out of the state to perform his work 
assignments, subject to his payment to the State of a $50.00 processing fee.  The state's attorney has reportedly recommended Applicant's probation time be 
reduced from 10 to five years.  It is not documented, however, as to whether the court has approved a probation reduction.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Asked by his facility security officer (FSO) to update his SF-86 in November 2000, Applicant did so.  The SF-86 that is referenced in the exhibit file (ex. 4) is 
electronically generated and contains no Applicant signature.  Applicant assures he provided the requested information prior to his November 22, 2000 offense 
and, accordingly, could not have omitted his November 22, 2000 arrest/charge.  While his claims cannot be documented, he is of record in reporting the 
incident to his FSO on November 27, 2000, shortly after his release from jail (<EM>see </EM>ex. 7).  Such a prompt report is consistent with mind-set intent on disclosing 
the adverse information to the proper authorities and serves to reinforce Applicant's assurances that he did not falsify his SF-86.  Based on,  his assurances, his 
prompt report of the incident to his FSO, and his credited voluntary disclosure of the offense to the DSS agent who interviewed him in July 2001, Applicant's 
assurances are fully accepted.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has since reconciled with his son and no longer relies on prescription pain killers to control the pain from arthritis.  He is once again highly regarded 
by his supervisor and coworkers.  He has received excellent performance evaluations, that his supervisor assures are comparable to his pre-addiction levels.  
Applicant appears to have regained the trust and confidence of his supervisor and coworkers.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list guidelines to be considered  by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
Judges must consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the 
"Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the 
judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the 
pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are 
intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1  Allegations or admission of criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 2  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG> None</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack fo candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG> None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions: </STRONG>None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires administrative judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may draw</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual inferences that are 
grounded on speculation or conjecture</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of a material bearing, 
however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can 
deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of accessible risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to 
safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose 
of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant comes to these proceedings with no criminal history before the incident with his son in November 2000 that resulted in his pleading guilty to 
aggravated child abuse by aggravated battery (a felony) and associated misdemeanors involving his use of a firearm.  Applicant's guilty plea and ensuing 
deferred sentencing and accompanying ten year probation (not due to expire until 2001) unless reduced by court approval raise security concerns about his 
judgment and reliability under Guideline J (criminal conduct).  Besides his criminal history, a security issue is raised about his omission of his 2000 
arrest/charge from his SF-86, which Applicant successfully refutes.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's aggravated assault offense involving his son, although isolated as he claims, is a serious one and warrants the application of two of the disqualifying 
conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for criminal conduct: DC 1 (allegations or admission of criminal conduct) and DC 2 ( a single serious or 
multiple lesser offenses).  Government must be able to repose a high degree of trust in those it bestows access to classified information.  <EM> Snepp v. United 
States, </EM>444 U.S. 507, 511n.6 (1980).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because Applicant's 2000 assault incident was the first such incident involving a physical assault of his son or family member, it is as he claims: isolated and 
the result of an exchange between Applicant and his son that was totally atypical for them.  Addressing the incident head on, Applicant accepted the State's 
probation conditions and has maintained compliance with  all of the conditions required of him.  He may, accordingly, apply pertinent  mitigating conditions 
(MC) covered by the Adjudicative Guidelines for criminal conduct: MC 1 (behavior not recent) and MC 2 (isolated incident)serious positive steps taken to 
significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress).   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Still, Applicant remains subject to the probation conditions set by the court on what must be regarded as a serious felony and related misdemeanor offenses.  
Even with low-risk re-offense assessments from Applicant's probation counselors and Applicant's own assurances, it is difficult to credit Applicant with</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
successful</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> mitigation efforts in the face of his pending probationary status, his still unfinished treatment, and the considerable  supervised probation he still 
faces.   While there is certainly nothing in the Directive that makes current probationary status a <EM>per se </EM>bar to a favorable security decision, it cannot be 
discounted either.  Our Appeal Board has observed that continued probationary status is a consideration that significantly undercuts an applicant's claim of 
successful reform and rehabilitation.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 96-0710 (June 20, 1997); DISCR Case No. 90-1115 (October 6, 1992).  Because he is still on 
probation, he may not at this time invoke MC 6 (clear evidence of rehabilitation) of the Guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant's 2000 offense, the isolated nature of the incident, Applicant's still unfinished probation 
status, and the steps Applicant has taken to date to restore and rehabilitate the damaged trust he has created with his son (aided by the support he has continued 
to receive from his supervisor and work colleagues), it is still too soon to make safe predictive judgments about Applicant's being able to stay clear of addictive 
pain killers and the psychological affects they produce.  Given his probation status at the present, it is too early to conclude he has mitigated security risks 
associated with his admitted offense.  This is not to diminish the positive impressions he has gathered from his supervisor and colleagues at work who continue 
to support him.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">But in the face of his still relatively recent offense, for which he remains under the court's probationary supervision,  his favorable character 
evidence alone is not enough to mitigate security concerns extant with the Government over his past conduct.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to 
the allegations covered by Guidelines J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By successfully refuting allegations he deliberately falsified his SF-86, Applicant surmounts Government concerns over the omission of his November 2000 
SF-86 that was electronically generated without his signature or demonstrated approval of the completed questions after the November 2000 incident.  
Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative 
Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
