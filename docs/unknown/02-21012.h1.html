<P>On July 2, 1984, Applicant entered a plea of nolo contendere to the offense of Manslaughter by Operation of an Automobile While Intoxicated or Deprived of 
Full Possession of Normal Faculties.  He was sentenced to be imprisoned for a term of four years followed by a period of three years on probation.  Because of 
the statutory disqualification imposed by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, he is unable to mitigate the security concern his criminal conduct has created.  Clearance is denied.  I 
do not recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On April 30, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-21012.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline J for criminal conduct based upon Applicant's 1984 manslaughter conviction.  The SOR also alleges that 
10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 disqualifies Applicant from having a security clearance granted or renewed. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a sworn answer to the SOR on July 22, 2003, and requested a hearing.  Applicant admitted that he was convicted of vehicular 
manslaughter on July 2, 1984 and sentenced to four years in prison and three years probation, but denied that his conviction created doubt about his judgment, 
reliability or trustworthiness.  He also acknowledged that his criminal conviction prohibited renewal of his security clearance because of the applicability of 10 
U.S.C. &sect; 986 to his case.  He requested that his case be referred to the Secretary of Defense for consideration of a waiver.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">This case was assigned to me on September 24, 2003.  A notice of hearing was issued on October 3, 2003, scheduling the hearing for October 14, 2003.<A HREF="02-21012.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled.  The government submitted seven documentary exhibits at the hearing that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-7 
and admitted into the record without an objection.  The Applicant testified at the hearing and submitted ten documentary exhibits that were marked as 
Applicant's Exhibits A-J and admitted into the record without an objection.  The transcript was received on October 23, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's partial admission to the sole allegation in the SOR is incorporated herein.  In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
character reference letters, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 66-years-old, has never been married, and he has no children.  He quit high school before graduation and worked as a runner on Wall Street in New 
York City until he joined the United States Navy in August 1954, one month after his seventeenth birthday.  He served on active duty in the Navy until May 
1958, attaining the rank of Seaman, paygrade E-3, and was then transferred to the inactive reserve.  He received an Honorable Discharge in 1962.  He was 
awarded a Good Conduct Medal and European Occupation Ribbon.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Following his release from active duty, Applicant was employed on the docks in New York City until he joined the Military Sea Lift Command in 1962.  He 
served with the Military Sea Lift Command until he was fired in 1984 as a result of his criminal conviction.  After being released from prison he started a small 
business and worked at that until he was hired as a merchant mariner in 1988 or 1989.  He has continued to work as a merchant mariner since that time, and is 
presently serving aboard ships as a Chief Mate.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant received a suspended sentence in 1951, when he was approximately 14-years-old, for grand larceny car.  He was taken to a summary court-martial 
while on active duty with the Navy for the offense of Unauthorized Absence and fined $25.00.  He was convicted on July 2, 1984 of the offense of 
anslaughter by Operation of an Automobile While Intoxicated or Deprived of Full Possession of Normal Faculties.  He was sentenced to be imprisoned for a 
term of four years followed by a period of three years on probation.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's manslaughter conviction resulted from his driving an automobile after he had taken Tylenol with codeine and then consumed alcohol for 
approximately three to four hours on October 28, 1983.  The Tylenol had been administered by medical personnel to alleviate pain he was experiencing from a 
work-related injury to a finger.  Applicant does not recall the incident, but police reports disclose he struck a parked automobile that was then forced into two 
pedestrians, killing one and injuring the other.  He entered a plea of nolo contendere to the offense on July 2, 1984 and received the above sentence.                 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant participated in alcoholics anonymous (AA) meetings and obtained a general equivalency diploma (GED) while serving his penitentiary sentence.  He 
also assisted other inmates in learning to read and by writing letters for them.  The record does not disclose how much time Applicant actually served in the 
penitentiary, however, he was discharged from probation on December 18, 1986.  He was issued a certificate of restoration of civil rights by the office of 
executive clemency of the state in which he was convicted on August 6, 1987.  Applicant has not been convicted of any offenses since his release from the 
penitentiary, to include minor traffic offenses.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has not consumed any alcohol beverages since he was arrested for the manslaughter offense.  He no longer attends AA meetings, but does keep in 
contact with friends whom he met through AA.  He has earned a reputation among his friends, co-workers, supervisors, and others for being loyal, trustworthy, 
dependable, competent, and dedicated to our country.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has possessed a security clearance for much of the time since he first joined the Navy in 1954.  There have never been any complaints made or 
investigations conducted of any alleged breeches of security or mishandling of classified information on his part.  No action has ever been taken to revoke or 
downgrade a clearance held by Applicant because of security concerns, prior to the action herein involved.  Applicant has on many occasions worked on ships 
that were engaged in highly classified activities on behalf of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance.  Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.  Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline J, 
pertaining to criminal conduct, with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-21012.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-21012.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="02-21012.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="02-21012.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-21012.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-21012.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-21012.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-21012.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="02-21012.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="02-21012.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness.  Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation's secrets.  A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case against Applicant under Guideline J.  The evidence establishes that he did commit the offense of Manslaughter by 
Operation of an Automobile While Intoxicated or Deprived of Full Possession of Normal Faculties on October 28, 1983.  He was sentenced on July 2, 1984 to 
be imprisoned for a term of four years followed by a period of three years on probation.  While the record does not disclose how much time he served in the 
penitentiary, it is clear that he was actually imprisoned for some period of time.    Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser 
offenses</EM>; and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year 
</EM>apply in this case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In addition to the 1984 manslaughter conviction, Applicant had a juvenile adjudication when he was 14-years-old, and he committed a minor military offense 
approximately fifty years ago.  He has otherwise lived an exemplary and  law-abiding life.  He has committed no offenses since being released from the 
penitentiary more than fifteen years ago, and has not consumed alcohol since that incident.  The character letters and record of training he submitted attest to his 
competency as a merchant mariner, excellent reputation, and personal trustworthiness.  I find that Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>: The criminal behavior was 
not recent</EM>; MC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The crime was an isolated incident</EM>; MC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not 
likely to recur</EM> and MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation </EM> apply in this case.  However, because of the statutory disqualification imposed by 
10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, Applicant is unable to mitigate his criminal conduct.  Guideline J is decided against Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  Security clearance decisions are not intended to adjudge guilt or to impose 
further punishment for past transgressions.  Rather, the objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person' 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their 
acts and omissions, including all criminal conduct, whether or not otherwise mitigated.  I have given full consideration to the nature and seriousness of the 
offense committed by Applicant, as well as the character references, training record, and personal testimony he provided.   I do not recommend further 
consideration of this case for a waiver of the disqualification mandated by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. </SPAN></P>
