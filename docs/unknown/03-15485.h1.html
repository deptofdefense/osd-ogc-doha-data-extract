<P>Born in Israel, Applicant, exercised dual citizenship when he possessed and used a foreign passport after obtaining U.S. citizenship in 1988.  When he 
surrendered his foreign passport as required and renounced his Israeli citizenship, he mitigated security concerns. He has had a security clearance since 1987

family ties with dual citizenship, no one in his family has ties to a foreign government nor seem vulnerable to pressure.  Applicant established that if he were 
ever approached by anyone seeking classified  information, he would report such a contact or threat to a responsible security official.  Applicant has mitigated 
the security concerns under Guidelines C and  B. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On November 18, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise 
security concerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference)and Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  The SOR<A HREF="03-15485.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> informed Applicant that DOHA adjudicators could 
not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant's security clearance.  Applicant requested 
an extension to respond which was granted until January 23, 3004.  On January 19, 2004, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. </P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to me on April 26, 2004.  On April 27, 2004, Applicant advised Department Counsel that he would be available for a hearing on May 27, 
2004.  Subsequently on May 5, 2004, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing and set this case to be heard on May 27, 2004 in a city near where Applicant lives and 
works. At the hearing the government presented three exhibits (Exhibits1-3) which were admitted into evidence without objection.  As Applicant did not object, 
I also granted Department Counsel's request that I take administrative notice of the information contained in Exhibits I-V. (TR 16-19)  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant presented two exhibits (Exhibits A and B), which were admitted without objection.  Applicant also testified in his own behalf.  Department Counsel 
did not object to my leaving the record open until June 10, 2004, so that Applicant could submit additional evidence.  Department Counsel was granted until 
June 15, 2004, to review the evidence and provide his comments.  (TR 12-13)  However, additional time was requested and granted.  Applicant submitted his 
additional evidence on June 2, 2004 (Exhibit C) and on June 18, 2004 (Exhibit D);  Department Counsel had no objection to the admission into evidence of 
these exhibits.  Exhibits C &amp; D were admitted into evidence; and the record closed on June 19, 2004.  DOHA received the transcript (TR) on June 7, 2004.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, age 52, was hired at his corporation (Corporation #1) in State #1 in 1985 and has worked there until the present.  He was granted a Secret security 
clearance in September 1987.  He was promoted several times and now serves in a senior position.  He completed a Security Clearance Application in 
November 1999. Applicant has a B.S.E.E. degree in June 1978 from a university in State #1 and an MBA from a university in State #1 which was granted in 
June 1982.  (Exhibits 1, 2; TR 13-14, 25-26; 30, 40-41)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline C - Foreign Preference</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, a citizen of the Israel by his birth there in 1952, first came to the U.S. as a student in June 1976.  After he graduated in June 1978 he worked for El-Al Israeli airlines as a security guard.  After he got the proper U.S. visa he got a job with Corporation #2 in his field in 1978.  He joined Corporation #1 initially 
in June 1981 and worked there until June 1983 when he returned to Israel to work for Corporation #3 until 1985 when he was recruited by Corporation #1 to 
return to the U.S.  Applicant and his family made a conscious decision in 1985 to live in the U.S.  He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 
December 1986 and obtained a U.S. passport in January 1987; he renewed his U.S. passport in 1997.  (Answer; Exhibits 1, 2, 3; TR 13-14, 25-26; 30-31, 42-45)   </P> 
 
<P>Applicant fully disclosed his dual citizenship in his initial Defense Security Service (DSS) interview in February 1987 and again in February 2001.  He also 
disclosed his past military service in the Israeli Air Force from 1972-1976.  In 2001 he stated he had no further reserve military obligation<A HREF="03-15485.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> to the Israeli Air 
Force.  While initially he stated he would bear arms for the U.S. against any country except Israel and in the "unlikely event" of a US/Israeli confrontation he 
would take no measure to harm the U.S. and would remain neutral, he later revised his views.  In January 2004 he declared that in the unlikely event of a war 
between Israel and the U.S. he would support the US and if required he would bear arms against any country, including Israel.  He maintains no contact with 
members of any foreign government.  He unequivocally stated he would report any attempts to attain classified information to the proper U.S. law enforcement 
authorities.  He has no benefits from the State of Israel and has never voted in Israel since he has been a U.S. citizen.  (Answer; Exhibits 1, 2,  3; TR 38-39, 41)  
All of his property and bank accounts are in the U.S. (Answer; TR 14)  He has no business relationships with any companies in Israel.  (TR 43)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Applicant maintained his Israeli citizenship since he believed initially that once born in Israel he was always a citizen.  Because of his birth in Israel he was 
required to possess an Israel passport to enter or leave the country.  (Answer; Exhibits 1, 2; TR 44)  He only used his Israeli passport for travel to Israel; 
otherwise he used his U.S. passport.  (TR 28)  He believed that both the U.S. and Israel allowed citizens to hold dual citizenship, but stated in January 2004 that 
should "new regulations be put into effect," he would follow them and give up his Israel citizenship.  He had an Israel passport that was to expire in July 2006; 
he renewed his Israeli passport after becoming a U.S. citizen as required by Israel law and used his Israeli passport to enter and exit Israel.  (Answer) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">While Applicant received a copy of the DoD policy statement on the need to surrender his foreign passport (the "Money Memorandum"<A HREF="03-15485.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>) with his Statement 
of Reasons in November 2003,  he did not understand the correct procedures to surrender his Israeli passport until May 2004 when he spoke with Department 
Counsel in preparation for the hearing.  Once he understood the requirement, he declared he would surrender his Israeli passport and renounce his Israeli 
citizenship to maintain his security clearance: he took initial steps in May 2004 and surrendered his Israeli passport in June 2004.  Applicant requested the 
Consulate General of Israel cancel his Israeli passport in June 2004.  He initiated the steps to renounce his Israeli citizenship.  The consul provided a letter 
apprising that Applicant is in the process of renouncing his Israeli citizenship.  (TR 15, 27-30; 47-48; Exhibits C, D)</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Applicant married his wife in Israel in September 1978.  She is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Israel.  They have two children who also are dual citizens of the 
U.S. and Israel: one was born in the U.S. in 1980 and the second was born in Israel in 1984; he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1991.  As long as his son 
lives in the U.S. and does not remain in Israel for more than three months per year, he will not have to serve in the Israeli armed forces.  (Exhibits 1, 2; TR 13; 
26, 36-37, 45-46)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Applicant has traveled to Israel about once a year to visit his family and contacts his mother, brother and sister about twice a month by telephone.  His mother 
previously worked as a secretary in a medical center; she now is 78 years old and not currently employed.  His sister is 38 and is employed as a teacher; her 
husband is self-employed.  His brother is 49 and is self-employed.  They are citizens of and residents of Israel with no ties to the government.  To the best of 
Applicant's knowledge none of his family members are associates or agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force him to chose between loyalty to them and the US.  (Answer; Exhibits 1, 2; TR 14, 27; 31-38)  Applicant provides no financial support to his family 
in Israel. (TR 41)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Applicant has maintained his Secret Clearance granted in 1987 for 17 years; and he has never violated or jeopardize any of the guidelines with respect to 
classified material.  He could not perform his work without access to classified information.  (Answer; TR 14, 27)</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted 
facts alleged in the SOR.  If the government meets its burden it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the 
Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no 
one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a 
fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant 
possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with 
the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG>Guideline C (Foreign Preference)</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The Government raised a security concern over any of Appellant's acts which indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States as he may be 
prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. The Government established its case that Applicant 
exercised his Israeli citizenship and continued to possess his foreign passport after he became a naturalized U.S. citizen as he used his Israeli passport 
exclusively for travel to Israel. Under DC 1 and DC 2 this disqualifying conduct  indicated a preference for his status as an Israeli citizen over his status as an 
U.S citizen.  The possession of a foreign passport could allow Applicant to travel without accountability and outside the ambit of U.S. immigration controls 
which raises concerns when someone has access to U.S. classified information.  Further, the Government established through the documents they submitted for 
administrative notice (ON I-V) that even governments that are allies of the U.S. may not have identical interests on vital matters.  Balanced against security 
concerns over Applicant's previous disqualifying conduct is the fact that many of the indicators of possible foreign preference (e.g., his foreign military service) 
occurred before he obtained United States citizenship in 1987.  Thus, MC 2 applies to his previous foreign military service.  While he at once point expressed 
reservation about his willingess to bear arms for the U.S. against Israel, he has reconsidered that earlier position and reversed it in a manner that I found 
credible.  With respect to his dual citizenship, Applicant had a security clearance that he held without incident for 13 years before the  Money memorandum 
was issued in August 16, 2000. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> Applicant was notified of the policy with the issuance of his SOR in November 2003.  Initially, he was unsure how to proceed to comply with these security 
requirements. Once Applicant understood the U.S. security concerns over his retaining his foreign citizenship, he expressed his willingness to surrender his 
passport and began the steps to renounce his Israeli citizenship;  in June 2004 he returned his foreign passport to the issuing authority to cancel it.  Thus, MC 4 
applies because he took required steps to renounce his foreign citizenship.  Having turned in his foreign  passport to be cancelled complies with the steps 
required by the Money memorandum of August 16, 2000.  While Applicant's surrender of his passport is not alone dispositive of  whether he Guideline C 
should be mitigated, his actions lend credence to his position that he does not prefer interests of another country over those of the U.S.  Additionally,  I conclude 
that there is little, if any, probability Applicant will someday reacquire his Israeli passport and use it instead of his U.S. passport. He has demonstrated  a strong  
preference for the U.S. over any other foreign nation by giving up his Israeli citizenship even though he has an elderly mother who remains in Israel.   Applicant 
has lived and worked in this country continuously since 1985 and has had a U.S. security clearance since 1987.  All of his financial assets and his immediate 
family are in the U.S.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Adding to the significance of his own mitigating acts is the high praise for Applicant from two highly placed officials at his corporation who recommend his 
security clearance be maintained and not revoked because of the excellence of his character and his performance.  For example, one vice-president at 
Corporation #1 recommended that Applicant's security clearance be granted as he has not observed any conduct or heard Applicant make any statements that 
would cause him to question Applicant's allegiance to the U.S. or to prefer another government over that of the U.S. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Having weighed the record evidence as a whole under the other factors outlined in Directive, I conclude Applicant's conduct was not undertaken in such a way 
as to establish his preference for a foreign country over the U.S.  I conclude Guideline C for Applicant.  Thus, favorable findings are warranted with respect to 
subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.h. of the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG>Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that 
could result in the compromise of classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The government has established that Applicant's mother, brother and sister are immediate family 
members who are citizens of a foreign country and reside in a foreign country. As it is within the realm of possibility that the Israeli government might coerce 
these family members to leverage Applicant's access to classified information to its benefit, Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> applies.  The government urges that 
Applicant is at risk of compromising classified information because the presence of family members in Israel may be used to coerce Applicant into acting 
contrary to U.S. national interests even though Israel has been a long-term ally of the U.S. with substantial annual direct aid.  The government also raises 
concerns over Applicant's  wife and children who are dual citizens, even though they reside in the U.S., could present similar risks.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">On the other hand  no evidence suggests that Applicant's wife and his children who are residents of the U.S. and a dual citizen of the U.S. and Israel are in a 
position to be exploited by a foreign power.  In addition, there is no evidence that Applicant's mother, brother and sister who are residents of and citizens of 
Israel are agents of the Israeli government and could be pressured by them or be exploited by this foreign power.  Applicant's mother is elderly and retired from 
a non-governmental position; she is not dependent on Applicant for her support.  While he has concerns for her, he demonstrated he made the security interests 
of the U.S. a higher priority when he took steps to renounce his passport and cancel his passport as discussed above.  Similarly, neither his sister nor his brother 
work for the government.  While there is no denying the fact of their family ties, their relationship is not such that it might be leveraged by a foreign entity as 
contemplated by Guideline B.  Nor is there any substantial likelihood that they would exercise foreign influence over Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Therefore, I conclude Applicant is not vulnerable to duress merely because of these family ties as he has a long history of responsible conduct having had a 
security clearance since 1987.  It is improbable that any of his family members would create a situation that could result in the compromise of classified 
information, as  Applicant has had ties to the U.S. over a long period of time.  Thus, any risk of foreign duress or influence on Applicant and/or his immediate 
family would appear to be slight and clearly manageable.  Applicant persuasively declared that if he were ever approached by anyone seeking information on 
his classified work, he would report such a contact or threat to a responsible  security official.  Company officials attest to his long history of responsible 
conduct in his long tenure with the company.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I conclude these ties are not of such a nature as to create any tangible risks 
of undue pressure, so do not invoke foreign influence concerns. In light of the available information regarding Applicant's and his wife's foreign family ties and 
their relationship,  Mitigating Condition (MC) MC 1 and MC 3 apply. On balance, I resolve Guideline B for Applicant.  Thus, favorable findings are warranted

to cases involving an applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport.  The Guideline specifically provides that "possession and/or use of a foreign passport" may be a 
disqualifying condition.  It contains no mitigating factor related to the applicant's personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign 
country.  The only applicable mitigation factor addresses the official approval of the United States Government for the possession or use. ****  Therefore, consistent 
application of the guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from 
the appropriate agency of the United State Government."</SPAN></P>
