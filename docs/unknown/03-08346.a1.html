<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On March 26, 2004, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 21, 2005, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Leroy F. Foreman 
denied Applicant's request for a security clearance. Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
<P>Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge erred by failing to apply Guideline E Mitigating Condition 2 (MC2)<A HREF="03-08346.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>; 
whether the Administrative Judge failed to consider properly the passage of time; whether the Administrative Judge failed to give adequate weight to 
Applicant's previous maintenance of a security clearance; whether the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Applicant lacked candor is sustainable.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Administrative Judge found:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Applicant served in the Marines from 1967 to 1971, at which point he joined the U.S. Army Reserve and subsequently served there ever since.  Applicant is 
now an E-7.  Applicant started a career as a corrections officer.  In 1982, he was dismissed from a job as a county correctional officer for: fraternizing with an 
inmate, using the public address system to intimidate an inmate, illegally depositing funds in an inmate canteen fund and attempting to conceal the deposit by 
altering records.  Applicant denied the allegations.  Applicant originally offered a story regarding an anonymous visitor's contribution to the fund.  However, in 
his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, Applicant admitted making the contribution out of compassion for an old friend.  He denied altering the records.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In 1986, Applicant began work as a state correction officer.  In 1990, he received two letters of counseling, one for bumping an inmate and one for a breach of 
security.  (Letters of counseling were not regarded as disciplinary actions, rather they were considered training tools).  In 1991, he was suspended for seven days 
for sleeping on duty.  Applicant denied  the charge in his answer to the SOR, but admitted it at the hearing.  The supervisor who reported Applicant at the time 
now supports his application for a security clearance.  In 1992, Applicant was suspended for three days for harsh treatment of an inmate.  In 1993, he received a 
letter of counseling for unnecessary physical contact with an inmate.  In 1994, Applicant was suspended for one day for sexual harassment.  Ultimately, an 
Administrative Law Judge found Applicant had committed breach of the peace rather than sexual harassment.   Applicant was reprimanded in 1994 for using 
unnecessary force against an inmate and failing to report the incident.  In 1996, Applicant was again reprimanded for use of unnecessary force against an 
inmate.  In 1999, Applicant was reprimanded for using profanity or racial epithets, although an Administrative Judge later found him not guilty in that instance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was promoted in April 2000.  In September 2000, Applicant disciplined an inmate and then signed his supervisor's name to the notice of inmate 
violation without notifying the supervisor.  Applicant's explanation for the event is inconsistent with the evidence.  In October 2000, Applicant was demoted 
back to the grade he had held prior to April 2000.  Applicant retired in May 2002 and received a citation for his high integrity and ability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant's history was covered under Guideline E, Disqualifying Conditions 1<A HREF="03-08346.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN>, 4<A HREF="03-08346.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN>, and 5.<A HREF="03-08346.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN>  The Judge also 
considered Applicant's lack of candor and failure to take responsibility for his conduct on the issues of rehabilitation and likelihood of recurrence (the Judge 
explicitly noted that it is improper to base an adverse decision on uncharged conduct but proper to consider it for matters such as rehabilitation and likelihood of 
future rule violations).  On the other hand, the Judge applied Guideline E, Mitigating Condition 5<A HREF="03-08346.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and discussed various elements related to the whole person 
concept.<A HREF="03-08346.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">By its plain language Guideline E, Mitigating Condition 2<A HREF="03-08346.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> does not apply to the issues in Applicant's case.  Applicant's other challenges to the Administrative 
Judge's decision are unpersuasive.  The Judge's analysis follows reasonably from his unchallenged findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Accordingly, Applicant has not met his burden of establishing error. </SPAN></P>
