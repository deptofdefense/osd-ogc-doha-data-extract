  A security clearance that was ended or terminated approximately 7 years ago does not warrant reciprocity under Section 2-203 of the NISPOM.  Section 2-203 of the NISPOM does not preclude a federal department or agency from conducting periodic reinvestigation of persons holding a security  clearance, or periodically reevaluating whether a person should continue to retain a security clearance that was previously granted.  Applicant failed to  demonstrate the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that neither Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions 1 and 3 were applicable to Applicant's family  ties with immediate family members in Iran.  Given the record evidence in this case, the Judge erred by not explaining why he decided to not apply Foreign  Influence Mitigating Condition 4, but that error was harmless in light of the Judge's other sustainable findings and conclusions under Guideline B.  Applicant  did not rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Terry L. Elling, Esq.</SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated March 11, 2004, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline C 
(Foreign Preference).  Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated November 8, 2004.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge's conclusions with respect to Guideline B (Foreign Influence) violated 
Section 2-203 of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual ("NISPOM"); (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred in finding that none of 
the mitigating conditions under Guideline B applied; and (3) whether the Administrative Judge erred in failing to properly apply the "whole person" concept.  
For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's conclusions with respect to Guideline B (Foreign Influence) violated Section 2-203 of the National Industrial Security 
Program Operating Manual ("NISPOM")</SPAN>.  On appeal, Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge ruled against him on the basis of information relating to 
foreign influence that was available to the Government in the course of prior security clearance adjudications that were determined in his favor.  He further 
argues that no new significant derogatory information has been developed since those prior adjudications.  Applicant contends that the Administrative Judge 
erred by not making a favorable security clearance decision in this case based on application of Section 2-203 of the National Industrial Security Program 
Operating Manual (NISPOM),<A HREF="03-04172.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> which reads: "<STRONG>Reciprocity</STRONG>.  Federal agencies that grant security clearances (TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL, Q or 
L) to their employees or their contractor employees are responsible for determining whether such employees have been previously cleared or investigated by the 
Federal Government.  Any previously granted PCL<A HREF="03-04172.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> that is based upon a current investigation of a scope that meets or exceeds that necessary for the clearance 
required, shall provide the basis for issuance of a new clearance without further investigation or adjudication unless significant derogatory information that was 
not previously adjudicated becomes known to the granting agency."  Department Counsel contends that Section 2-203 of the NISPOM is not applicable in this 
case.</P> 
<P>Under Section 2-203, reciprocity is predicated on: (a) a person having an existing security clearance, (b) based on a current investigation, (c) of a scope that 
meets or exceeds that necessary for the security clearance at issue, and (d) the absence of significant derogatory information that was not previously adjudicated.  
If any of the elements is missing, then Section 2-203 does not apply.</P> 
<P>Applicant's reliance on his Q clearance, issued by the Department of Energy, is misplaced.  Applicant testified that his Q clearance was issued in 1992 and 
ended in 1997 or 1998 (Hearing Transcript at p. 80).  A security clearance that was ended or terminated approximately 7 years ago does not constitute an 
existing security clearance "that is based upon a <EM>current</EM> investigation."<A HREF="03-04172.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant's reliance on the issuance of a DoD security clearance to him in 1990 also is misplaced.  Nothing in Section 2-203 indicates or suggests that it bars 
any federal department or agency from conducting periodic reinvestigation of persons holding a security clearance.  Furthermore, nothing in the language of 
Section 2-203 or the concept of reciprocity,<A HREF="03-04172.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> indicates or suggests that a federal department or agency is precluded from periodically reevaluating whether a  
person should continue to retain a security clearance that was previously granted by that federal department or agency.  Section 2-203 does not transform a 
favorable security clearance decision into a vested right or entitlement to a security clearance in perpetuity.  Finally, the 1990 decision to grant Applicant a DoD 
security clearance was based on an investigation that is not "current" under NISPOM Section 2-201.<A HREF="03-04172.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in finding that none of the mitigating conditions under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) applied</SPAN>.  The Administrative 
Judge concluded that the strengths of Applicant's ties to his sister and brother who are citizens and residents of Iran were such that security concerns exist under 
Guideline B.  The Judge also concluded that the fact of Applicant's travel to Iran in 1998 and 2001 on an Iranian passport that identified him as a U.S. resident, 
nature of the Iranian regime and his sister's employment with an oil company that is part of the Iranian Ministry of Petroleum created potential risks that 
precluded mitigation of the security concerns.  The Judge did not apply any of the Guideline B Mitigating Factors and he specifically declined to apply 
Guideline B Mitigating Condition 1.<A HREF="03-04172.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  On appeal, Applicant argues: (a) the evidence establishes that his contacts and correspondence with his siblings are 
casual and infrequent, thus establishing a basis for the application of Guideline B Mitigating Condition 3<A HREF="03-04172.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>; (b) regarding Guideline B Mitigating Condition 4,<A HREF="03-04172.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> 
Applicant complied with the requirements to report his trips to Iran to the appropriate authorities, and there is every indication that he would report any requests 
or threats to disclose classified information; and (c) the Judge erroneously discounted Guideline B Mitigating Condition 1.  For the reasons that follow, the 
Board concludes Applicant's arguments lack merit, with one exception that demonstrates harmless error.</P> 
<P>Regarding the fact that the Administrative Judge did not apply Guideline B Mitigating Condition 3 in Applicant's favor, the Board concludes that the record 
evidence was not such that the Judge was required, as a matter of law, to apply the mitigating condition.  There is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with 
immediate family members are not casual.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0484 (February 1, 2002) at p. 5.  The evidence cited by Applicant -- that he extends no 
financial support to his siblings, has no financial ties to Iran, and has seen his sister only four times in twenty-five years and has not spoken with her in the last 
year -- is relevant evidence, but it did not compel the Judge to conclude that Guideline B Mitigating Condition 3 should be applied.  As Department Counsel 
notes, there is other relevant record evidence that shows Applicant's ties with his immediate family members in Iran -- when viewed in their entirety -- are 
more than merely "casual and infrequent."  Applicant has failed to establish error on the part of the Judge.</P> 
<P>Regarding the applicability of Guideline B Mitigating Condition 4, the fact that Applicant dutifully reported his trips to Iran to the proper authorities is 
favorable evidence that the Administrative Judge was bound to consider.  A Judge must apply pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines.  <EM>See</EM> 
Directive, Section 6.3 and Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.25.  Given the record evidence presented by Applicant regarding his reporting his trips to 
Iran, the Judge should have explained why he decided application of Guideline B Mitigating Condition 4 was not warranted.  The Judge's failure to give such 
an explanation was error.  However, the error is harmless in light of the Judge's other sustainable findings and conclusions under Guideline B.</P> 
<P>Applicant begins his argument regarding the application of Guideline B Mitigating Condition 1 by stating that the presence of Applicant's siblings in Iran is an 
issue that is precluded from the Administrative Judge's consideration by the operation of Section 2-203 of the NISPOM.  For the reasons stated earlier in this 
decision, this is not a tenable argument.  Applicant goes on to argue that the Judge's conclusion that his sister's presence in Iran as an employee of an oil 
company that is part of the Iranian Ministry of Petroleum constitutes a potential risk was an unsupported assertion.  Applicant also argues that the evidence of 
his long-term financial and personal ties to the U.S. and his proven record of handling classified information for 14 years without any security violations  is 
overwhelming and negates any arguable tie to his sister and brother that could prompt him to compromise classified information to Iran.  Applicant has failed to 
demonstrate that the Judge erred by not applying Guideline B Mitigating Condition 1.</P> 
<P>Under the Directive, once it has been demonstrated that Applicant has immediate family members in a foreign country, the burden shifts to Applicant to show 
the government's concerns about Applicant's overseas family are mitigated.<A HREF="03-04172.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  An applicant with immediate family members living in a country hostile to the 
United States has a heavy burden to show that those family ties do not pose a security risk.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (October 16, 2002) at p. 10.  In this 
case, there is no dispute that Applicant's brother and sister live in Iran, a country with a history of hostility toward the United States since 1979.  Record 
evidence introduced by Department Counsel in this case indicates that the Iranian government is involved in international terrorism, supports violent opposition 
to the Middle East peace process, and has a dismal human rights record.  The hostility of the Iranian government to the United States goes beyond mere 
diplomatic disagreement and gives rise to significant security concerns.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-04786 (June 27, 2003) at pp. 4-5.  Accordingly, Applicant 
bears a heavy burden of showing that the presence of his siblings in Iran does not pose a security risk.  Moreover, when determining the applicability of 
Guideline B Mitigating Condition 1, the key issue is not what choice Applicant would likely make when confronted by a foreign government in search of 
classified information.  The determination to be made under Mitigating Condition 1 is whether or not the presence of Applicant's relatives in Iran creates the 
risk that Applicant will be placed in a position where he has to make the choice between his affections and/or obligations to his family in Iran and the United 
States.   Finally, Applicant's sister works for an oil company that is part of the Iranian Ministry of Petroleum and, as such, is an agent of a foreign government 
within the meaning of Guideline B Mitigating Condition 1.  The Board concludes that the record in this case is sufficient to support the Judge's conclusion that 
the security concerns raised by the presence of Applicant's immediate family in Iran have not been mitigated.  Applicant has not demonstrated on appeal that 
the Judge should have applied Guideline B Mitigating Condition 1 to his brother and sister in Iran.</P> 
<P>3.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in failing to properly apply the "whole person" concept</SPAN>.  Applicant also contends the Administrative Judge's 
decision contains no consideration of the whole person concept.  Applicant cites favorable record evidence and argues that the only conclusion supported by the 
evidence is that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to renew his security clearance.</P> 
<P>To the extent Applicant's argument asserts the Judge ignored evidence favorable to Applicant, it runs afoul of the rebuttable presumption that a Judge considers 
all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise. <EM> See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at p. 2.  That presumption is not rebutted 
or overcome merely because Applicant is able to point to favorable evidence that he claims the Judge should have given more weight to.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case 
No. 02-15935 (October 15, 2003) at p. 6.  Moreover, Applicant's ability to proffer an alternate interpretation of the record evidence is not sufficient to 
demonstrate the Judge's decision fails to reflect a common sense determination that applies the whole person concept.  A reading of the decision below 
persuades the Board that the Judge reached reasonable conclusions that take into account the record evidence as a whole -- including the favorable evidence 
presented by Applicant.  Given the record evidence in this case, the Judge's analysis of Applicant's security eligibility is consistent with the whole person 
analysis required by the Directive.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0628 (February 24, 2003) at pp. 5-6 (discussing application of the whole person concept).</P>
