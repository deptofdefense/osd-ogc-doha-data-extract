<P>Applicant's excessive child support indebtedness and omissions on his security clearance application regarding the debt have not been mitigated by sufficient 
evidence of reform and rehabilitation.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On September 28, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 17, 2001, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was transferred 
to the undersigned on January 30, 2002.  A notice of hearing was issued on February 11, 2002.  The hearing was held on March 5, 2002, at which the 
Government presented four exhibits.  The Applicant presented ten exhibits.  The Applicant called four witnesses and testified on his own behalf.  The official 
transcript (Tr.) was received on April 25, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 53 years old, married, and he has a bachelors degree in Electronics.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Laboratory Manager, and is 
seeking to obtain or retain a security clearance in connection with his employment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</SPAN>  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially 
overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is indebted to the Department of Child Support Services in the amount of $52,555.00 for delinquent child support payments since 1992.  As of 
February 2000, the debt had not been satisfied.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant explained that in 1977, at the time of his divorce, the court ordered that he pay his child support in the amount of $400.00 a month.  During the 
years to follow, the Applicant was laid off on a number of occasions, sometimes for as long as six months.  During those periods, he was unable to make the 
child support payments.  He gradually began to fall farther and farther behind, as the amount he owed continued to accumulate.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since 1986, the Applicant's wages have been garnished by three of his previous four employers to pay his child support obligation.  The Applicant contends 
that although he has not always been able to afford to pay the child support, he has sent money to his ex-spouse and children when he had some to send.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1990, the Applicant's high school children, who had always resided with his ex-spouse, came to live with the Applicant.  After a year, the Applicant's son 
returned to live with his mother, but his daughter continued to live with the Applicant until she went to college.  Since then, the Applicant has continued to 
provide all of her financial support.  During this period, he was also paying his child support obligation, without any modification to the initial agreement.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since September 2001, the Applicant's wages have been garnished in the amount of $500.00 a month.  (Tr. p. 78).  The Applicant has recently hired an attorney 
who is demanding an accounting to determine the exact amount of child support still owed by the Applicant.  The Applicant contends that the exact amount he 
owes is unclear, given the fact that each year his income tax refunds are withheld for payment, and that no adjustment has been made for the years his daughter 
was living with him.  Whatever the amount determined to be owed, the Applicant intends to continue to pay the debt, until it is completely paid off. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">      </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has also hired a Consumer Credit Counseling Service to consolidate his other bills to be better able to manage his debt.  (Tr. p. 50).  The 
Applicant indicates that the payment schedule he follows enables him to stay current on all of his other financial obligations.  The Applicant also indicates that 
he is up for a promotion that will include about a $10,000.00 raise per annum.         </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material 
aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (Standard Form 86) dated August 23, 1999.  In response to question 28 which asked, 
"In the last seven years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debts? " the Applicant answered "NO."  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 1,Question 28).  
This was a false answer.  The Applicant stated that when he answered the question, he did not consider the child support to be a debt, like a car payment or a 
mortgage or credit cards.   He simply mis-characterized the child support debt.  He had no intention of concealing the information, as he in fact revealed it in 
response to another question on the application.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 1, Question 27(b).)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same application asked, "Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts?"   The Applicant answered "NO".  (<EM>See,</EM> Government Exhibit 1, 
Question 28(b).) This was a false answer.  Again, the Applicant did not consider his child support to be a regular bill.  Since he was current on all of his other 
monthly financial obligations he answered "NO."  He made a mistake.  Again, he had no intention to conceal the information concerning his child support 
delinquency, as he in fact revealed it in response to another question on the application.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 1, Question 27(b).)   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's past and current supervisors, and a company security manager, each testified that the Applicant is extremely reliable and  trustworthy, and 
essentially nothing short of exemplary on the job.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's daughter testified that she has lived with her father from the age of fourteen until she went to college in 1994.             </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">             3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or statute, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility and dishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has excessive child support indebtedness (Guideline F); and that this 
information was not revealed in response to two questions on his security clearance application (Guideline E).  Because of the scope and nature of the 
Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence shows that over the past twenty-five years, since his divorce in 1977, the Applicant has experienced periods of unemployment and under 
employment that has contributed to his current excessive child support arrearage.  However, there were other occasions where he was gainfully employed and 
his child support obligation was not paid until a garnishment action was implemented.  Three out of his past four employers have had to garnish his wages to 
pay his child support arrearage.  Unfortunately, however, this indebtedness has grown over time to become so excessive that it now poses a significant security 
risk.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is now gainfully employed and is paying his child support obligation through a garnishment in the amount of approximately $500.00 a month.  
Hopefully, he will continue to pay this debt until it is paid off, which will take a significant amount of time.  At the present time, he has not demonstrated that 
he is trustworthy and meets the eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, Guideline F (Financial Considerations) is found 
against the Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered the Applicant's excuses for failing to list his child support as a debt on his security clearance application of August 23, 1999, in response to 
questions 28 and 28(b).  The Applicant clearly admitted the child support indebtedness in response to another question on the application, specifically question 
27(b), which explains that he had no intent to conceal the information.  I find his explanation credible and believable.  Consequently, the evidence proves that 
the Applicant has not been dishonest with the Government regarding his financial history.  I find that the Applicant did not deliberately conceal information 
from the Government.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of 
Reasons.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>

he is up for a promotion that will include about a $10,000.00 raise per annum.         </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material 
aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (Standard Form 86) dated August 23, 1999.  In response to question 28 which asked, 
"In the last seven years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debts? " the Applicant answered "NO."  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 1,Question 28).  
This was a false answer.  The Applicant stated that when he answered the question, he did not consider the child support to be a debt, like a car payment or a 
mortgage or credit cards.   He simply mis-characterized the child support debt.  He had no intention of concealing the information, as he in fact revealed it in 
response to another question on the application.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 1, Question 27(b).)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same application asked, "Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts?"   The Applicant answered "NO".  (<EM>See,</EM> Government Exhibit 1, 
Question 28(b).) This was a false answer.  Again, the Applicant did not consider his child support to be a regular bill.  Since he was current on all of his other 
monthly financial obligations he answered "NO."  He made a mistake.  Again, he had no intention to conceal the information concerning his child support 
delinquency, as he in fact revealed it in response to another question on the application.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 1, Question 27(b).)   </SPAN></P>

essentially nothing short of exemplary on the job.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">             3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or statute, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility and dishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has excessive child support indebtedness (Guideline F); and that this 
information was not revealed in response to two questions on his security clearance application (Guideline E).  Because of the scope and nature of the 
Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence shows that over the past twenty-five years, since his divorce in 1977, the Applicant has experienced periods of unemployment and under 
employment that has contributed to his current excessive child support arrearage.  However, there were other occasions where he was gainfully employed and 
his child support obligation was not paid until a garnishment action was implemented.  Three out of his past four employers have had to garnish his wages to 
pay his child support arrearage.  Unfortunately, however, this indebtedness has grown over time to become so excessive that it now poses a significant security 
risk.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is now gainfully employed and is paying his child support obligation through a garnishment in the amount of approximately $500.00 a month.  
Hopefully, he will continue to pay this debt until it is paid off, which will take a significant amount of time.  At the present time, he has not demonstrated that 
he is trustworthy and meets the eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, Guideline F (Financial Considerations) is found 
against the Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered the Applicant's excuses for failing to list his child support as a debt on his security clearance application of August 23, 1999, in response to 
questions 28 and 28(b).  The Applicant clearly admitted the child support indebtedness in response to another question on the application, specifically question 
27(b), which explains that he had no intent to conceal the information.  I find his explanation credible and believable.  Consequently, the evidence proves that 
the Applicant has not been dishonest with the Government regarding his financial history.  I find that the Applicant did not deliberately conceal information 
from the Government.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of 
Reasons.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
