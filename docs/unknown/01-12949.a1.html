  Because there is no presumption of error below, the Board need not review an Administrative Judge's findings of fact that have not been challenged on appeal.  The Judge's findings about Applicant's history of episodic alcohol abuse, numerous traffic violations, and criminal conduct provide a rational basis  for the Judge's adverse conclusions about Applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness under Guidelines E, G, and J.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny issued a decision, dated December 6, 2002, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.</P> 
 
<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the 
reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated March 15, 2002.  The SOR was based on Guideline G 
(Alcohol Consumption), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).</P> 
 
<P>A hearing was held on August 28, 2002.  The Administrative Judge issued a written decision, dated December 6, 2002, in which he concluded it is not clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 
2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 
87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge made findings of fact about Applicant's history of alcohol abuse, numerous citations for traffic violations, and criminal conduct in 
1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000.   On appeal, Applicant does not challenge the Judge's findings of fact.  Rather, Applicant asserts that he has completed required 
probation, and that he has not been in trouble since then except for a speeding ticket for which he was required to perform community service.  The Board 
construes Applicant's appeal statements as raising the issue of whether the Judge's adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to 
law.</P> 
 
<P>As noted earlier in this decision, there is no presumption of error.  Because Applicant does not challenge any of the Administrative Judge's findings of fact, the 
Board need not review those findings in order to decide this appeal.</P> 
 
<P>The federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to classified information.  Given the 
Administrative Judge's findings of fact about Applicant's history of episodic alcohol abuse, numerous traffic violations, and criminal conduct, the Judge had a 
rational basis for his adverse conclusions about Applicant's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness under Guidelines E, G, and J.</P> 
 
<P>To the extent that Applicant's appeal statements can be construed as making a claim that he has demonstrated reform and rehabilitation, the Board concludes 
Applicant has failed to demonstrate the Judge erred.  The Judge had to consider the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, and decide 
whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  The Judge considered the facts and circumstances of Applicant's alcohol 
abuse, traffic violations, and criminal conduct and weighed them against the evidence that Applicant presented to support his claim that he had reformed and 
rehabilitated himself.  The Judge concluded that the favorable evidence Applicant presented was not enough to demonstrate reform, rehabilitation, or changed 
circumstances sufficient to warrant a favorable security clearance decision.  Considering the record as a whole, the Board concludes the Judge's weighing of the 
record evidence was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating error below.  Accordingly, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance 
decision.</P>
