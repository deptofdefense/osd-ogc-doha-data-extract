<P>This 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor has a 26 year history of alcohol abuse, a 24-year history of arrests, falsified an answer on his security 
clearance application, and lied to an agent of the Defense Security Service. No mitigation has been established.  Clearance is denied.    </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On January 31, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons</P> 
<P>why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it</P> 
<P>is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative 
Judge to conduct proceedings and</P> 
<P>determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</P> 
<P>On March 25, 2005, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a 
hearing. The matter was assigned to me on June 13, 2005. A Notice of Hearing was issued on June 22, 2005. The hearing was conducted on July 13, 2005.  At 
the hearing, Department Counsel introduced nine exhibits (Government Exhibits (GX) 1-9). Applicant testified and introduced 10 exhibits (Applicant's 
Exhibits (AX) A - J.  Applicant also submitted four timely post hearing exhibits (AX K-N).  All exhibits were admitted, without objection. The transcript was 
received by DOHA on July 21, 2005. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. The SOR contains six  allegations, 1.a.-1.f., under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct); three 
allegations, 2.a.-2.c., under Guideline G (Alcohol); and four allegations, 3.a.(1)-3.a.(3), and 3.b., under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Applicant admits all 
SOR allegations, with explanations. All admissions are accepted and made Findings of Fact. </P> 
<P> </P> 
<P>After considering the totality of  the evidence of record, I make the following FINDINGS OF FACT as to each SOR allegation.</P> 
<P>As alleged in the SOR, under:</P> 
<P> </P> 
<P><EM>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</EM></P> 
<P>1.a. - Applicant was arrested on September 17, 1981, in state A, and charged with Public Use of marijuana. He pleaded<EM> nolo contendere </EM>and was sentenced to 
pay a fine of $50.00; </P> 
<P>1.b. - Applicant was arrested on December 19, 1984, in State A, and charged with Count (1) Resisting Arrest and Count (2) Disorderly Conduct.  He pleaded no 
contest to Count (2) and was sentenced to probation and to pay court costs. Count (1) was dismissed;</P> 
<P>1.c. - Applicant was indicted on August 30, 1989, on two counts involving a Controlled Substance in the Third Degree, a felony. He pleaded no contest and the 
imposition of sentence was suspended for two years, contingent on his completion of probation, 120 hours of community service, payment of $200 restitution, 
and submission of fingerprints; </P> 
<P>1.d. - Applicant was arrested on February 4, 1996 in State B, and charged with two counts of Count (1) Operating a Motor Vehicle while Intoxicated; and Count 
(2) Unreasonable and Imprudent Speed.  He pleaded guilty to Count (1) and was sentenced to pay fines and costs of approximately $826, complete an alcohol 
assessment, and to have his driver's license suspended for six months. Count (2) was dismissed;     </P> 
<P>1.e. - Applicant was indicted on January 15, 2003 in State A and charged with Failing to Render Assistance to Injured Person after Accident, a felony.  He 
entered a no contest plea and was sentenced to 12 months in jail, suspended, and two years' probation.  He was ordered not to consume or possess alcohol, to 
obtain substance abuse screening and evaluation, to not consume or possess alcohol, and to remain on probation until July 2005;   </P> 
<P>1.f. - Applicant was arrested on April 17, 2004, in State A, and charged with Speeding and Violation of Probation.  His blood Alcohol level was tested as .026% 
and he was found to have an opened bottle of wine in his vehicle.  His probation was modified. He served four days in jail and was ordered to obtain a 
substance abuse evaluation within 60 days and comply with recommendations to not consume alcohol, and to remain on probation until July 2005.  The period 
of probation ended on July 29, 2005 (AX L).</P> 
<P><EM>Guideline G (Alcohol)</EM></P> 
<P>2.a. Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication from 1979 to at least December 8, 2004, and then again as late as June or 
July 2005, only a few weeks before the hearing (Tr at 63). </P> 
<P>2.b. - the information in SOR 1.d., 1.e., and 1.f., above.</P> 
<P>2.c. - Applicant continued to consume alcohol, notwithstanding the probation requirements that he abstain from alcohol, as set forth in SOR 1.e. and 1.f., above</P> 
<P>I note the August 5, 2005 letter from a Mental Health Clinician who had just begun providing counseling services to Applicant, with a full assessment to be 
completed in 30 days. (AX M).  This is certainly a positive move by Applicant, but the weight to be given it is minimized by the recency of the effort and the 
fact that Applicant's alcohol use continued until as recently as December 2004.  </P> 
<P>I also give considerable weight to the positive letters of recommendation from Applicant's friends and colleagues (AX A- J). In AX N, dated August 11, 2005, 
both writers had experience with family members with alcohol problems, as Applicant says he did, but neither cites any knowledge of Applicant's criminal 
history, which is a major part of the Government's concerns.</P> 
<P>   </P> 
<P><EM>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</EM></P> 
<P>3.a. - Applicant falsified material facts in response to Question <STRONG>27 Your Use of  Illegal Drugs and Drugs Activity - Illegal Use of Drugs </STRONG>[since the age of 16 
or in the last seven years].  He answered "No" and deliberately omitted any mention of his use of the following drugs, because "it was embarrassing" (Tr at 67): </P> 
<P>(1) his use of cocaine, including crack cocaine, with varying frequency, from about 1993 to at least February 1999;</P> 
<P>(2) his use of marijuana, with varying frequency,  from about 1993 to at least February 1999, and again on his birthday on June 10, 2005, just a month before 
the hearing (Tr at 71).  </P> 
<P>(3) his use of methamphetamine (speed), with varying frequency,  from about 1996 to at least February 1997.</P> 
<P>3.b. - Applicant falsified material facts on June 5, 2003 in a sworn statement given to an agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS). <STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant</P> 
<P>in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding</P> 
<P>the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the</P> 
<P>individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)</P> 
<P>the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation</P> 
<P>for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood</P> 
<P>of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my 
overall conclusion.</P> 
<P>The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related 
to the ultimate question of</P> 
<P>whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  An applicant's admission of the information in specific 
allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are denied or  otherwise controverted by the 
applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden 
(either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence</P> 
<P>of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is 44 years old.  His admitted conduct, as cited in the SOR raises serious question about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness under three 
separate guidelines of DoD Directive 5220.6.  I find all of the allegations in the SOR to be supported by the Government's evidence. I have carefully considered 
all of Applicant's explanations, in the context of the overall record evidence.  As discussed below, nothing in the record  establishes adequate mitigation or 
extenuation of any of the SOR  allegations. </P> 
<P><STRONG><EM>Criminal Conduct </EM></STRONG><EM></EM>- Applicant's long history of criminal activity began in 1981, when he was 20 years old, and continued up to the recent past. The six separate 
incidents in 1981, 1984, 1989, 1996, 2003, and April 2004, involved drug possession, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, driving while intoxicated, 
speeding, and/or probation violation. Applicant's explanations and testimony suggest that his conduct should be viewed in the context of the difficult family 
problems he has faced overt years and the realities of living where he does. I have spent considerable time in his area of the country and have heard testimony 
from dozens of men and women similarly situated. </P> 
<P>The evidence compels the conclusion that Applicant is ultimately responsible for his own conduct and that criminal activity is a part of Applicant's character, 
and not an aberration in an otherwise  law abiding and trustworthy individual.  </P> 
<P>I have carefully considered Applicant's work record and the letters of recommendation submitted by his colleagues and friends. The fact remains however that 
Applicant's criminal conduct has not diminished with the passage of time, but seems to have increased during the past few years.</P> 
<P>Disqualifying Conditions (DC) (1) - any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged and (2) a single serious crime or multiple 
lesser offenses are established but none of the parallel Mitigating Conditions has been shown; e.g., the criminal activity is still recent (MC (1)) and is not an 
isolated incident (MC (2)).   </P> 
<P><STRONG><EM>Guideline G (Alcohol)</EM></STRONG><EM></EM> - Applicant has consumed alcohol since 1979, when he was 18.  He admits continuing to consume alcohol until at least December 8, 
2004, only seven months before the hearing.  His alcohol abuse resulted in three alcohol-related arrests and convictions, in 1996, 2003, and 2004, cited in SOR 
1.d., 1.e., and 1.f.  As part of these convictions, he was ordered not to drink or possess alcohol, to complete an alcohol assessment, and to be on probation until 
July 2005.  The record, including his admissions, establishes that he continued to consume alcohol, not withstanding  all of the above and, in particular, the 
probation requirements cited in SOR 1.e. and 1.f. </P> 
<P>Disqualifying Conditions (DC) (1) - alcohol-related incidents away from work and (4) habitual or binge consumption to the point of impaired judgment are 
applicable, but none of the parallel Mitigating Conditions has been established by the record.    </P> 
<P><STRONG><EM>Personal Conduct </EM></STRONG><EM></EM>- Applicant clearly provided an incorrect answer in his security clearance application to Question 27.  After considering his explanations, the 
record compels the conclusion that Applicant knew and had reason to know he was answering falsely and that the false answer was a deliberate attempt to 
deceive DoD. The same holds true as to his failure to mention his cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamine use as cited in SOR 3.a.910., 3.a.(2), and 3.a.(3), 
above, when being interviewed by a DSS agent on June 5, 2003.   </P> 
<P>Applicant's last word of explanation (AX K) is that he falsified his 2000 security clearance application, because he "thought at the time that it would do more 
harm than good, now I know that the truth is the best and only answer."<A HREF="03-19302.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  </P> 
<P>Disqualifying Condition (2) is applicable - a "deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security 
questionnaire . . .," as is DC (3) - deliberately providing false information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator . . . in connection with a 
personnel security or trustworthiness determination.  None of the parallel Mitigating Conditions have been shown by the record. </P> 
<P>I have given consideration to Applicant's evidence that he has attended numerous meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), has completed alcohol education 
classes, has focused on raising his children. And has the incentive to avoid old habits (AX L).</P> 
<P>It is difficult not to sympathize with Applicant's efforts to improve his life and take care of his family, but it is simply impossible to conclude from the overall 
record that the multiple problems causing the Government's concerns are under control and are unlikely to recur.  Indeed, the evidence shows his problems 
have continued or recurred up to the recent past.  He simply has not met the burden of demonstrating mitigation or extenuation.  A year must pass after this 
decision becomes final before Applicant can request reconsideration of his security clearance eligibility.  Applicant will have the opportunity to follow through 
on his efforts and document what he has done.    </P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>BARRY M. SAX</STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE </STRONG></P> 
<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A> AX K references a "2003 Security Clearance Application" in which he says he answered "honestly and truthfully."  There is no such 2003 document in the 
case file or referenced in it.  I conclude Applicant is writing about the sworn statement he gave to DSS in December 2003, in which he did discuss his drug use.  
In context, however, it is more likely than not he is talking  about the sworn statement, in which he was responding to questions from an agent who had the 
arrest and other records with him.  In any case, the statement was more than two years after he had lied on his security clearance application. I find no mitigation 
for the falsification.
