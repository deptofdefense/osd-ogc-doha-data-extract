<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On March 31, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 30, 2005, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Arthur 
E. Marshall, Jr. denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline B is arbitrary, capricious or 
contrary to law.<A HREF="04-04004.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant contends that the Administrative Judge's unfavorable clearance decision should be reversed because it is Applicant's husband's family members, not 
her family members, that are citizens and residents of Yemen.  Applicant also argues that her evidence was sufficient, as a matter of law, to mitigate the 
government's security concerns under the whole person concept.  In support of her arguments, Applicant cites to a number of Hearing Office decisions in which 
applicants with ostensibly similar cases were granted clearances.  The Board does not find Applicant's arguments persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The decisions in other DOHA Hearing Office cases cited by Applicant on appeal do not demonstrate error by the Administrative Judge in this case.  A decision 
by a Hearing Office Judge is not legally binding precedent on that Judge's colleagues in other cases, even if Applicant establishes close factual similarities 
between the cited cases and the instant case.  ISCR Case No. 03-23776 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 13, 2006).  Likewise, the cited cases are not legally binding 
precedent on the Board.  ISCR Case No. 01-22606 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2003).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant had the burden of presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate facts that Department Counsel proved or that Applicant admitted 
regarding her family ties to Yemen, and Applicant also had the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security clearance decision. Directive &para; 
E3.1.15.  The Administrative Judge had to consider the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate the facts and circumstances of 
Applicant's past  and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide whether Applicant had met her burden of persuasion 
under Directive &para; E3.1.15. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">There is a rebuttable presumption that the Administrative Judge considered all of the evidence presented.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM>, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 
4, 2001).  The fact that Applicant's explanations and her mitigating evidence did not lead the Judge to the decision desired by Applicant does not establish 
error.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the 
Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice versa</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.  An applicant's 
disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the 
Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A review of the Administrative Judge's decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the 
disqualifying circumstances, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant with 
respect to most of the SOR allegations and articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying any mitigating conditions or factors with respect to the 
remaining allegations.  He reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government's 
security concerns.  Foreign connections not based on birth can raise security concerns under Guideline B.  Therefore, the Judge's decision is not rendered 
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law because Applicant's relationships with Yemen citizens are based on her marriage. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 
4 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Given the record that was before him, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline B is sustainable.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Finally, as the Administrative Judge noted in his decision, Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of 
Executive Order 10865 specifically  provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P>
