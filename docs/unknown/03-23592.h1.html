<P>Applicant is a 41-year-old defense contractor employee. Between 1997 and 2001, the police arrested him three times for lewd and lascivious behavior in a 
public place. He pled guilty to these charges. The court fined him and sentenced him to community service and unsupervised probation. He has not mitigated 
the government's security concerns regarding his sexual behavior and criminal conduct. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On December 21, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline D, Sexual Conduct, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, of the Directive. DOHA 
recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. </P> 
<P>On January 19, 2005, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. He requested a hearing. This matter was assigned to me on September 13, 
2005. A notice of hearing was issued on September 26, 2005, and a hearing was held on October 11, 2005. Nine Government Exhibits and one Applicant 
Exhibit were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record was held open to allow Applicant to submit additional documentary 
evidence. He submitted the additional documentation to which no government objection was made. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on October 19, 
2005.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>

<P>On October 9, 2001, late in the evening, an undercover police officer approached him and engaged him in conversation in a public park.<A HREF="03-23592.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A> They talked for more

</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. An administrative judge need 
not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when 
applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the adjudicative process provision in Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive, are intended to assist the 
administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. </P> 
<P>Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. In addition, each security clearance 
decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. 
Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of 
the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="03-23592.h1.html#N_51_"><SUP> (51)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-23592.h1.html#N_52_"><SUP> (52)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="03-23592.h1.html#N_53_"><SUP> (53)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against him.<A HREF="03-23592.h1.html#N_54_"><SUP> (54)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-23592.h1.html#N_55_"><SUP> (55)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-23592.h1.html#N_56_"><SUP> (56)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-23592.h1.html#N_57_"><SUP> (57)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="03-23592.h1.html#N_58_"><SUP> (58)</SUP></A> Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national 
interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned." The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.<A HREF="03-23592.h1.html#N_59_"><SUP> (59)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
<P><STRONG>Sexual Behavior - Guideline D: Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, 
may subject the individual to coercion, exploitation, or duress or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.</STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct - Guideline J: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></P> 
<P>In addition, the Directive advises adjudicators in cases involving Guideline D issues to consider guidelines pertaining to both criminal conduct (Guideline J) 
and emotional, mental and personality disorders (Guideline I) in determining how to resolve the security concerns raised by sexual behavior. In this particular 
case, a Guideline J issue is already alleged in the SOR.<A HREF="03-23592.h1.html#N_60_"><SUP> (60)</SUP></A> Accordingly, the following guideline is also pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case: 
Emotional, Mental and personality Disorders.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the 
allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
<P>Guideline D specifically states that sexual orientation or preference may not be used as a basis for or a disqualifying factor. Accordingly, in deciding whether to 
grant a clearance, I have focused only on Applicant's conduct.</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline D as to allegations 1.a through 1.d and 1.f. Based on all the evidence, Sexual Behavior Disqualifying 
Condition (SB DC) E2.A4.1.2.1. (<EM>Sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted</EM>), SB DC E2.A4.1.2.3. (<EM>Sexual 
behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM>) and SB DC E2.A4.1.2.4. (<EM>Sexual behavior of a public nature and/or 
that which reflects lack of discretion or judgment</EM>) apply. Applicant has been arrested three times for sexual conduct in a public park and performed in a public 
manner. He pled guilty to each of the resulting misdemeanor charges. His decision to seek sexual gratification in a public area and not to discuss his sexuality 
with his family could leave him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or duress and shows a lack of judgment.</P> 
<P>Applicant's reluctance to discuss his sexuality with his family make him more vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or duress. I have concerns about his failure 
to correct his criminal conduct after his initial arrest in 1997. Although he understands that his inappropriate decision making in regards to where he should 
seek sexual gratification are detrimental to him and to his job, he continued to conduct himself inappropriately for a significant period of time, leading to 
additional criminal arrests in 2001. Just prior to his arrest, he told an uncover police officer about numerous other locations, including parks, where men met 
each other. He clearly knew public places where men met for sexual gratification. Such sexual conduct in a public place violated the law and placed him in a 
more vulnerable position. The record is silent as to whether he ever returned to any park for the purpose of meeting men after his arrest in 2001. He has not 
been arrested in the last four years for anything. However, since it was four years between his first two arrests and his most recent arrest, which occurred four 
years ago, I conclude Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition (SBMC) E2.A4.1.3.2. (<EM>The behavior was not recent and there is no evidence of subsequent 
conduct of a similar nature</EM>) does not apply.</P> 
<P>The government has not established its case regarding allegation 1.e. Applicant denied this allegation and the government failed to produce evidence to support 
the allegation. He credibly testified that he had no plans to return to the parks to engage in sexual conduct, and his testimony is supported by the absence of 
more recent sexual conduct in a public place since 2001.</P> 
<P>In reviewing this matter under Guideline I, Emotional, Mental and Personality Disorders, Disqualifying Conditions (EMPD DC) E2.A9.1.2.3. (<EM>A pattern of 
high-risk, irresponsible, aggressive, anti-social or emotionally unstable behavior</EM>) and E2.A9.1.2.4. (<EM>Information that suggests that the individual's current 
behavior indicates a defect in his or her judgment or reliability</EM>) apply<EM>.</EM> Applicant's three arrests for lewd and lascivious acts along with his extensive 
knowledge of public locations for this conduct shows a pattern of high-risk, irresponsible and anti-social behavior. His decision to continue his conduct after 
being arrested shows a lack of judgment and poor decision making. None of the mitigating conditions apply.</P> 
<P>Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government's case under Guideline D. Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, allegations 1.a. through 1.d. 
and 1.f. of the SOR are concluded against Applicant. Allegation 1.e. is concluded in his favor.</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline J. Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. (<EM>Allegation or admission of 
criminal misconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>) and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2. (<EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>) 
apply. Applicant was arrested for lewd and lascivious behavior in a public place, misdemeanor criminal offenses, on three occasions between 1997 and 2001. 
He pled guilty after each arrest. The courts fined him and sentenced him to community service and unsupervised probation.</P> 
<P>I considered the Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) and conclude that none apply. While Applicant's two arrests in 1997 are eight years old, his 
most recent arrest four years ago happened four years after his previous arrests. The record evidence clearly indicates that between 1997 and 2001, he continued 
seeking sexual gratification in public places. He has not been arrested in four years, the same length of time between his 1997 and 2001 arrests. Thus, sufficient 
time has not elapsed. While he has maintained steady employment for the last 13 years, improved his financial record, and earned the trust of his employer 
because of his work skills and ethics, there is insufficient evidence that he has changed his sexual conduct completely. Accordingly, Applicant has failed to 
mitigate the government's case under Guideline J. </P> 
<P>For the reasons stated, I find that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant.</P>
