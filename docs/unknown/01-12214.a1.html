  The Administrative Judge's factual findings about Applicant's embezzlement of more than $49,000 from his employer from November 1997 until January 1999 are sustainable.  The Judge did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner in weighing the favorable evidence presented by Applicant.  Decisions  by DOHA Hearing Office Judges may be cited as persuasive authority, but they are not binding on Hearing Office Judges in other cases nor are they binding on  the Board.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>Administrative Judge Burt Smith issued a decision dated June 20, 2002, in which he concluded that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.</P> 
 
<P>The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: 1. Did the Administrative Judge err in his findings of fact; and 2. Did the Administrative Judge err by not 
finding that Applicant mitigated the act of embezzlement from his employer.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's adverse 
security clearance decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, dated January 7, 2002.  The SOR was based of 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  Applicant requested a hearing which was held on 
April 30, 2002.  Subsequently the Administrative Judge issued an unfavorable decision.  The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from that decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 
2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly 
detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 
87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P>

<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Did the Administrative Judge err in his findings of fact</SPAN>?  Applicant does not dispute the Administrative Judge's findings that Applicant was addicted to 
gambling and that he embezzled more than $49,000 from his employer from November 1997 until January 1999.  Applicant challenges the Judge's findings that 
Applicant only confessed to the embezzlement when he was caught and that his involvement with Gambler's Anonymous was a result of his being caught.  
Applicant asserts that the evidence shows that he joined Gambler's Anonymous and then voluntarily confessed to the embezzlement before he was caught by 
his employer.  Applicant argues that the timing of these events was critical to a determination of the extent of his reform.  The Administrative Judge's 
challenged findings of fact represent a sustainable reading of the record evidence.  Applicant's ability to present an alternative interpretation of the record is not 
sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge erred.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Did the Administrative Judge err by not finding that Applicant mitigated the act of embezzlement from his employer</SPAN>?  Applicant makes several arguments in 
support of his claim that he mitigated the act of embezzling funds from his employer.  Applicant argues that (a) he has been successfully rehabilitated; (b) he 
has overcome  his gambling addiction and is no longer subject to pressure; and (c) his period of recovery exceeds those found in other case histories in which 
DOHA has granted security clearances.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant argues that he has been successfully rehabilitated.  In support of this argument, he cites his history of holding increasingly responsible positions 
(including at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001), his long work history, his holding positions of trust, and his success with Gambler's Anonymous.  
Applicant argues that his situation is covered by Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition E2.A10.1.3.6.<A HREF="01-12214.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Applicant's arguments are unpersuasive.  Applicant's 
ability to cite to evidence from the record in his favor is not enough to demonstrate that the Administrative Judge erred.  The Judge must consider the record 
evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  The Board will not disturb a Judge's 
weighing of the evidence unless there is a showing the Judge acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Administrative Judge 
explicitly considered the cited Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition, however, he did not find it dispositive in this case.  Considering the record as a whole, 
the Board is not persuaded that the Administrative Judge erred in his analysis of Applicant's rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant argues that he has overcome his gambling addiction and is therefore not subject to pressure to commit additional acts of embezzlement because of it.  
He argues that Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition E2.A.10.1.3.3.<A HREF="01-12214.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> should have been applied by the Judge.  Applicant's argument is unpersuasive.  While 
the Administrative Judge found for Applicant with regard to his gambling, this favorable finding did not mandate a finding that the acts of embezzlement were 
also mitigated.  The Judge concluded that the gambling was a separate matter from the calculated act of embezzlement.  This conclusion was reasonably 
supported by the record evidence.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Administrative Judge erred on this matter.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant cites several DOHA cases, and argues that his period of recovery and rehabilitation exceeds that of other individuals granted clearances.  Although 
decisions by Hearing Office Judges may be cited as persuasive authority, they are not binding on other Hearing Office Judges in other cases nor are they binding 
on the Appeal Board.  Furthermore many of the cases cited by Applicant are factually distinguishable from Applicant's case.  Applicant's reliance on decisions 
in other DOHA cases fails to demonstrate the Judge's decision in arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P>Applicant has failed to demonstrate the Administrative Judge erred.  Therefore, the decision below is affirmed.</P>
