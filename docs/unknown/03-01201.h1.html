<P>The Applicant has filed his federal income tax returns for tax years 1995, 1996 and 1997.  Tax years 1995 and 1996 have been paid in full.  He is making 
payments towards his 1997 back taxes.  There is also an outstanding judgment, however, in an amount in excess of $70,000.  In a July 2003 sworn statement, he 
averred he was not willing to pay it.  At his hearing he reiterated he would not voluntarily pay this judgment.  He has a positive monthly cash flow in excess of 
$5,600.  He did not wilfully falsify his Security Clearance Application (SCA) as to the existence of the before mentioned outstanding judgment.  Mitigation is 
not shown as to his financial considerations.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 5, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on November 17, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on February 6, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on February 17, 2004, and the case was heard on February 23, 
2004.  The Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant.  The transcript was received on March 11, 2004.  The 
issues raised here are whether the Applicant's current financial considerations, and alleged personal and criminal conduct militate against the granting of a 
security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of all the allegations, except as to his failure to file his federal income tax returns, 
subparagraphs 1.a. and 3.a., which he denies.]</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">56 years of age, and is 
employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant</SPAN>.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations, Guideline E - Personal Conduct &amp; Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>1.a. and 2.a.  The Applicant owes about $70,000 on an outstanding judgment to a former business associate (Transcript (TR) at page 43 line 8 to page 45 line 9, 
and Government Exhibit (GX) 3 at page 2, and GX 18).  In a July 2003 sworn statement, he averred he was not willing to pay the outstanding judgment (GX 4 
at page 4).  At his hearing, the Applicant reiterated that he would not voluntarily pay this outstanding judgment (TR at page 18 line 25 to page 19 line 9, at page 
23 line 6 to page 24 line 9 and at page 27 lines 14~19).  He has involuntarily paid about $2,200~$2,300 toward this past due indebtedness (TR at page 43 line 8 
to page 45 line 9).  The Applicant has a positive monthly cash flow in excess of $5,600 (TR at page 30 line 20 to page 31 line 2).</P> 
 
<P>1.b. and 3.a.  The Applicant has filed his federal income tax for tax years 1995, 1996 and 1997 (TR at page 21 line 13 to page 22 line 25 line 21, <EM>see also 
</EM>Applicant's Exhibit (AppX) C).  He has paid his back taxes for tax years 1995 and 1996 in full, and is paying $555 each month towards his back taxes for tax 
year 1997 (TR at page 46 line 8 to page 49 line 2).  It will be paid in full in one month (TR at page 29 line 3 to page 30 line 5).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>2.b.  The Applicant did not wilfully falsify his May 2001 SCA when he answered Question 37 "No" as to any unpaid judgements (GX 1 at page 8).  He 
disclosed the existence of this judgement when he answered question 40 on the same page of his SCA (TR at page 25 line 12 to page 26 line 11, at page 27 
lines 7~13, at page 41 line 4 to page 43 line 7, and GX 1 at pages 8~9).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant has received numerous awards and recognitions in conjunction with his employment (AppX A).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern, and which must 
be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">should be followed in every case</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according to the pertinent 
criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance 
on his own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these 
conditions exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Financial Considerations</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Criminal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) 
which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an 
applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective 
or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Government must be able to place a high 
degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has filed and paid, or is in the process of paying, all of his alleged back taxes.  Since he has filed all of his federal income tax returns, there is no 
continuing criminal conduct.  Guideline J is therefore found for the Applicant.  However, he does have an outstanding judgment pending against him in the 
amount of about $70,000.  Despite having a positive monthly cash flow in excess of $5,600, the Applicant has repeatedly averred that he is unwilling to 
voluntarily address this past due.  Disqualifying condition 3 is thus clearly applicable in this case, as there is an "unwillingness to satisfy debts."  His current 
financial intransigence is clearly of present security significance.  Guideline F is therefore found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to his alleged falsification under Personal Conduct, I can find none.  The Applicant had absolutely no intention of keeping the existence of his judgement 
from the purview of the Government.  He in fact disclosed its existence on his SCA, three questions later, on the same page as the posited question at issue.  
Guideline E is therefore found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his Financial Considerations.  The Applicant has thus not met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline F, and of Section E2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>
