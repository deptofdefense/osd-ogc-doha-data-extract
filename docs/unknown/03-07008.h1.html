<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From 1988 to 2000, Applicant was charged with five different criminal offenses, two related to the illegal possession of firearms and three to drug-related 
misconduct. He was convicted twice for drug-related misconduct. In 2002, Applicant submitted a SF 86 in which he deliberately failed to disclose the above

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 19, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security 
concerns under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR informed Applicant that, 
based on information available to the government, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant him access to classified information.<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber3"></A>On August 9, 2005, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer). He admitted the allegations in subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f, 2.a, and 3.d. He denied the 
allegations in subparagraphs 3.a through 3.c, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on October 6, 2005. On November 14, 2005, I convened a 
hearing at which the government presented five exhibits, marked GE 1-5, to support the SOR.<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant testified and presented four exhibits that were 
admitted without objection and marked AE 1-4.<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 28, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following 
additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 36 years old, has never been married, and lives with his fifteen-year-old son. He obtained a GED in 1989 and, thereafter, held several unskilled 
jobs. In 1998, he began working as a mail courier for a company that was later acquired by a defense contractor. In light of his good performance, he is now 
working as an assistant supervisor and requires a clearance upgrade from a postal clearance to a top secret clearance. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From 1988 to 2000, Applicant was charged with criminal misconduct seven times. The charges stem from five different incidents. In 1988, Applicant was 
convicted of attempted possession of cocaine and sentenced to two years probation. Although he denies ever using drugs, the court required him to complete 
drug rehabilitation treatment. In 1989, he was charged with possession of an unregistered gun and an ammunition violation. The charges were dismissed. In 
1991, he was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. The charge was later dismissed. In 1994, he was charged with carrying a pistol 
without a license and receiving stolen property. The charge was dismissed. In 1995, these charges were resurrected and Applicant was again charged with 
carrying a pistol without a license, possession of a prohibited weapon, and unlawful possession of ammunition. The charges were later dismissed. Finally, in 
September 2000, Applicant was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. The charge was initially dismissed and then re-filed in 2001. 
Applicant entered into a plea agreement and cooperated with the government in the prosecution of his drug supplier. In the process, his case was deferred until 
October 2004, when he was convicted and placed on probation for five years. Applicant will be on probation until March 2009.<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In January 2002, Applicant submitted a SF 86<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> in which he deliberately provided false answers to questions 21, 22, 23, and 29. He answered "YES" to question 
21, which asked whether he had ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense.<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> He then disclosed his 1988 felony charge for distribution of 
cocaine as  "possession of a controlled substance," and his 2000 charge for possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute as  "possession of controlled 
substance." He failed, however, to disclose his January 1991 felony charge of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered "NO" to SF 86 question 22, which asked whether he had ever been charged with or convicted of a firearms offense. He failed to disclosed 
his firearms related charges of 1989, 1994, and 1995.<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> He answered "NO" to question 23, which asked whether he had charges pending against him. He failed 
to disclose that in December 2001, he had been charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute after the original charge of September 2000 was 
dismissed. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Additionally, he answered "NO" to question 29, which inquired about his use of illegal drugs and drug activity (purchase, sale, transfer, and trafficking) within 
the last seven years. He failed to disclose he had sold cocaine/crack cocaine for profit from about 1995 to at least September 2000, when he was charged with 
possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. He also failed to disclose he sold drugs for profit, at least twice, shortly prior to his drug-related arrest in 
September 2000.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Applicant averred he never intended to falsify his answers or to deceive the government. He claimed he was confused by the SF 86 questions 
and offered multiple inconsistent explanations for his omissions. Foremost amongst his explanations was that he answered the questions based on his record as 
it existed in 1998. In June 1998, Applicant applied for his mail clerk job, and knowing that he would be asked about his criminal background, he requested his 
criminal record from his state's police department.<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> That document does not list Applicant's 1995, 1994, 1991, and 1989 charges or his 1988 conviction. In 
January 2002, with full knowledge of his past criminal history, Applicant omitted this from his SF 86 because it was not reflected in his criminal record. His 
testimony and demeanor leads me to conclude he thought the government or his employer would not find out about his past criminal behavior since it was not 
reflected in his criminal record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's other explanations included: he made the mistake of believing he only had to disclose convictions; he did not know some of the charges were for 
felony offenses; he was directed by the court not to disclose to anyone that the September 2000 charges had been re-filed because he was cooperating with the 
government;<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and he did not disclose he had been selling drugs during the last seven years because, even though he had been selling drugs on and off, he had 
not been selling drugs continuously during the seven year period.<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified he sold drugs for profit and expressed remorse for dealing drugs and for the mistakes he made completing the SF 86. He explained his 
behavior is the product of the bad environment in which he grew up. He comes from a poor family located in a bad neighborhood. His older family members 
steered him, at early age, into the drug trade. He said his father was a heroin addict who died of an overdose, his cousins, uncles, and brother were addicted to 
drugs and trafficked drugs. Applicant's brother was shot 16 times as a result of a drug transaction and is now confined to a wheel chair.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As a youngster, Applicant sold cocaine at least twice a month and used his "earnings" to purchase shoes and clothes.<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Applicant also testified he sold drugs six 
times between 1988 and 2000. He sold drugs whenever he needed clothes or wanted something.<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Applicant claimed he decided to stop selling drugs after his 
mother died in September 2000. He was 30 years old when he was arrested and charged with possession of 50 grams of cocaine with intent to distribute, two 
days after his mother died. He averred that he was not selling drugs continuously, but that he needed the money to bury his mother. Notwithstanding this last 
statement, Applicant also testified he sold cocaine a couple of times before his mother died "just to have money in his pocket."<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> He had been working for his 
current employer since 1998.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant claimed he no longer sells drugs and that he has changed his lifestyle. He has new friends, and he moved to a different state to avoid associating with 
other drug users, including those who purchased their drugs from him. Applicant's probation supervisor confirmed he has complied with the conditions of his 
probation. There is no evidence he has been involved in any additional drug-related misconduct since his arrest in September 2000. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has dedicated his life to his work, setting a good example for his son, and participating in his son's activities. He loves his job and needs his job to be 
able to take care of his son. He is considered an excellent employee with extraordinary customer service skills.<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified 
information. The administrative judge most take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the 
facts and circumstances of the case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and <A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber9"></A>impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the 
Directive,<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> and the whole person concept.<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or 
against an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy 
guidance governing the granting or denial of access to classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct), Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> are the applicable relevant adjudicative guidelines.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> for an applicant to either receive or continue 
to have access to classified information. The government has the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must establish a prima facie case that it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest for the applicant to have access to classified information. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's 
case. Because no one has a right to a security <A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber10"></A>clearance, the applicant carries a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information 
enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest to ensure each 
applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly 
consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for access to classified information in 
favor of protecting national security.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). A history or pattern of criminal conduct is a security concern because it may indicate an unwillingness to abide by rules and 
regulations and may show the applicant to be lacking in judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> The government established its case under Guideline J by 
showing that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant was convicted of drug-related offenses in April 1988 and October 2004. Further, he was involved in additional criminal misconduct in 
November 1989, January 1991, and May 1994. I conclude Guideline J DC 1: <EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person 
was formally charged,</EM><A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> and DC 2: <EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,</EM><A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> apply. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">I have considered all Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> and find that none apply. Applicant was raised in a culture of drugs and, by his own admission, 
has been selling drugs for profit since an early age. He was convicted in 1988, placed on probation, and required to undergo drug rehabilitation treatment. 
Notwithstanding, he did not learn from his mistake as demonstrated by his illegal possession of firearms in 1989 and 1994, possession of cocaine with intent to 
distribute in 1991, and his 2004 conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in 2000. He was 30 years old at the time he perpetrated the last 
offense, employed and possessed a postal clearance, and committed the drug offense just two days after his mother's death. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under the totality of the circumstances, I find Applicant's criminal behavior is recent and not isolated. Although Applicant's last offense occurred in 2000, his 
falsification in 2002 brings to the forefront the security concerns raised by his criminal behavior. Further, even though not alleged in the SOR, I must consider 
in my analysis under whole person concept<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> that his falsification of the SF 86 is a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001.<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">As such, his falsification weighs against the 
presence of rehabilitation and positive behavioral changes. In light of the many years he sold drugs, the nature and seriousness of his behavior, the fact that he 
has been under the close scrutiny of the courts since 2000, and his recent falsification, Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate his 
successful rehabilitation and/or that the factors leading to his criminal behavior are not likely to recur. Guideline J is decided against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline H (Drug Involvement). Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect 
classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information. Such conduct may also be criminal and indicative of a disregard for rules and regulations in place to protect national interests.<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> The government 
established its case under Guideline H by showing that Applicant sold drugs with varying frequency, from around 1988 until December 2000. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Further, the 
government established that Applicant received drug rehabilitation treatment after his 1988 conviction and continued his drug-related behavior until at least 
2000. Applicant's testimony leads me to conclude he sold drugs anytime he needed or wanted extra money. Guideline H DC 2: <EM>Illegal drug possession, ... 
purchase, sale, or distribution</EM>,<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> and DC 5: <EM>... recent drug involvement</EM><A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> <A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber12"></A>apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">I considered all the Guideline H Mitigating Conditions and, for the same reasons outlined above under the discussion of the Guideline J Mitigating Conditions 
(incorporated herein), I conclude none apply. Analyzing Applicant's case under the whole person concept, his falsification of the SF 86 and the fact that he has 
minimized his drug behavior, weigh against mitigating the Guideline H concerns. His illegal involvement with drugs raises questions about his ability and 
willingness to follow the law, and ultimately, to protect classified information. I find Guideline H against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline E (Personal Conduct). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Personal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the ultimate question - whether a person's past conduct instills 
confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">An applicant's conduct is a security concern if it involves questionable 
judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such behavior could indicate that 
the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The government established its case under Guideline E by showing that Applicant deliberately provided false answers when he submitted his SF 86. Applicant 
chose not to disclose his criminal behavior, seemingly, because of his concern for the adverse impact this information would have had on his qualifications to 
obtain a security clearance. Applicant's explanations for his failure to disclose the information ring hollow in light of the totality of the facts and circumstances, 
including his age at the time he submitted the SF 86, his demeanor, and his prior statements.<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> I find Applicant's omissions were knowing and deliberate, and 
committed with the intent to mislead the government. He believed that because his criminal record was incorrect, the government would not find out about his 
criminal behavior and, therefore, he deliberately omitted the information. Guideline E Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, 
or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire ... </EM>,<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> and DC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM>Personal conduct or concealment of information that 
increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress ...,<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM> </EM>apply<EM>.</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant was 32 years old at the time he submitted the SF 86. In light of his past behavior - i.e., selling drugs for profit and his other run-ins with the law - his 
falsifications cannot be attributed to youthful exuberance or stupidity. He deserves credit for changing his lifestyle, for cooperating with the government, and 
for his concerns regarding the welfare of his son. Notwithstanding, his current behavior is not sufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised by his 
falsifications. I have considered all the Personal Conduct<A HREF="03-07008.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> Mitigating Conditions, and find that none apply. In light of all the facts and circumstances, I 
conclude Applicant's falsifications are relatively recent and that the motive that led him to falsify the SF 86 - i.e., his desire to cover up his criminal behavior - 
remains a viable factor that could influence Applicant's future behavior. As such, he is likely susceptible to influence, pressure, or coercion in order to cover up 
his past criminal behavior from prospective employers and others in his community. Guideline E is decided against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A>  I note that SOR allegation subparagraph 3.a mistakenly alleged that Applicant failed to disclose he was arrested in January 1991, for a felony charge. 
Consistent with SOR question 21, it should have alleged that Applicant failed to disclose he had been charged with or convicted of a felony offense. 
Notwithstanding the error, I find that the allegation provided Applicant with adequate notice, that he understood the government's concerns, was prepared for 
his hearing, and addressed the government's concerns. In his testimony, Applicant attempted to explain and mitigate his failure to disclose he had been charged 
with other felony offenses.
