<P><STRONG><U>STATEMENT OF CASE</U></STRONG></P>

<P>On September 23, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>"Safeguarding Classified Information
Within Industry,"</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>"Defense Industrial Personnel Security
Clearance Review Program"</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to ---------------------
(Applicant), which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P>

<P>A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</P>

<P>In a sworn written statement, dated October 15, 1996, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing.  The case was
assigned to Administrative Judge Kathryn Moen Braeman on November 6, 1996, but due to caseload considerations, was reassigned to, and received by, this
Administrative Judge on November 6, 1996.  A notice of hearing was issued on November 7, 1996, and the hearing was held before me on November 13,
1996.<A HREF="96-0681.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  During the course of the hearing, eight Government exhibits and no Applicant exhibits (none were offered),<A HREF="96-0681.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> and the testimony of one witness (the
Applicant), were received.  The transcript was received on November 26, 1996.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</STRONG></P>

<P>During the proceeding, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to the expected evidence.  Specifically, he sought to amend subparagraph 1.c.
thereof by deleting the figure $7,831.97, and substituting therefor the figure $5,315.00.  There being no objection by Applicant, the motion was granted, and the
SOR was amended as described above.</P>

<P><STRONG><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></STRONG></P>

<P>Applicant has admitted all of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations under Criterion F (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.p.).  Those admissions
are hereby incorporated herein as findings of fact.</P>

<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P>

<P>Applicant is a 62 year old male employed by a defense contractor, and he is seeking to obtain a SECRET clearance.  He was originally granted an earlier
security clearance in February 1962, which he held for a number of years.</P>

<P>Applicant has been financially overextended since about April 1989,<A HREF="96-0681.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> and as a consequence, he has established a history of not meeting his financial
obligations.  Notwithstanding his repeatedly declared intentions to resolve his outstanding financial obligations, he has demonstrated an inability or
unwillingness to satisfy them.</P>

<P>Applicant was gainfully employed in the defense industry, making about $75,000 per year, until about September 1988, when he became self-employed and
opened a franchise of a travel service company.  Cash flow difficulties eventually arose in Applicant's commercial relationships, and in an attempt to maintain
his business, he frequently advanced funds which were to have been reimbursed to his company by other organizations.  They were not.  The financial
difficulties of other companies, including the franchise holder, had a negative impact on his operation, and the absence of reimbursements, and an inability to
pay continuing business obligations, devastated his business.  Applicant eventually fell far behind in his financial obligations arising out of both his business and
his personal affairs, and his financial condition was out of control.</P>

<P>Applicant's inability to catch up on his finances resulted in accounts being charged off, turned over for collection, and in three instances (subparagraphs 1.b.,
1.h., and 1.k.), judgments were entered against him by creditors.  As he explained, he stopped contacting his creditors when it became an exercise in futility. 
Exacerbating Applicant's financial problems was his inability to return to the permanent workforce in a salaried position commensurate with his experience and
training.  During the period commencing in September 1988, and continuing until February 1995, Applicant was part of a workforce which was either self-employed, under-employed, or unemployed.  One employer during the period June-September 1991 went into bankruptcy.  In September 1994, he obtained part-time employment, and he held that position until he obtained his current position in February 1995.  He currently earns approximately $52,000 per year.  Adding
to his problems, Applicant's present employer has filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11.</P>

<P>Applicant currently has outstanding past due financial obligations, to a number of different creditors, in the approximate amount of $47,285.00.<A HREF="96-0681.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>  Of that
amount, $6,682.00 is attributed to business expenses (subparagraph 1.a.), and three accounts (subparagraphs 1.c., 1.f., and 1.l.), totaling approximately
$6,000.00 are speculated by Applicant to be the debts of his son -- a person with essentially the same name as Applicant.<A HREF="96-0681.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A>  Even if true, the remaining balance
of undisputed outstanding personal financial obligations would be about $34,600.00.</P>

<P>Applicant has repeatedly indicated an intention to satisfy all of his outstanding financial obligations, but to date, with the exception of the one informal third
party inquiry, has taken no action to resolve any of the debts.  On February 12, 1996 -- nine months prior to the hearing, he stated:<A HREF="96-0681.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A></P>

<P>I want to repay all of my debts, but I did not just want to go to them one at a time because I believe that the other creditors would then come after me and I
cannot afford to pay them all at one time.  I wanted to save some money in order to contact a financial advisor or credit counselor to see if the creditors would
negotiate a lesser amount as settlement on the accounts as soon as I have enough cash to do so.  I hope to be able to do this sometime in 1996.  I chose not to file
bankruptcy because I feel that I am liable to the payment of my debts.  I fully intend to repay all of my debts.  If after researching the accounts that I believe
pertain to my son, they are debts of mine, I intend to pay these debts.</P>

<P>Five months later, in July 1996, Applicant had not taken one single additional step to resolve his outstanding financial obligations.  Instead, he offered four
explanations for further inaction: 1) his current employer had filed for bankruptcy protection and owed Applicant unreimbursed expenses and vacation pay,
totaling about $1,000.00 to $1,200.00; 2) he had to obtain two secured credit cards for travel in connection with his job; 3) he had unexpected automobile
repairs totaling $2,500.00, as well as continuing auto lease payments of $400.00 per month; and 4) he has not been able to save any money to apply towards his
debts.</P>

<P>In his Response to SOR in October 1996, Applicant offered a fifth reason for his inaction: the debts have, for the most part, been charged off, and the creditors
have not been exerting any pressure on him to repay his debts.  During the hearing in November 1996, Applicant added a sixth reason for his failure to take any
further action: he was afraid to reopen the matter for fear of opening "Pandora's box."</P>

<P>In fact, during the past seven years, Applicant has taken no personal action to obtain counseling for the problem; to initiate a good-faith effort to repay any of the
overdue creditors; to satisfy any of the three judgments against him; to respond to at least one offer of settlement; or to resolve any issues pertaining to whether
some of the debts were his or those of his son.  Instead, he has offered a combination of promises, excuses, explanations, rationalizations, and justifications for
his inaction.</P>

<P>Applicant previously served on active military service from August 1952 until August 1956. He has been employed by his present employer since February
1995.  Co-workers, former subordinates, and long-term friends support his application, and have characterized him with such terms as trustworthiness,
discretion, dependable, and professional.</P>

<P><STRONG><U>POLICIES</U></STRONG></P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Factors) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual's
eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Factors).</P>

<P>An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision -- an expansion of the factors set forth in
Section F.3. of the Directive, are intended to assist the Administrative Judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P>

<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an
Administrative Judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P>

<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P>

<P><STRONG>[Financial Considerations - Criterion F]:  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P>

<P>(1) a history of not meeting financial obligations; </P>

<P>(3) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P>

<P>(3) the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation);</P>

<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount determinant, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="96-0681.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest."  For the purposes
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded that both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have endeavored to draw
only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have attempted to avoid drawing inferences
that are grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the Government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the Government
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient
to overcome the doubts raised by the Government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue
the applicant's clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that the Government must
be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to the potential for, rather than actual risk of, compromise of classified information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's loyalty and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865
specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than loyalty and patriotism.  Nothing in this
Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's loyalty or
patriotism.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT SIZE="-1">CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness testimony, demeanor, and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal
precepts and factors, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">With respect to Criterion F, the Government has established its case.  Applicant has been portrayed as a person who is financially overextended, with a history
of bad debts and delinquent or uncollectible accounts or debts written off by creditors as uncollectible losses, and who has displayed an indifference to, or
disregard of, those financial obligations, with little or no apparent or voluntary effort to satisfy them.  Based on the evidence, I conclude that the characterization
is a fair one.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Applicant's initial financial difficulties commenced after he had left a salaried position in the defense industry where he was earning approximately $75,000 per
year, and entered an entrepreneurial endeavor by opening his own franchise of a travel service company.  The business eventually faltered when cash flow
difficulties arose, and first Applicant's business, and then his personal, financial obligations escalated to a point beyond immediate repair.  Accounts were
charged off, turned over for collection, and judgments were entered against him.  Eventually, Applicant stopped contacting his creditors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">There is no evidence that Applicant had been living a lifestyle reflecting irresponsible, reckless, or improvident expenditures.  Rather, his initial financial
problems were exacerbated by factors largely beyond his control, namely business reverses.  His condition was further buffeted by his inability to return to the
permanent workforce in a salaried position commensurate with his experience and training, and his having spent significant periods of time, from September
1988, until February 1995, as part of a workforce which was either self-employed, under-employed, or unemployed.  He obtained his present position in
February 1995, and currently earns approximately $52,000 per year.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">While it is true that Applicant has repeatedly expressed an intention to satisfy his outstanding financial obligations, his inaction stands in stark contrast to his
declared intentions.  One fact is inescapable, and it is that during the past seven years, Applicant has taken no personal action to obtain counseling for the
problem; to initiate a good-faith effort to repay any of the overdue creditors; to satisfy any of the three judgments against him; to respond to at least one offer of
settlement; or to resolve any issues pertaining to whether some of the debts were his or those of his son.  Instead, he has exhibited an indifference to, and
disregard of, his outstanding financial obligations, both business and personal; seemingly attempted to ignore the situation; and offered a combination of hollow
promises, excuses, explanations, rationalizations, and justifications for his inaction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">I am not insensitive to the realities of life, and can empathize with Applicant's initial predicament.  However, despite his eventual employment -- whether it was
self-employment, under-employment, or his present employment at $52,000 per year, Applicant managed to earn a living sufficient to cover his current needs
and responsibilities, with something left over to be saved, invested, spent, or turned over to creditors.  It appears that he opened new lines of credit, saved some
money, invested some money, spent other money, and leased a car for $1,000 down, and $418.86 per month.<A HREF="96-0681.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A>  He has failed to offer any evidence of mitigation
other than professed good intentions, and simply chose to ignore the old creditors.  Moreover, he has repeatedly failed to follow-up on promises to initiate good-faith efforts to resolve his outstanding financial obligations.  His seven years of inaction, generally, and the period since February 1995, specifically, as well as
his repeated failures to initiate any such efforts, I find to be significant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">I do not take this position lightly, but based on the law, as set forth in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan,</EM> 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my evaluation of the evidence, my
application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under Enclosure 2 of the Directive, I believe that
Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the Government's case.  The evidence leaves me with grave questions and doubts as to Applicant's continued
security eligibility and suitability. Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.p. of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not suitable for access to classified information.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT SIZE="-1">FORMAL FINDINGS</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>It should be noted that while Item 8, Enclosure 3, of the Directive requires that an applicant be afforded at least 15 days notice in advance of the time and
place of the hearing, Applicant had previously waived that period, requested an expedited process, and agreed to proceed at the time and place proposed.  At the
hearing itself, Applicant again indicated a willingness to proceed.  <EM>See</EM>, Transcript (Tr.), at 9.
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>On November 14, 1996, one day after the record closed, a letter was submitted in Applicant's behalf by an attorney whom Applicant had previously identified
as his prospective representative.  No mention was made that the attorney was to have appeared as a witness, rather than as a representative.  Because no request
had been made by Applicant to keep the record open in anticipation of the submission, and the submission was made after the record had closed, I have not
considered the document nor the information appearing therein.
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>Despite the clear evidence of financial overextension, Applicant disputes the characterization, and minimizes the importance of the currency of the situation
by pointing out that the debts were incurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and he has managed to avoid accumulating any additional debts.  <EM>See</EM> Response to
SOR, at 2.
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>One creditor (subparagraph 1.d.) had offered to settle the account for $4,001.81, which was a discount of 50 percent, but Applicant made no personal effort to
do so.  He did, however, in February 1996, ask an unidentified third party to inquire about the account.  Also, Applicant contends that the debts identified in
subparagraphs 1.d. and 1.o. are the same debt, but he has offered no evidence to support his contention.  The two credit reports (Government Exhibits 4 and 8)
reflect the existence of two separate account numbers as well as different amounts owed.  Moreover, Applicant's own sworn statement of July 1996
(Government Exhibit 2, at 2 and 3) reflects them to be separate debts.  <EM>See contra</EM>, his sworn statement of February 1996 (Government Exhibit 5, at 4), wherein
he says they are the same debt.
