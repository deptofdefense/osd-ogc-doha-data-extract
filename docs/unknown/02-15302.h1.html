<P>Applicant was cited for multiple traffic-related violations (to include equipment violations, moving violations, the lack of a driver's license or proof of 
insurance in his possession, and failure to display inspection stickers).  Applicant attributes his encounters to bad timing and poor judgment.  His judgment 
lapses resulted in fines and warnings, in addition to dismissals of several of the issued citations.  But from his adverse experiences, he has learned to be more 
responsive in his driving habits and keeping his driver's license and proof of his insurance in his possession when he drives.  He is credited with meritorious 
contributions to both his employer and his community.  His aggregate efforts to date produce enough rehabilitation to mitigate security concerns associated with 
his past record of traffic-related citations.  Clearance is granted.  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 21, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under 
the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on June 16, 2003, and requested a hearing.  I was  assigned  this case on August 6, 2003, and scheduled it for hearing on 
September 24, 2003.  A hearing was convened on September 24, 2003, as scheduled, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of two exhibits; Applicant 
relied on two witnesses (including himself) and eight exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on October 2, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 44-year-old software test specialist for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated 21 traffic-related citations between 1984 and March 2000, for offenses ranging from equipment 
violations, moving violations, failure to have a driver's license in his possession, prohibited parking, lack of security verification, to failure to display a valid  
state inspection sticker.</P> 
 
<P>For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the covered allegations while claiming (a) they each involved minor traffic violations resulting in fines 
of less than $150.00, (b) several were dismissed, and (c)others were issued as warning tickets that should </P> 
 
<P>not held against him.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between 1984 and March 2000 (when he accumulated his last traffic citation), Applicant amassed some 21 traffic-related citations for assorted offenses, 
ranging from equipment violations, moving violations, failure to have a valid state driver's license in his possession, prohibited parking, lack of security 
verification (insurance) and failure to display a valid inspection sticker on the windshield of his car.  Applicant attributes his numerous assorted offenses to bad 
timing and failure to carry his driver's license and proof of auto insurance on with him when he was stopped by police.  In those instances in which he was cited 
for failure to show proof of a license or insurance, he consistently produced documentation of each within 48 hours of his citation.  In these cases where he was 
able to document his possession of a valid state driver's license and insurance, the citations were dismissed (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 29).  Of the 21 traffic citations he was 
issued, seven were dismissed outright, another seven involved only warnings and did not count against his driving record, and the remainder he paid (<EM>see</EM> ex. A).  
He documents to having continuous auto insurance between 1979 (when his policy first issued) and August 2003 (s<EM>ee</EM> ex. B), and to having been awarded a 
good defensive driving certificate in 1978 (<EM>see</EM> ex. C).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With so many citations incurred over a 16-year period, Applicant has learned to be more cautious about his driving, and more attentive about keeping copies of 
his license and insurance with him at all times when he drives.  He has incurred no additional traffic citations since his last citation in March 2000.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant, an Army veteran with an excellent promotion record, is highly regarded by his supervisor and his colleagues at work (<EM>see</EM> ex. F).  His company FSO 
who has known Applicant for 14 years credits him with being very rule conscious at work and trustworthy in protecting classified information.  His 
performance evaluations covering the past year indicate he fully meets his employment objectives (<EM>see</EM> ex. H).  Among his community contributions is a year of 
service as a certified basketball official (<EM>see</EM> ex. E). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) lists policy guidelines to be made by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases. 
These policy guidelines, as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and 
may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance 
should</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these guidelines exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to 
the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E2.2 of 
Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in  reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Basis: conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the 
person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 5: A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating conditions:</STRONG> None</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">      <STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical 
basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of accessible risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof by either showing admitted facts or establishing controverted facts relative to the SOR 
allegations, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his or</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, 
extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a history of traffic-related citations (21 in all) over a 16-year period spanning 1984 and March 2000.  His citations entail equipment violations, 
moving violations, failure to present a valid driver's license, lack of insurance verification, and failure to display a state inspection sticker.  He reports seven of 
the citations being dismissed (mostly after presenting proof of his having a valid license and auto insurance), another seven constituting only warnings which 
were not charged against his driving record, and the remainder being paid.  Applicant attributes his arrests to judgment mistakes that do not reflect the type of 
reliable professional he is credited with being by his supervisors and colleagues at work.</P> 
 
<P>   </P> 
 
<P>Taken together, Applicant's collection of amassed citations over an extended time period have security significance and are covered by one of the disqualifying 
conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal conduct: DC 5 (pattern of dishonesty or rule violations).</P> 
 
<P>Nonetheless, the positive way Applicant has acquitted himself at work and in his community reflects very favorably on his judgment and reliability and  
warrants considerable credit in mitigation.  Not only has he been successful in developing and improving himself professionally with his company, but he has 
been able to make significant military and community contributions as well in recent years (dating to 1989).  His professional and personal development are 
marked by over three  years of trouble-free behavior.  On the strength of his demonstrated successes in his professional and community pursuits, and otherwise 
renewed commitments to complying with the driving laws of his jurisdiction, Applicant mitigates the adverse security implications derived from his numerous 
traffic-related incidents by virtue of his combined showing of increased  attentiveness to safe driving requirements.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect 
to the allegations covered by Guideline E of the SOR.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative 
Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.</SPAN></P>
