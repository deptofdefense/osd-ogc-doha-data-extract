<P>Applicant was in arrears on four debts totaling $20,862.00 raising a financial considerations concern.  Although he has been successful in paying down a 
significant portion of his debt, the recency and amount of debts coupled with his inability to fully explain the status of all debts remains a concern.  Applicant's 
wife is a citizen resident of the Ukraine, raising a foreign influence concern.  He has not presented sufficient evidence to mitigate this concern.  Clearance is 
denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On August 3, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> 
dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge 
to conduct proceedings and determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
<P>In a signed and sworn statement, dated October 21, 2004, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.  On December 22, 2004, 
Applicant withdrew his request for a hearing and requested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.</P> 
<P>On April 7, 2005, Department Counsel submitted the government's case through a file of relevant material (FORM),<A HREF="04-01532.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> a copy of which was provided to the 
Applicant.  He was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant did submit additional 
material, undated, which was forwarded by Department Counsel memorandum dated June 14, 2005.  The case was assigned to me on June 15, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (&para;&para; 1., 1.a. through d., and 2., 2.a.).  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 48-year-old married man.  Since November 2002, he has been employed as a senior logistics coordinator for a defense contractor and is a 
geographical bachelor at a job site on a United States military base in the Middle East.  Since 1994, Applicant has worked for this defense contractor at different 
times at other overseas locations. Applicant seeks a secret security clearance as a job requirement.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In March 2002, Applicant married his current and third wife, who is a Ukrainian citizen.  Their marriage ceremony took place in the Ukraine.  At the time the 
SOR was prepared, Applicant's wife was living in Croatia.  Since then, Applicant's wife has relocated to the Ukraine.  Applicant's wife rents an apartment in 
Kiev and maintains another apartment in Poltava, which she recently inherited when her father passed away.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was married to his first wife from November 1975 to April 1983, and was married to his second wife from July 1987 to October 1996.  Applicant has 
a 16-year-old son, who was born in January 1989.  No further information was developed in the record regarding Applicant's son.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant stated his current spouse "has no business or personal connections with people of foreign power."  Unfortunately, no information was provided as to 
what his spouse does or what her family did for a living or if there were past connections with a foreign government.  Applicant did indicate in his Response to 
FORM that his wife inherited an apartment in Poltava from her father.  In Applicant's Response to SOR, he stated that his wife has been to the United States 
Embassy in Warsaw, Poland seeking an "immigration visa."  The record is void of any further documentation on this subject.  Lastly, there are no facts about 
his connections, if any, with foreign nationals through his spouse.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's Response to SOR offers that he is a loyal American citizen, that he has worked for his employer in various parts of the world, and is "probably 
more at risk of being kidnaped for being an American than [his spouse] is . . . ."  He added that while married to his current wife, he has never lived with her 
more than 13 days.  Such visits have occurred during his rest and relaxation leaves every four months.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The SOR alleges Applicant is in arrears on four debts.  The table below presents details about the debts alleged in the SOR, their current status, and cites to 
relevant parts of the record.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As the above chart reflects, Applicant owed $20,862.00 at the time the SOR was issued in August 2004.  I was unable to determine the status of Debt 4/SOR 
&para;1.d. from the evidence Applicant submitted.  A copy of an unannotated credit report and the absence of monthly statements from individual creditors hampered 
my ability to readily or accurately determine individual accounts status.  No explanation was provided as to how Applicant incurred these debts nor was there 
any evidence of circumstances causing or contributing to the debts.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant stated since November 2002, he has been living overseas and has relied totally on his mother to pay his debts with a joint checking account 
maintained in his and her names.  No further  information was developed regarding his arrangement with his mother regarding the payment of his debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a Letter of Appreciation from the base commander of his Mideast base, which recognized his outstanding performance from July 2003 to 
arch 2004 during Operation Enduring Freedom.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead they are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, administrative judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive.  The government has the burden of proving any 
controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts must have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance 
is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." As 
Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for 
access to classified information to "United States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for 
coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Executive Order 12968, 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines 
contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, then the applicant has the ultimate burden of establishing his security suitability with substantial evidence in 
explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See </EM>Executive Orders 10865 &sect; 2 and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">12968 &sect; 3.1(b). 
"Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." 
Directive &para; E2.2.2 "The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> See Egan</EM>, 
484 U.S. at 531.  Doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had four delinquent debts  (&para;&para; 1.a. through 1.d.).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The Concern:  </EM>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk

the status of Debt 4 based on the evidence submitted.  I am also unable to determine how these debts were incurred or to what extent potential mitigating 
conditions are applicable.  Again viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Applicant, I find the known facts trigger application of Financial

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Guideline B-Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's wife is a citizen of the Ukraine and a resident of Croatia; (&para; 1.a).  A security risk may exist when an Applicant's 
immediate family, or other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to 
duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Government established its case under Guideline B by Applicant's admissions and evidence submitted.  However, since the SOR was issued, Applicant's

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>

to his family members and loyalty to the United States.  MC E2.A2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based on the evidence submitted, I am unable to determine, whether any mitigating conditions under this concern are applicable.  I find against Applicant on 
this concern.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time occurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, as set forth

deficiencies in his Response to SOR noted in Department Counsel's FORM.  I also took into account Applicant is based in the Mideast and made every effort to 
view the facts and evidence in the light most favorable to him.  I can not, however, invent facts and am required to base my decision on the facts presented as
