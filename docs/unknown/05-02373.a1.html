  The Board may not consider new evidence on appeal.  Applicant's statement about her intent are relevant evidence but are not binding on the Judge.  The Judge had to consider Applicant's statements in light of the evidence as a whole.  The Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole.  The favorable evidence  cited by Applicant is insufficient to demonstrate that the Judge's decision was arbitrary and capricious.

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On July 29, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons 
advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 
28, 2006, after the hearing,  Administrative Judge Matthew E. Malone denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.<A HREF="05-02373.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant timely appealed 
pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that the security concerns raised by Applicant's history 
of criminal conduct and alcohol consumption had not been mitigated; and whether the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that Applicant had deliberately 
falsified material facts on her security clearance application and in a statement to a government investigator.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant contends the Administrative Judge should have concluded that the security concerns raised by her criminal conduct and alcohol consumption were 
mitigated.  In support of that contention, Applicant essentially reargues her case with respect to the evidence she presented below and provides additional 
explanations as to the circumstances and dispositions of several of the criminal incidents at issue. Applicant also contends that she did not deliberately falsify 
material facts on her security clearance application and in a statement to a government investigator.  In support of that contention, Applicant argues that the 
omission of material information was due to confusion or forgetfulness.  The Board does not find Applicant's contentions persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Board may not consider new evidence on appeal.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.29.  Accordingly, we may not consider Applicant's additional explanations, and 
they do not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant has not met her burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns presented by her criminal conduct and 
alcohol consumption had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly disagrees with the Judge's conclusions, she has not established that those 
conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.32.3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's statements about her intent and state of mind when she executed her security clearance application, and when she was interviewed by the 
government agent, were relevant evidence, but they were not binding on the Administrative Judge. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-19278 at 6-7 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 
2003). As the trier of fact, the Judge had to consider Applicant's statements in light of the record evidence as a whole, and Applicant's denial of any intent to 
falsify material facts did not preclude the Judge from weighing the record evidence and making findings that contradicted Applicant's denials.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the 
particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance 
decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice versa</EM>.  An applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not 
sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the 
possible application of relevant mitigating factors. The Judge found in Applicant's favor with respect to one of the SOR allegations.  However, the Judge 
reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  
Given the record that was before him, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines J, G, and  E is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary 
to law.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Finally, the favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary 
to law.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  The Board does not review a case </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>de novo</EM>.   Given the record that was before him, 
the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision is sustainable.  Thus, the Administrative Judge did not err in denying Applicant a clearance.</SPAN></P>
