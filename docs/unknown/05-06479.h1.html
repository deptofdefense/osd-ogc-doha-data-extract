<P>Applicant is a 28-year-old site laborer seeking employment with a defense contractor. Over the years, he has accrued 14 delinquent debts. He admits to seven of 
the debts. Of the eight he denies, he has provided no proof and little argument that any obligations are satisfied. Additionally, he has failed to adequately 
explain four of his security clearance application answers involving his financial and employment record. By failing to address these matters, Applicant has 
failed to mitigate security concerns arising from financial considerations and personal conduct. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On October 31, 2005, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) concluding it was unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged 
security concerns under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a notarized statement, dated December 8, 2005, 
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He admitted seven of the 14 allegations raised under Guideline F and admitted two of the four allegations raised 
under Guideline E. Additionally, he waived his right to an administrative hearing in favor of a decision based on the written record. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM),<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> dated January 18, 2006. Applicant received a complete copy of the FORM on January 27, 
2006. He was given the opportunity to submit documentary information in rebuttal, or to explain adverse information in the FORM. In response, Applicant 
substantially repeated his answers to the SOR. On February 2, 2006, Department Counsel personally </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">informed Applicant he could submit additional 
documentation through February 27, 2006.<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant declined to submit any additional material. The case was assigned to an administrative judge on March 
17, 2006, and it was transferred to me on May 24, 2006.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's answers to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 28-year-old site laborer seeking employment with a defense contractor. His employment with this defense contractor is contingent upon his 
eligibility for access to a sensitive assignment abroad. Applicant is unmarried and has earned a high school diploma. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Inasmuch as Applicant failed to provide any documentary evidence or explanation regarding the allegations contained in the SOR, there are no facts setting the 
background as to how the alleged debts arose. Similarly, there is no substantive evidence supporting Applicant's denials regarding some of the alleged debts. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The debts alleged in the SOR are based on the results of a June 28, 2005, Equifax credit report.<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Those debts are set forth below.<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> They are followed by

</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF-86) on June 2, 2005. Based on his answers, four allegations of falsifications have arisen. Applicant 
answered "No" to Question 20 (<STRONG>Your Employment Record</STRONG>: <EM>Has any of the following happened to you in the last 10 years? Fired from a job - Quit a job after 
being told you'd be fired - Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct - Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of 
unsatisfactory performance - Left a job for other reason under unfavorable circumstances</EM>). The Government alleges this is untrue, to which Applicant has 
commented: "Voluntarily left job; either was unfairly treated or not enough hours."<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> To the sub-allegation he was terminated from one position for job 
abandonment, he stated he quit voluntarily. To another sub-allegation, alleging he was terminated from another position for excessive tardiness, he responded 
that he was never late and was always early.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Moreover, Applicant answered "No" to Question 35 (<STRONG>Your Financial Record - Repossessions</STRONG> <EM>In the last 7 years, have you had any property repossessed for 
any reason?</EM>). The Government alleges this is untrue and that he deliberately failed to disclose the automotive repossession noted at SOR sub-paragraph 1.g. In 
his response, Applicant does not deny the allegation. He does, however, elaborate by noting: "Voluntarily repossessed it. I called them."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, concerning Question 38 (<STRONG>Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 Days</STRONG> <EM>In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?</EM>), 
to which Applicant answered "No," the Government asserts that he deliberately failed to list his delinquencies. He responded by stating "I accept that." 
Similarly, with regard to the fourth issue, regarding Question 39 (<STRONG>Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 Days</STRONG> <EM>Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any 
debt(s)?</EM>), and to which Applicant had answered "No," the Government asserts that he also deliberately failed to list these delinquencies. Applicant again 
responded by stating "I accept."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance 
decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with 
the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and 
recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or 
undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will 
continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">him.<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a security 
clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations</SPAN>. <EM>The Concern</EM>:</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct</SPAN>. <EM>The Concern</EM>:</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate 
security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). For clarity, I will discuss each separately.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>Financial Considerations</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government demonstrated that for reasons which remain unexplained, Appellant accrued a number of debts over the past few years.<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> Consequently, 
Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>) apply. With the Government's burden met, the burden should then shift to Applicant to present evidence of refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. Applicant, however, has only provided admissions or denials without any corroborative or 
substantive evidence. Having failed to carry his burden, Applicant has also failed to argue that any of the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>Personal Conduct</EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified material facts on his SF-86 regarding his employment record, repossessions in his financial record, and 
financial delinquencies. Applicant admits to deliberately failing to list his financial delinquencies and he does not deny deliberately failing to disclose that his 
automobile was repossessed.<A HREF="05-06479.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Consequently, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>the deliberate omission, concealment, or 
falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct 
investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness or aware fiduciary 
responsibilities</EM>) applies. Inasmuch as Applicant has admitted three of the four sub-allegations without presenting any evidence of refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation to overcome the case against him, and has presented no supporting evidence with regard to the sole sub-allegation he denies, no Personal Conduct 
itigating Conditions can be applied.</SPAN></P>
