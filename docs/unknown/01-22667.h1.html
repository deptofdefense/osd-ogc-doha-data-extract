<P>Applicant was convicted in 1995 of assault and battery on a girlfriend, and sentenced to two years and two days, two days to serve with balance suspended. In 
January 1996, his sentence was revised to one year in the house of corrections, two days to serve with balance suspended. This judgment, which was affirmed 
on appeal in January 1997, does not fall within the statutory disqualification of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. Criminal conduct concerns persist, as Applicant claims he was 
the victim of a professional confidence artist, dishonest judges, and counsel who sabotaged his own defense. His ongoing denial of any culpability raises serious 
doubts about his reform. There is also an unacceptable risk of undue foreign influence because his daughter is a resident citizen of the Ukraine, who is 
employed as a physician in a regional hospital. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On January 8, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="01-22667.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> DOHA recommended referral to an administrative judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should 
be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The SOR was based on Criminal Conduct (Guideline J), Financial Considerations (Guideline F), and Foreign 
Influence (Guideline B).</P> 
 
<P>On January 26, 2003, Applicant filed his response to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge. The case was assigned 
to me on June 16, 2003. On June 30, 2003, the hearing was scheduled for July 16, 2003. On July 8, 2003, the hearing was cancelled as Applicant was outside of 
the U.S. and not scheduled to return until August 2003. On September 5, 2003, a formal notice was issued rescheduling the hearing for September 24, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>At the hearing, the Government's case consisted of 16 exhibits. Applicant and two coworkers (one present, one former) testified on Applicant's behalf, and he 
submitted eight exhibits, seven of which were accepted. A transcript of the hearing was received on October 3, 2003.  The record was held open for ten days 
following the hearing for Applicant to submit proof of satisfaction of the judgment debt.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>By facsimile on October 1, 2003, Applicant timely forwarded through counsel correspondence from an attorney (Ex. I) and a superior court affidavit (Ex. J) 
showing payment in full of the judgment debt alleged under Guideline F, and an immigrant petition for Applicant's daughter (Ex. K) filed with the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service (INS). On October 6, 2003, Department Counsel objected to the admission of the immigrant petition on the basis the record was held 
open only for proof of judgment payment. Department Counsel indicated she had no objection to proposed exhibits I and J, and since they proved satisfaction of 
the judgment, the Government was no longer pursuing denial of Applicant's clearance under Guideline F. Exhibits I and J were marked and entered into the 
record accordingly. Considering the Directive's requirement to render an overall common sense decision based on all available information, and the relevance 
and materiality of proposed Exhibit K to the Foreign Influence concerns alleged, Exhibit K was marked and admitted as well.<A HREF="01-22667.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>SOR subparagraph 2.a. is considered conceded by the Government based on Department Counsel's representation of October 6, 2003, that the Government was 
no longer seeking to revoke Applicant's clearance under Guideline F. The remaining SOR allegations concern (1) Criminal Conduct (Guideline J) due to an 
April 1986 restraining order issued against him at the request of his spouse; a December 1986 complaint filed by his landlord for violating a protective order 
and assault and battery; a February 1990 complaint filed by a police detective for destruction of property; a February 1994 assault and battery on his then 
girlfriend, for which he was sentenced to two years and two days incarceration (two days served), a sentence alleged to disqualify him from having a security 
clearance granted or renewed under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986;<A HREF="01-22667.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
<P> and a complaint filed by this girlfriend in July 1994 for assault and battery that was nolle prossed; and 
(2) Foreign Influence (Guideline B)  because of his ties to his daughter, a Ukranian resident citizen whom he visits annually and supports financially. In his 
Answer, Applicant admitted being charged criminally as alleged in subparagraphs 1.a., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e. (in part), did not respond to 1.f., which alleges the 
applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, and denied 1.b. and 1.e. (in part). He admitted 3.a., acknowledging his ties to his daughter, a Ukranian resident citizen. After a 
complete and thorough review and consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following  findings:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 56-year-old senior systems development engineer with a defense contractor.  He seeks to retain a secret security clearance. Applicant has a record 
of significant contribution to his employer, but also has a record of criminal involvement, as detailed below.</P> 
 
<P>A native of the Ukraine (then part of Soviet Union), Applicant earned the equivalent of his bachelor and master degrees in physics from a university in the 
Ukraine. From October 1970 to December 1971, Applicant served a year of compulsory military service in the army of the USSR. In March 1971, he married 
his first wife, an ethnic Russian, and that December they had a daughter. Divorced after only two years of marriage, Applicant left the Ukraine for Israel in 
January 1974, where he met a United States (US) native citizen who was performing volunteer work. They decided to wed, and Applicant entered the US in 
September 1974. A few days after his arrival, Applicant on examination began studying for a doctorate at a private university in the US. That November  he and 
his fiancee married. Two children were subsequently born of their union:  a son born in 1976 and a daughter born in 1980.</P> 
 
<P>In March 1979, Applicant became a US naturalized citizen. On earning his Ph. D. degree, Applicant commenced employment in the US defense sector, moving 
his family across the country.  He was granted a secret security clearance for his duties in about May 1983. After his spouse was diagnosed with cancer in 1984, 
Applicant and his family moved back to the East coast where  Applicant gained employment with a university affiliated research company involved in defense 
work. In mid-June 1987, Applicant began working for his present employer as a senior electrical engineer in the development of electro-optical capabilities 
related to surface warfare engineering. </P> 
 
<P>Police were called to Applicant's residence on complaint of disputes involving Applicant and his spouse in April 1986, and Applicant and apparently his tenant 
in November 1996. With respect to both instances, Applicant asserts he was the victim of assaultive behavior. While his spouse obtained a restraining order 
against him, and Applicant was charged with assault and battery on the tenant, the evidence falls short of proving assaultive behavior by Applicant.<A HREF="01-22667.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> A 
complaint was filed against Applicant in February 1990 for alleged destruction of property $250 or less. Applicant indicated another car pulled into a parking 
spot he had planned to enter outside of the hospital where his spouse was being treated for her illness, and claims he did nothing more than ask the other party 
why he had taken his parking spot. Applicant was found not guilty of the charge in court.</P> 
 
<P>Widowed in March 1991, Applicant in late 1991 started dating a woman, an acquaintance of his recently deceased spouse who was a cantor as his spouse had 
been. Their relationship became intimate and in about February 1992, she began cohabitating with Applicant while keeping her own residence. After about 
eighteen months, their relationship had deteriorated to where she moved out in November 1993 and he changed the locks on his residence. She left a 
considerable amount of personal property in his residence. According to Applicant, she gained unauthorized entry to his premises on several occasions 
thereafter and removed several items belonging to him (he was repeatedly "robbed" by a confidence artist). On an occasion in late January 1994, Applicant 
claims he tried to be nice to her, but she stabbed him in the nose without provocation. When he went to call the police, she allegedly ripped the telephone line 
from the wall. Yet they ended up having intimate sexual contact on that occasion. Applicant went to work the next day with a bandage on his nose, telling at 
least one coworker that his former girlfriend had hacked him with some scissors.</P> 
 
<P>In mid-February 1994, Applicant gave this former girlfriend permission to enter his residence to retrieve music she needed for a performance. He served her tea 
and then retired to his bedroom. When she went upstairs to tell him she was leaving, he invited her to watch television and later to join him in bed. He became 
verbally and physically abusive at her refusal to do so. He grabbed her right arm and twisted it around her back, causing a spiral fracture of the mid-shaft right 
humerus, severe sprain and soft tissue damage to her right shoulder. Applicant also kicked her in the legs. She contacted the police, who on arrival observed she 
was holding her right arm and complaining of pain in her lower right leg. Applicant told the police that he physically struggled with his former girlfriend in an 
effort to remove her from his premises, and that she injured her arm in the struggle. Applicant's former girlfriend was transported to the hospital where she was 
treated for a displaced spiral fracture of the right arm. Applicant was arrested for assault and battery.<A HREF="01-22667.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant waived a jury trial and in June 1994 was found guilty of assault and battery. He was sentenced to one year in the house of correction, suspended, and 
placed on probation, and  ordered to be evaluated in a violent offender's program, and to stay away from the victim. In July 1994, Applicant came home to find 
his former girlfriend on the premises. He called the police, who allowed her to remove some of her possessions. Applicant maintains she took items of his as 
well, although he provided no proof for his claim. He filed charges against her for breaking and entering and obtained a restraining order against her. In October 
1994, his former girlfriend filed a complaint against him for assault and battery on that date in July. Applicant pleaded not guilty and the charge was nolle 
prossed.</P> 
 
<P>Ordered to attend violence control counseling, Applicant faced jail time if he did not finish the program. Applicant attended one or two sessions before he was 
kicked out for refusal to admit to abusive conduct. Applicant was allowed to pursue individual counseling with a local therapist. Circa May 1995, he completed 
his counseling sessions. In January 1995, he filed a motion for a new trial.</P> 
 
<P>In April 1995, Applicant's June 1994 assault and battery conviction was vacated and he was granted a new trial. Applicant maintains that before his new trial, 
his former girlfriend entered his residence without his permission in July 1995 and removed some of his property, including his building badge for work. He 
presented no documentation in support of his claim.</P> 
 
<P>In mid-October 1995, Applicant was convicted by a jury of assault and battery on his former girlfriend in February 1994. He was sentenced by the presiding 
judge to two years and two days in the house of correction, two days to be served, and deemed served, balance suspended in October 1997, $700 restitution 
(suspended) and $50 costs (suspended). In January 1996, on Applicant's motion to revise and revoke, the judge revised Applicant's sentence to one year in the 
house of correction, two days to serve, balance suspended in October 1997. In early January 1997, the judgment was affirmed on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>Up to and including December 1994, three different doctors diagnosed Applicant's former girlfriend as suffering from frozen shoulder and/or adhesive 
capsulitis (<EM>i.e., </EM>shoulder joint with very limited passive range of motion) as a result of the fracture of her right arm by Applicant. Under treatment for her 
physical injuries as well as emotional distress since 1994, Applicant's former girlfriend filed a civil suit against him. In February 2000, after a hearing, a state 
district court judge determined, in part, Applicant had behaved erratically in permitting his former girlfriend access to his home to recover her belongings; he 
granted his former girlfriend permission to enter his home to recover her music on the occasion in February 1994; Applicant served her tea and invited her to 
join him in bed; he became physically abusive at her refusal and caused a spiral fracture of the mid-shaft of her right humerus (arm), contusions to her right 
tibia, foot and knee, and severe sprain and tissue damage to her right shoulder, arm, and hand; and Applicant was convicted of assault and battery, affirmed on 
appeal. Based on medical reports and physician testimony, the judge further found Applicant's girlfriend sustained permanent physical and emotional injuries, 
the assault having exacerbated a pre-existing borderline personality disorder and caused symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. The judge found 
Applicant's conduct (twisting his former girlfriend's arm behind his back, kicking her) in February 1994 was intentional and involved a high degree of 
likelihood that substantial harm would result, and that he interfered with her efforts to recover her property. In March 2000, a civil judgment was entered 
against Applicant in the amount of $253,253.50 ($150,000 in damages plus $103,140 prejudgment interest and $113.50 costs). Applicant paid off the judgment 
in December 2002. There is no evidence Applicant has had any contact with this former girlfriend, other than court proceedings, since 1995.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant did not allow his legal difficulties to negatively impact his work performance. An expert in electro-optics, Applicant in April 2002 was awarded a 
patent involving a cooling apparatus. He has made valuable contributions to a surface radar engineering project. Coworkers familiar with Applicant's work 
describe him as a technically very competent individual who exhibits calm, level-headed demeanor on the job.</P> 
 
<P>In conjunction with his present employment, Applicant executed a security clearance application on July 10, 1998. Applicant disclosed the Ukrainian residency 
and citizenship of his first wife and daughter from that marriage, and listed repeated travel (at least annually since July 1991) to the Ukraine to see his daughter. 
With regard to his police record, Applicant listed his conviction for the February 1994 assault and battery, but claimed he had been the victim of a former 
girlfriend, "a professional confidence artist and a violent sociopath" who he indicated attacked him while he was asleep. He contended three district court 
judges (one he described as a "violent sociopath") conspired with his former girlfriend to lie to the jury and rob him.</P> 
 
<P>During an interview with a special agent of the Defense Security Service on June 11, 2001, Applicant discussed his foreign ties. Applicant related his first wife 
and his daughter by that marriage are resident citizens of the Ukraine; that his former spouse worked as a nurse in a rehabilitation facility while his daughter 
was a medical doctor on staff of a hospital. Applicant explained his travel to the Ukraine annually from 1991 to March 1999 to visit his daughter, for whom he 
provides financial support of $3,000 annually. Applicant denied any contact with his daughter since his last visit in March 1999, when it was revealed that he 
had been dating a married woman (educated as a chemical engineer in Russia) who had emigrated from Russia to the US without her spouse. Applicant added 
that this woman had since divorced and become a US naturalized citizen. Applicant denied he had ever been approached or improperly contacted on his trips to 
the Ukraine. He indicated he would immediately report any suspicious contacts to company security officials and/or appropriate US government authorities.</P> 
 
<P>Interviewed also about his criminal record and his relationship with his former girlfriend, Applicant admitted an intimate relationship with her until June 1993. 
Applicant then detailed a history of her unauthorized entry into his home, although he told the agent that after she stabbed him in the nose in late January 1994, 
they ended up having sexual relations. On the day of his arrest for assault and battery in February 1994, Applicant let her in his residence so she could retrieve 
her music. Applicant claims he fell asleep while standing in the hallway waiting for her to leave, and she attacked him. Applicant denied that he twisted her arm 
around her back or that he hit or beat her up in any way. Applicant expressed his belief that she came to the home with a broken arm. In acknowledging his 
conviction following a jury trial, Applicant claimed the jury suggested no punishment due to his former girlfriend's contributing behavior, but that the judge 
gave him a two year suspended sentence. Faced with a civil suit related to these "same false charges," Applicant submits a report of her treatment confirmed 
"the broken arm story was a lie." Concerning the restraining order obtained by his second wife against him in the mid-1980s, Applicant asserted any claims of 
abusive behavior on his part were false and due to his spouse's cancer. Of his dispute with his tenant in the mid-1980s, Applicant maintained he was attacked 
by his tenant.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant continues to believe he was the victim of a confidence artist as well as corrupt  judges and legal counsel who "robbed" him at trial. He testified in 
September 2003 that his former girlfriend already had a broken arm when she came to his home to retrieve her music in February 1994.</P> 
 
<P>Having reestablished contact with his daughter in the Ukraine, Applicant filed a petition with the US Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in 
December 2002 for her to immigrate to the US. He visited his daughter in the Ukraine in July 2003. They correspond via electronic mail about six or seven 
times per year. Applicant is on good terms with his first wife in the Ukraine. He contacts her by electronic mail three or four times per year to discuss matters 
related to their daughter.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States 
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, 
discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations 
governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information." Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for 
a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability. <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</P> 
 
<P>Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15. An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</P> 
 
<P>Considering the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Criminal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P>

<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
 
<P>a. Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</P> 
 
<P>b. A single, serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</P>

<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries 
are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in,

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to Guidelines J and B:<A HREF="01-22667.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The Government alleged several instances of criminal conduct by Applicant, but presented sufficient proof only of the February 1994 assault and battery of his 
former girlfriend. Although a restraining order was apparently issued against Applicant in April 1986, the basis for the order is not of record and Applicant 
denies any misconduct. In addition to the confusion over the identities of the landlord and tenant, the police report documenting the November 1986 landlord-tenant dispute contains nothing more than complaints of assault by both parties. A dismissal of the charges with prejudice in court falls far short of meeting the 
Government's burden of proving an assault that Applicant denies. Applicant was found not guilty in court of the destruction of property charge filed against him 
in 1990. Concerning the July 1994 incident involving his former girlfriend, there is sufficient basis to find she was trespassing. The police record indicates 
Applicant locked her between some doors while he waiting for the police to arrive, but a charge of assault filed against him was nolle prossed. Favorable 
findings are returned as to SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., and 1.e.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant also denies culpability in the February 1994 assault and battery of his former girlfriend, but he was convicted following a jury trial in October 1995, 
and that judgment of conviction was affirmed on appeal in January 1997. Applicant is collaterally estopped from challenging his conviction.<A HREF="01-22667.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Several judges 
and a jury reviewed the facts and determined Applicant was guilty of the crime charged. As recently as February 2000, a district court judge reviewing a related 
civil claim for damages concluded that Applicant intentionally twisted his former girlfriend's arm behind her back and kicked her at the same time. Criminal 
activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  (<EM>See</EM> under Guideline J, disqualifying conditions (DC) a. allegations or 
admission of criminal conduct, and b. a single serious crime).</P> 
 
<P>The Government's case for the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 (P.L. 106-398),<A HREF="01-22667.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and hence DC c. (Conviction in a Federal or State court, including courts 
marital, and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year) is based on the fact that Applicant was sentenced in October 1995 for the assault and 
battery to a prison term of two years and two days (two days to be served with balance suspended October 1997). Under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, a person who has 
been convicted in a Federal or State court, including a courts-martial, may not be granted access or have renewed access to classified information absent the 
grant of a waiver by the Secretary of Defense or Secretary of the Military Department. With the statutory disqualification based on the sentence imposed rather 
than on the amount of time actually served, a sentence of two years would fall within 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  However, while Applicant was awaiting a decision on 
appeal of his conviction, the sentence was revised by the trial judge in January 1996 to one year in the house of correction, two days to serve, balance suspended 
October 1997, a sentence that does not fall within the federal statute.  Presented is the issue of whether this revised sentence controls for purposes of 
determining the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 to the facts of this case.</P> 
 
<P>The DOHA Appeal Board, relying on the Federal Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the U.S. Constitution, has consistently maintained that post conviction 
state remedies, such as pardons or expungements, do not nullify the prohibition set forth under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. Subsequent state action that sets aside a 
conviction or dismisses the prosecution, even if the dismissal has the same effect as an acquittal, do not negate a conviction for purposes of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. 
(<EM>See</EM> ISCR 01-00407 decided September 18, 2002). There is no dispute that Applicant was sentenced in October 1995 to a term of imprisonment of two years 
and two days, with all but two days suspended. Rule 29(a) of the pertinent state rules of criminal procedure provides for revision or revocation of a criminal 
sentence by the trial judge:</P> 
 
<P>(a) Revision or Revocation. The trial judge upon his motion or the written motion of a defendant filed within sixty days after the imposition of a sentence, 
within sixty days after receipt by the trial court of a rescript issued upon affirmance of the judgment or dismissal of the appeal, or within sixty days after entry of 
any order or judgment or an appellate court denying review of, or having the effect of upholding a judgment of conviction, may, upon such terms and conditions 
as he shall order, revise or revoke such sentence <STRONG>if it appears that justice may not have been done</STRONG> (emphasis added).</P> 
 
<P>The state's highest court has made it clear that the purpose of Rule 29(a) is to permit the trial judge to reconsider the sentence he or she imposed and determine, 
in light of the facts as they existed at the time of sentencing, whether the sentence was just.<A HREF="01-22667.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> The record is silent as to the grounds on which Applicant filed a 
motion to revise or revoke and the judge's reasons why he allowed it. There is no indication that the state opposed Applicant's request to revoke, or that the 
appellate court reinstated the original sentence. Based on DOHA Appeal Board precedent, a revocation and revision of sentence after an appellate court's ruling 
denying review or having the effect of upholding a judgment on conviction would not negate the federal disqualification under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  However, in 
this case the original sentence was revoked and revised by the trial judge before the decision of the appellate court, so the judgment affirmed by the state 
appellate court is considered to be the conviction and the sentence as revised. To apply the statutory disqualification under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 based on a sentence 
that was revoked and revised pending appeal would deny a criminal defendant his right to appeal legal error, an untenable result. For 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 to apply, 
there must be not only a conviction, but also a qualifying sentence of imprisonment of more than one year. 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 is found not to apply. Accordingly, 
subparagraph 1.f. is resolved in Applicant's favor.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's criminal assault of his former girlfriend in 1994 is not recent, and the Government failed to meet its burden to prove the other allegations of 
misconduct. While the Directive provides for mitigation where the criminal conduct is not recent (MC a.) and is isolated (MC b.), other variables must be 
considered, such as the seriousness of the conduct (<EM>see</EM> E2.2.1.1.), the presence or absence of rehabilitation (<EM>see</EM> E2.2.1.6), and the voluntary nature of the 
conduct (<EM>see</EM> E2.2.1.2.). Applicant intentionally inflicted injury to his former girlfriend in knowing and reckless disregard of the consequences. Reform of such 
serious criminal conduct requires an acknowledgment of wrongdoing that is not present in this case. Despite strong evidence of his culpability, Applicant 
continues to portray himself as a victim of a "continuous criminal conspiracy." Applicant claims that his former girlfriend came to his home with her arm 
already broken. The police and hospital records confirm she was in a significant amount of pain from the broken arm. It is not credible that she would have set 
the table, jumped in bed with him, and then attacked him in the hallway while he was asleep if she already had the spiral fracture and damage to her shoulder.  
Applicant's vitriol toward the judicial system, as evidenced by him calling one judge a "violent sociopath," and his lack of candor with the Department of 
Defense about his role in the events of February 1994, raise considerable doubt as to whether Applicant possesses the requisite good judgment to retain his 
security clearance. Applicant's significant contributions to his employer are viewed favorably, but they are not enough to overcome the Guideline J concerns. 
SOR subparagraph 1.d. is resolved against him.</P> 
 
<P>Concerning Guideline B, Foreign Influence, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom 
he is bound by affection, influence or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. Applicant admits he is attached to his 
daughter, a Ukranian citizen who is a physician at a regional hospital there. He traveled to see her annually from 1991 to March 1999, until they had a falling 
out caused by him dating a married woman who had emigrated from Russia to the US without her spouse. In Spring 2001, Applicant wrote to his first wife in an 
effort to reestablish his relationship with his daughter. Apparently he was successful, as he petitioned for his daughter's immigration to the US in December 
2002, and visited her in the Ukraine in 2003. In addition to his in-person contacts, he corresponds by electronic mail with his daughter six or seven times per 
year and sends her about $3,000 in financial assistance annually. Moreover, although not alleged by the Government, Applicant is on good terms with his first 
wife in the Ukraine. In determining Applicant's security suitability, consideration is therefore warranted of disqualifying condition E2.A2.1.2.1., an immediate 
family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country.</P> 
 
<P>The security concerns raised by the foreign citizenship and residency of close family members may be mitigated where it can be determined that they are not 
agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force him to choose between loyalty to them and the United 
States (<EM>see</EM> E2.A2.1.3.1.). There is no evidence Applicant's daughter--or his first wife--is an agent of a foreign power. However, Applicant has the burden of 
demonstrating that these foreign nationals are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power. As articulated by the DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR 00-0317, 
decided on March 29, 2002:</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline B, the presence of family members in a foreign country must be evaluated both in terms of (i) possible vulnerability to coercive pressure or 
influence being brought to bear on, or through an applicant's family members in a foreign country, and (ii) possible vulnerability to noncoercive means of 
influence being brought to bear on, or through, an applicant's family members in a foreign country.</P> 
 
<P>Little is known of Applicant's daughter's associates or activities in the Ukraine. As a practicing physician, his daughter may well enjoy some visibility as well 
as position of stature in her community. While Applicant recently filed an application for her immigration to the United States, there exists an unacceptable risk 
of undue foreign influence as long as she remains subject to Ukranian laws and within the physical reach of foreign authorities. While Applicant is on good 
terms with his first spouse, Applicant does not feel the same affection for the woman to whom he was married for only two years in the 1970s. The Ukrainian 
residence and citizenship of his ex-wife are  relevant because of the influence she may have on their daughter.  Applicant testified his ex-wife now distributes 
trade literature, but the record contains scant information about her personal and work life. SOR subparagraph 3.a. is resolved against him, as Applicant has not 
met his burden of demonstrating that his daughter is not vulnerable to foreign influence.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>It is not clear why Applicant's spouse requested the restraining order in April 1986. Concerning the November 1986 landlord-tenant dispute, Applicant is 
identified in the police record as the tenant. Yet, in its narrative report, the police list the name of the complainant as the person who not only claims he was 
attacked by the tenant, but also as the person who allegedly attacked the landlord. The SF 86 and court records indicate Applicant resided at the address until 
1996, which lends some credence to his claim that he was the landlord, although it does not compel that conclusion. Court documents pertinent to the incident 
indicate criminal charges were filed against Applicant in December 1986 for assault and battery and violation of restraining order by the complainant, but the 
charges were dismissed with prejudice. The existence of a restraining order against Applicant is some indication of a volatile relationship between the two 
parties, but the Government did not prove the assault alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.b., which Applicant denies.
