<P>Applicant has a history of delinquent debts that he has failed to address, but instead relied on the expiration of the lawful period for credit reporting delinquent 
and charged off debts.  Reliance on the absence of any enforcement authority due to the passage of time is insufficient to represent the kind of good-faith 
repayment efforts necessary to mitigate his financial problems.  Security concerns over his financial history are compounded by his falsification of his security 
clearance application (SF-86), which he failed to mitigate by any prompt, good-faith correction in his ensuing DSS interview.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 27, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on September 25, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on November 17, 2003, and was scheduled for 
hearing on December 17, 2003.  A hearing was convened on December 17, 2003, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of three exhibits; Applicant 
relied on two witnesses (including himself) and no exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on December 29, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have nine delinquent debts, which exceed $17,000.00 in total.  Under Guideline E, he is alleged to have falsified his 
SF-86 of June 14, 2001, by omitting his debts covered by subparagraphs 2.a, 2.c, 2.d, 2.f, 2.h, 2.i, and 2.j of the SOR, when responding to question 39  of his 
SF-86.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations.  He claimed the listed bad debts were acquired by  both himself and his ex-wife; 
although, he was not aware of some of the accounts.  Applicant claimed he closed the accounts while he was waiting for the 7-year grace period to elapse.  He 
claimed he has acquired no major debt, has kept his current bills paid, and has learned his lesson.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF FACTS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 43-year-old electrical installer for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by 
Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant enlisted in the Navy in 1978 and served honorably for 20 years before retiring in November 1998 as a petty officer first class with 20 years of active 
service (<EM>see</EM> ex. 1).  While in the Navy, Applicant and his wife (W1) incurred a number of consumer debts, which Applicant encountered difficulty in repaying.  
As his marriage began to deteriorate, W1 went on disability and quit her job.  However, she continued to shop and accrue debts.  With their limited income, and 
W1's unwillingness to join him on reassignment to another state, Applicant separated from W1 and divorced her in February 1998.  As a part of their 
separation, W was awarded their automobile.  When he relocated, he made not effort to notify his creditors of his new address and never received any further 
billings from them.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Other than the  new  home and truck he has financed with his new wife (W2), Applicant has incurred no new major debts and is current on his other accounts.  
In addition to a $2,500.00 savings account, he has a 401(k) retirement account worth around $25,000.00.     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With the exception of the delinquent debt covered by creditor 1.e, Applicant admits all of the listed debts are debts he incurred during his marriage to W1 and 
remains legally responsible for.  The creditor 1.e debt is reflected on his creditor's report (ex. 3) as a credit card account opened in November 1998, seven 
months after his divorce was finalized, and an account that was not opened by himself (R.T., at 30-31).  He acknowledges another credit card account with the 
same creditor that is also reflected in his credit report (also shown as a charged off debt with a balance of $5,031.00).  This second account is reported as an 
account opened in 1993.  Applicant's claims that this covered debt in the SOR is not the one he opened is accepted.  In its place as a delinquent debt for which 
he acknowledges responsibility is the reported charged off debt with the same creditor in the amount of $5,031.00 (ex. 2; R.T., at 31-32).  While this is 
technically a different debt it is a delinquent debt with the same creditor and may be substituted under the SOR without a formal leave to amend.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In the past, Applicant has indicated no intent to pay off his old charged off debts (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2).  While he expressed some uncertainty about some of the charged 
off debts attributable to him, he admitted responsibility for all of them in his March 2002 DSS statement after being showed his credit report (ex. 2).  He admits 
to making no attempt to pay any of his charged off debts, or to let his creditors know of his relocation.  Impressed that once the creditor charges off a debt, the 
debt is extinguished, he was content simply with letting the 7-year period on reporting charged off debts in his credit report expire without any action on his 
part.  While both he and W2 assure at hearing he was mistaken about his understanding of his debts and will now try to work out repayment arrangements with 
his charged off creditors, they provide no convincing reasons why Applicant  has changed his mind (R.T., at 35, 41, 56-57, 73).  Based on his actions and 
statements to date about his old debts, he has shown too little prior interest in addressing his old debts to warrant inferences he will undertake future repayment 
actions on these accounts in the foreseeable future.  Not only has he avoided any direct contact with his creditors, but he has failed to date to enlist any credit 
counseling service to aid him in working out  repayment arrangements, either individually, or through a debt consolidation program.</P> 
 
<P>Asked to complete an SF-86 in June 2001, Applicant answered in the negative to having any debts currently over 90 days delinquent.  He attributes his 
misstatement to his belief that the question was not asking about charged off debts, only current debts over 90 days delinquent.  Applicant acknowledges, 
though, he made no attempt to secure his credit report before completing his SF-86.  Applicant answered in the negative when responding to question 34 of his 
SF-86 (inquiring about wage garnishments).  While Applicant admits to a wage garnishment, he is certain no garnishment actions were taken before July 2001 
(R.T., at 52-53).  Without any evidence of pre-July 2001 garnishment actions, no adverse inference can be drawn here of any deliberate omission of 
garnishments covered by question 34.  However, Applicant's explanations for omitting his charged off debts when responding to question 39 of his SF-86 
cannot be accepted as a good-faith mistake based on his own knowledge and understanding of his debts and the question in his SF-86 that asked about them.  
Inferences warrant, accordingly, that Applicant's omissions of his listed debt delinquencies were made knowingly and wilfully.</P> 
 
<P> Applicant did not come forward to disclose his delinquent debts until confronted with the same by the interviewing DSS agent in an interview conducted in 
arch 2002.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often linked to 
proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (<EM>e.g., </EM>loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P>

</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate

<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance 
and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from 
the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant accrued considerable debt, much of it consumer-related, while in the Navy. Unable to stay up with his accrued debts with his limited work following 
his first wife's quitting her job and going on disability, he was content to let his debts become delinquent.   To date, he has never made any tangible efforts to 
pursue repayment arrangements, either collectively through debt consolidation organizations, or individually that he can document. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Altogether, Applicant and his former wife accrued over $17,000.00 in delinquent debt, much of it  covered by  defaulted credit cards and consumer loans.  Most 
of these listed debts were charged off by Applicant's respective creditors holding these accounts.  Applicant has not to date shown any probative commitment to 
addressing any of these debts, preferring instead to let the 7-year grace periods on credit company reporting of debts run their course and rely on his mistaken 
assumption his charged off debts were no longer viable debts he need be concerned about.  On the strength of the evidence presented, Government may invoke 
two Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations: DC 1 (history of not meeting financial obligations) and DC 3 
(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).</P> 
 
<P>While some of Applicant's debt delinquencies are attributable to his loss of his first wife's income amidst extenuating circumstances (as a result of her 
disability and subsequent job termination and spousal separation), his explanations for failing to later tend to these debts when financially able are not.  Making 
no tangible attempts to work out repayment arrangements with his creditors and relying instead on letting the 7-year grace period for credit reporting expire 
does not constitute good-faith efforts to pay or otherwise resolve his debt charge offs.  Nor do undocumented promises to address old debts in the future 
represent tangible good-faith attempts to take care of an applicant's delinquent debts.</P> 
 
<P>Over time, our Appeal Board has shown general consistency in disallowing undocumented general applicant intention to repay old debts at some uncertain 
future date when resources become available.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 01-17474 (March 7, 2003); ISCR Case No. 01-13653 (March 7, 2003); ISCR Case No. 01-12147 (January 21, 2003).   So, too, an applicant's reliance on the expiration of covered periods of credit reporting and statutes of limitation does not represent 
the kind of good-faith repayment efforts contemplated by MC 6 (initiated good-faith efforts to repay overdue creditors).  In ISCR Case No. 02-32606 (January 
21, 2004), our Appeal Board distinguished good-faith efforts to repay overdue creditors (the MC 6 standard) from situations where an applicant avoids paying 
his debts until they are uncollectible because the statute of limitations has run.  Noting  that reliance on a statute of limitation (or in Applicant's case his waiting 
for the 7-year period of reporting bad debts to expire) would be a legally permissible course of action to avert collection actions, the Appeal Board squarely held 
that such a course of action would not satisfy the good-faith repayment criterion of MC 6.   The situation is no different in Applicant's case.  His reliance on the 
absence of any collection enforcement action to date by his creditors, while perhaps an effective way to clear his credit report of these charged off accounts, is 
insufficient to demonstrate any good-faith efforts to resolve his debts.</P> 
 
<P>Security clearance decisions are, of course, never an exact science, but rather involve predictive judgments about a person's security eligibility based on the 
evidence presented.  Without any payment documentation of repayment efforts, Applicant lacks the probative mitigation necessary to absolve him of the 
pressure and judgment risks associated with being in debt.  <EM>See Department of Navy v. Egan, </EM>484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).  So, while Applicant may take 
advantage of MC 3 (conditions largely beyond the person's control) of the Adjudicative Guidelines to extenuate some of his debt delinquencies, he may not  
invoke the mitigating provisions of MC 6 (initiated good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors), absent more concerted efforts to address his old creditors to 
date.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant, accordingly, with respect to subparagraphs 2.a through 2.i of the Adjudicative Guidelines governing financial 
considerations.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Posing security concerns, too, are Applicant's falsification of his March 2001 SF-86  by omitting his listed delinquent debts when responding to question 39.  
Found to have knowingly and wilfully omitted his debts, his falsification conduct falls under DC 2 (The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of 
relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire</SPAN>) of the Guideline for personal conduct.  Not until he was confronted with his debts by an 
interviewing DSS agent almost nine months later did he correct his omissions.  His correction do not, as such, reflect prompt, good-faith corrections of his 
previous omissions in accordance with the standards framed by our Appeal Board and  do not permit him to mitigate his deliberate omissions under the facts 
developed here.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraph 1.a of the allegations governing personal conduct.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative 
Guidelines of the Directive.</SPAN></P>
