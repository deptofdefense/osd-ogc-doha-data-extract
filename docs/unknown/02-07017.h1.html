<P>The Applicant has renounced his Canadian citizenship.  He has a Canadian old age pension plan worth about $24,000, and a Canadian bank account worth only 
about $1,200.  These Canadian financial interests are not significant when compared to his net worth in the U.S. of more than $345,000.  His wife and two 
minor children are Canadian citizens, but live with the Applicant in the U.S.  His wife is a homemaker, and his 11 and 13 year old sons are members of the Boy 
Scouts of America.  The Applicant is a Scout Master.  His 70 year old Canadian mother is also a homemaker.  The Applicant has three siblings.  One is a dual 
national living and working in the U.S.  The other two are dual nationals living in Canada, one is an aerobics instructor, and the other is a grocery clerk.  He has 
little contact with his step-siblings.  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 6, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on March 26, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on May 27, 2003.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 25, 2003, and the case was heard on July 10, 2003.  The 
Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary evidence.  The transcript was 
received on July 21, 2003.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's alleged foreign preference and perceived foreign influence militate against the 
granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis for all of the allegations.]</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">40 years of age, has a 
Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering, and is employed by a defense contractor that seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant</SPAN>.  After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline C - Foreign Preference</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>1.a.~1.c., and 2.g.  The Applicant was born in the U.S. to Canadian nationals (Transcript (TR) at page 24 lines 7~21).  Two years later, his parents divorced, 
with his mother taking their children to Canada (<EM>id</EM>).  The Applicant was educated, married, worked and lived in Canada as a dual national until 1997 (TR at 
page 24 line 22 to page 25 line 18, and Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at page 3).  He moved to California five years ago where he works for his present employer 
(TR at page 24 line 22 to page 25 line 18).  While working in Canada he accrued an old age pension worth about $24,000 (TR at page 16 line 13 to page 17 line 
3, at page 20 line 17 to page 21 line 25, and Applicant's Exhibit (AppX) A at page 5).  This pension will not be available for another 25 years TR at page 16 
line 13 to page 17 line 3, at page 20 line 17 to page 21 line 25, and AppX B at pages 1 and 12).  His net worth in the U.S. is as follows: $200,000 of equity in 
his house, more than $85,000 in a money market fund, and more than $60,000 in his employer's stock (TR at page 22 lines 1~20, at page 33 line 14 to page 34 
line 3, and AppX A at pages 6~7).  He has voted in local Canadian elections, but now is registered to vote in the U.S. (TR at page 17 lines 3~15, at page 26 line 
20 to page 27 line 3, and AppX A at page 2).  Last month, the Applicant formally renounced his Canadian citizenship by filing the appropriate paperwork with 
the nearest Canadian Consulate (AppX at pages 1~6).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>2.a.~2.f, and 2.h.  The Applicant's wife and two minor sons are Canadian citizens (TR at page 18 line 15 to page 19 line 13, and at page 27 line 4 to page 28 
line 17).  His wife is a homemaker (<EM>id</EM>).  He is seeking U.S. citizenship for his two sons, who are members of the Boys Scouts of <STRONG>America</STRONG>, and the Applicant is 
their Scout Master (<EM>ibid</EM>).  His 70 year old Canadian mother is also a homemaker (TR at page 28 line 18 to page 29 line 2, and at page 37 lines 11~13).  He has 
three dual nation siblings, two of which live in Canada, and the other in the U.S. (TR at page 29 lines 3~13, and at page 37 line 21 to page 38 line 4).  One of 
his Canadian siblings is an aerobics instructor, and the other is a grocery clerk (<EM>id</EM>).  He has little, if any, contact with his Canadian step-siblings (TR at page 29 
lines 14~18, and at page 29 line 24 to page 30 line 7).  His Canadian parents-in-law are retired school teachers (TR at page 29 lines 8~17).  None of the 
Applicant's Canadian relatives have any connection with the Canadian Government, or are in a position to be coerced by any foreign government (TR at page 
18 lines 8~14).  The Applicant also has about $1,200 in a Canadian bank account (TR at page 19 line 25 to page 20 line 16, and AppX A at page 4).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN> should be followed in every case <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Preference</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  The exercise of dual citizenship;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  Accepting educational . . . or other benefits, such as retirement . . . from a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">8.  Voting in foreign elections.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  An immediate family member . . . is a citizen of . . . a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">8.  A substantial financial interest in a country . . . that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), . . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">5.  Foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference), and Guideline B (foreign influence), which establishes doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct 
evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates a foreign preference, or who is subject to a foreign influence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are 
harmful to the interests of the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all 
security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has formally renounced his Canadian citizenship.  I therefore conclude that the Applicant has not only met but has clearly surpassed the 
requirement of the last mitigating condition under Guideline C, which merely requires that he "express a willingness to renounce dual citizenship."  He is not 
now a dual national, but only a U.S. citizen.  Although he has voted in local Canadian elections, he will not do so again as he is no longer a Canadian citizen.  
He is now only a registered U.S. voter.  Guideline C is therefore found in his favor.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's Canadian mother, and two dual national siblings, reside in Canada.  His 70 year old mother is a homemaker, and his siblings are an aerobics 
instructor and a grocery clerk.  His parent-in-laws are retired school teachers.  None of his Canadian relatives have any connection with any government, and 
there is no evidence that their presence in Canada can be exploited by any government.  In addition, I conclude that it would be unlikely that the Applicant 
would even consider any such attempt at exploitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to his current financial interests in Canada.  His $24, 000 old age pension will not mature for another 25 years, and his $1,200 in a Canadian bank pales in 
comparison with his $345,000 U.S. net worth.  Guideline B is also found in the Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his alleged foreign preference, and foreign influence.  The Applicant 
has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines B and C, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion 
under Guidelines B and C.</SPAN></P>
