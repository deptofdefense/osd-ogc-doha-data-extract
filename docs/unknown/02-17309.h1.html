<P>Applicant has a history of alcohol-related incidents over a 25-year period and continues to consume alcohol at abusive levels.  Applicant's concealment of most 
of his alcohol-related arrests in his 2001 security clearance application (SF-86) raises additional security concerns about Applicant's judgment and reliability.   
So, despite a meritorious employment record and avoidance of any additional alcohol-related incidents or judgment lapses, Applicant fails to mitigate the 
government's security concerns.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">          On July 22, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance, and recommended referral 
to an administrative judge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on August 19, 2003, and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant was furnished the File 
of Relevant Material (FORM) on December 1, 2003 and received it on December 24, 2003.  Applicant filed a timely response to the FORM on January 18, 
2004.  The case was assigned to me February 2, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline G, Applicant is alleged to have (a) been involved in seven alcohol-related incidents between 1978 and 1995, only two of which resulted in a 
conviction for the offense charged, (b) consumed alcohol, beginning at age 17, and continuing over the next 15 to 20 years in increasing amounts, often to the 
point of intoxication, and (c) continues to drink.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his security clearance application (SF-86) of September 2001 by omitting all but one (his 1984 DuI 
offense) of his alcohol-related offenses, despite his listing several of these offenses in a 1991 SF-86.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant </SPAN>admitted all of his alcohol-related offenses, but denied falsifying his SF-86.  Applicant claimed to believe he attached a 
separate list of his alcohol-related offenses to his September 2001 SF-86.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 33-year old aircraft dispatcher for a defense contractor who seeks to retain the security clearance he has held since 1991.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered 
in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Beginning in 1977, Applicant began consuming beer on the weekends.  He was 17 at the time and typically would consume 2 to 3 beers on weekend nights (<EM>see 
</EM>ex. 6).  He gradually increased hi alcohol consumption over the ensuing four years until he reached majority.  Between 1981 and 1987, he increased both the 
frequency and amount of alcohol he consumed: consuming a 12-pack on the weekends during his days off.  At the height of his drinking frequency (in 1989), he 
would typically consume 3 to 4 beers on 2 to 3 occasions after work during a typical week.  He drank to relieve the stress he was under, which he attributes to 
his spouse, an alcoholic he couldn't control. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After reducing his alcohol consumption for several years in the late 80s, Applicant returned to excessive consumption during the period spanning 1986 and 
1990.  He attributes his increased drinking to his spouse's medical problems.  Never feeling he was addicted to alcohol, he seldom drank more than 4 beers at a 
time, mostly in social situations with co-workers after work, during this five-year stretch.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's alcohol-related problems with law enforcement trace to the 1970s  and 80s when he was arrested several times for alcohol-related incidents.  His 
first such arrest occurred in 1978 when he was charged with </SPAN>DuI.   He later pleaded guilty to a reduced reckless driving charge and  was fined and taxed court 
costs.  Applicant's admitted drinking prior to his arrest qualifies this offense as an alcohol-related incident, irrespective of the state's withdrawal of the more 
serious DuI charge.  In May 1984, Applicant was arrested again for an alcohol-related offense: violation of the state's open container law, to which he pleaded 
guilty and was fined $35.00 plus court costs.  Applicant was arrested for a third alcohol-related offense in July 1984 and charged with DuI.  He pleaded guilty to 
the charge and was fined $250.00 by the court and ordered to attend 16 hours of alcohol counseling.  </P> 
 
<P>In approximately November 1985, Applicant was cited for speeding, for which he was fined and paid a $300.00 fine.  Following a brief respite from abusive 
drinking, Applicant returned to abusive drinking (between 1986 and 1990) and was arrested again for DuI in 1986.  This charge was dismissed, in spite of 
Applicant' acknowledged excessive drinking preceding his arrest.  As such, the offense merits being characterized as an alcohol-related incident.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was arrested twice more for alcohol-related offenses in 1993 and 1995.  In 1993, he was arrested for public intoxication: He had been drinking at a 
local tavern (consuming about 6 beers) and had left the tavern to go next door to buy cigarettes, when he was stopped and arrested for public intoxication (<EM>see</EM> 
ex. 5).  He was arrested again for public intoxication in October 1995 following his attendance at a private party, during which he consumed 3 to 4 drinks.  
After deciding against driving home in his state, he started back to the apartment when he was discovered by police asleep in his truck and arrested.  While no 
charges were filed in connection with his 1993 and 1995 incidents, both reflect alcohol-related incidents. </P> 
 
<P>Based on the interrogatory answers he returned in April 2003, Applicant continues to drink  2 to 3 days a week on average, consuming 3 to 6 beers at a time.  
He acknowledges drinking to intoxication from once a week to once every two weeks.  Without any indicated break in this drinking pattern, inferences warrant 
he has consumed alcohol at this frequency level since 1990.  When he is intoxicated he becomes drowsy and talkative.  His claimed changes in his drinking 
pattern are not reflected in any of his signed, sworn statements or interrogatory responses and cannot be credited without more documentation and 
corroboration.</P> 
 
<P>Asked to complete an SF-86 in September 2001, Applicant listed only his 1984 DuI arrest/conviction when responding to question 24.  He says he believes he 
attached a separate list of his remaining alcohol-related arrests but provides no proof beyond his assurances.  In a previously executed  SF-86 in January 1991, 
he listed several of his alcohol-related arrests.  Whether he omitted any at that time is not clear from the record.  When interviewed later (in July 1991) he 
supplied the details of his other alcohol-related incident that occurred before July 1991.  Whether Applicant provided this information voluntarily or due to 
prompting from the interviewing DSS agent is not clear.  As a result, no likely inclinations can be formed from the circumstances of his previous disclosures as 
to whether he was disposed to being truthful about his alcohol-arrests when completing his September 2001 SF-86. </P> 
 
<P>The SF-86 Applicant executed in September 2001 provides two places in which he can note other incidents that cannot be included in the space provided: both 
in the answer section of question 24 itself and in the general remarks portion of question 43.  Applicant made no note of other incidents when responding to 
question 24 and answered in the negative when responding to question 43 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 4). These answers are probative in assessing what Applicant's intentions 
were when he omitted his other alcohol-related incidents and suggest he did not want to disclose any more than he had to.  Without more to gauge the 
credibility of Applicant's written claims of  good intentions about disclosing all of his alcohol-related incidents in his 2001 SF-86, no favorable inferences 
warrant about his omissions being mistake-driven.  Rather, his omissions must be characterized as knowing and wilful absent more persuasive proofs his 
omissions were the result of mistaken failure to include </P> 
 
<P>his other incidents in an attachment to the SF-86.</P> 
 
<P>When interviewed by a DSS agent in March 2002 (over six months after he executed his SF-86), Applicant fully disclosed his previous alcohol-related 
incidents.  While he claims his disclosures were voluntary, his signed, sworn statement is less than clear about the circumstances of his disclosure and preclude 
any favorable finding on this correction claim of Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is highly regarded by his co-workers as a very responsible, hard working and trustworthy flight dispatcher.  As a member of his local union, he is 
credited with being very instrumental in achieving his union's first dispatchers' contract with the association of firms they work for.  He is praised for his 
efforts as his local's subsequently elected section chairman.</P>

</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the 
risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1 Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to 
alcohol use.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 5 Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions: </STRONG>None.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 2  The deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating conditions:</STRONG> None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical 
basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a praiseworthy work record, but also a record of security significant alcohol-related incidents and evidenced continued drinking at abusive levels, 
in addition to omissions about the extent of his alcohol-related incidents in his most recent SF-86.  Both his history of alcohol abuse and SF-86 omissions raise 
government concerns about his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Alcohol issues</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's seven characterized alcohol-related incidents over 28 years reflect alcohol abuse by Applicant (to include recurrent excessive over the included 
1977 to 1995 time frame).  Besides acknowledged earlier periods of abusive drinking, Applicant continues to drink at varying abusive levels, to include 
drinking to intoxication on a weekly to bi-weekly basis.  Never diagnosed as an abusive drinker or alcohol dependent, Applicant, nonetheless, has and continues 
to drink excessively while in social situations. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following his last alcohol-related incident (<EM>viz., </EM>his October1995 public intoxication incident), Applicant has avoided any recurrent incidents, both within and 
without his workplace.   On the strength of the evidence presented, two disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Adjudication Guidelines for alcohol consumption 
may be applied: DC 1 (alcohol-related incidents away from work) and DC 5 (habitual or binge drinking). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To his credit, Applicant has avoided any recurrent alcohol-related incidents for almost nine years now.   Still, he has been less than successful in weaning 
himself away from abusive drinking.  Even though his personal references express confidence in his technical competence and judgment, they fail to dispel 
doubts raised about his judgment lapses associated with his continued alcohol abuse.  His meritorious work record cannot be considered in isolation of the 
concerns raised about his continued abuse of alcohol.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By his actions to date, Applicant provides some evidence of learning from his judgment lapses associated with his alcohol-related incidents by avoiding any 
further such incidents since 1995.  This is not enough, however, to enable him to take advantage of any of the mitigating conditions (MC) of the Adjudication 
Guidelines for alcohol consumption to mitigate security concerns associated with his prior alcohol-related incidents and evidence of continued abusive 
drinking.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All in all, Applicant's mitigation efforts to date, while encouraging, are insufficient to absolve him of security concerns associated with his past and current 
alcohol abuses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the record as a whole, Applicant fails to make the convincing showing that he has both the maturity and resource support at his disposal to avert 
any recurrent problems with judgment lapses in the future.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the alcohol-related allegations covered by 
subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c of Guideline G. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Falsification issues</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Potentially serious and difficult  to reconcile with the trust and reliability requirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of 
Applicant's reporting his alcohol-related arrests in his 2001 SF-86.  So much trust is imposed on persons cleared to see classified information that  the tolerance 
threshold for accommodating judgment and trust slips is necessarily a low one. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By omitting all but a 1984 alcohol-related arrest when listing his past alcohol-related arrests in his 2001 SF-86, Applicant concealed materially important 
background information needed for the government to properly process and evaluate his security updates.  He makes no claim of misunderstanding the 
question, but rather attributes any omission to a mixup in the attached supplemental list he claims to believe he attached to the SF-86.  By this claim alone, 
Applicant has been unsuccessful in establishing the level of credibility necessary to disprove any deliberate intent associated with the omissions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">But  Applicant makes clear that he approached questions 27 and 28 of his respective SF-86s with the intent to withhold  information about past marijuana use as 
he could reasonably escape with.  His omissions were knowing, deliberate, and material to a determination about his clearance suitability.  They invite 
application of Disqualifying Conditions (DC) for personal conduct of the Adjudicative Guidelines: DC 2 (falsification of a security questionnaire) and DC 3 
(providing false information to an investigator).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with, since he failed to take any positive steps to correct his SF-86 omissions before being scheduled for a DSS 
interview in March 2002.  His disclosures in the DSS interview were not only the result of confrontation but they were neither isolated nor timely.  Not only has 
our Appeal Board found the use of Mitigating Condition (MC) 2 of the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal conduct (isolated, corrected falsification) to be 
unavailable to applicants seeking mitigation by treating the omission as isolated, but it has denied applicants availability of MC 3 (prompt, good faith 
disclosure) as well in circumstances (as here) where the applicant has failed to take advantage of an earlier DSS interview opportunity to make unprompted 
disclosures.  <EM>Compare </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0289 (January 1998) with DISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 1995).  Applicant in the present case is on record with 
not only falsifying his SF-86 but failing to correct his omissions in a timely and good-faith manner (free of confrontation). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There can be no doubt but that Applicant has performed well for his defense contractor.  But  in the face of his SF-86 omissions, his favorable character 
evidence alone is not enough to mitigate security concerns extant with the Government over his failure to be truthful in his  SF-86 submissions.  Considering all 
of the evidence produced in this record and the available guidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E.2.2 factors), unfavorable conclusions warrant with 
respect to sub-paragraph 2.a of Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P>
