<!--  
  A conviction falls under within the scope of 10 U.S.C. 986 when the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a term exceeding one year regardless of whether the sentence of imprisonment was suspended and regardless of the amount of time in jail the applicant actually served.  Adjudication  of a case under 10 U.S.C. 986 does not relieve an Administrative Judge from applying pertinent provisions of the Directive in a manner that is consistent with  the requirements of that statute as implemented by the Deputy Secretary of Defense's June 7, 2001 memorandum.  Given the record evidence in this case, the  Judge erred by not explaining why she concluded no Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions were applicable.  Judge's error does not warrant remand or  reversal.  Judge properly concluded Applicant's 1984 conviction falls under 10 U.S.C. 986.  Adverse decision affirmed.  The Board does not recommend this  case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. 986.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Lynn H. Ball, Esq.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has appealed the February 24, 2003 decision of Administrative Judge Darlene Lokey Anderson, in which the Judge concluded it is not clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's 1984 conviction falls under 10 U.S.C. 
&sect;986; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred by not concluding Applicant's criminal conduct was mitigated.  For the reasons that follow, the Board 
affirms the Administrative Judge's adverse decision, and does not recommend Applicant's case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated July 29, 2002.  The SOR was based on Guideline J 
(Criminal Conduct).  A hearing was held on January 16, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge issued a written decision, dated February 24, 2003, in which she concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from the Judge's adverse decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 
2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 
87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P>

</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's 1984 conviction falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge found: (a)  in 
1984 Applicant was found guilty of seven counts of bribery, violations of 18 U.S.C. &sect;201(c); (b) Applicant was sentenced to four years and eleven months in 
jail; (c) the sentence of imprisonment was suspended and Applicant was placed on five years probation, fined $3,000, and ordered to pay $2,685 in restitution; 
and (d) Applicant paid the fine, made restitution, and completed probation.  The Judge concluded that Applicant's bribery conviction falls under 10 U.S.C. 
&sect;986 and that application of that statute precluded a favorable security clearance decision.<A HREF="01-18827.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 
<P>On appeal, Applicant contends the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's 1984 conviction falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  In support of that 
contention, Applicant argues "since he completed probation successfully, his probation was not violated and he only did thirty days actual custody, then for 
purposes of Guideline J, the actual sentence should be the thirty days that he served."  For the reasons that follow, the Board finds Applicant's argument 
unpersuasive.</P> 
 
<P>The Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a June 7, 2001 memorandum (with attachments)<A HREF="01-18827.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
<P> providing guidance on how the Department of Defense would 
implement the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  To carry out the provisions of the June 7, 2001 memorandum, the Director, DOHA issued an operating 
instruction (dated July 10, 2001) which indicates the following:</P> 
 
<P>"Administrative Judges are responsible for initial resolution as to whether or not 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of the case."  (Operating Instruction, 
paragraph 2.e.)</P> 
 
<P>"In the event of an appeal raising an issue as to the applicability of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board is responsible for final resolution of the issue."  (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 2.f.)</P> 
 
<P>The Board has held that, under the provisions of the June 7, 2001 memorandum, an applicant's conviction falls within the scope of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 when the 
applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a term exceeding one year regardless of whether the sentence of imprisonment was suspended and 
regardless of the amount of time in jail the applicant actually served.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 01-13566 (April 15, 2003) at p. 5; ISCR Case No. 01-06337 
(September 24, 2002) at p. 3; ISCR Case No. 01-00407 (September 18, 2002) at p. 3.  Furthermore, the Board has held that an applicant's completion of 
probation does not take his or her case outside the scope of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-13566 (April 15, 2003) at pp. 5-6.  Accordingly, 
Applicant's appeal arguments fail to demonstrate the Judge erred by concluding his 1984 conviction falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 and precludes a favorable 
security clearance decision in his case.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by not concluding Applicant's criminal conduct was mitigated</SPAN>.  Applicant also contends the Administrative Judge 
should have concluded his past criminal conduct was mitigated under Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions 1<A HREF="01-18827.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
<P> and 2.<A HREF="01-18827.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
<P>  This contention fails to demonstrate 
harmful error by the Judge.</P> 
 
<P>According to the first attachment to the June 7, 2001 memorandum, "all cases potentially covered by [10 U.S.C. &sect;986] shall be fully investigated and 
adjudicated in accordance with current Executive Order and DoD Directive and Regulatory guidance, including applicable due process procedures."<A HREF="01-18827.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> 
<P>  
Therefore, adjudication of a case under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 does not relieve an Administrative Judge from applying pertinent provisions of the Directive in a 
manner that is consistent with requirements of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 as implemented by the June 7, 2001 memorandum and its attachments.</P> 
 
<P>The Board understands the first attachment to the June 7, 2001 memorandum as requiring an Administrative Judge to adjudicate cases covered by 10 U.S.C. 
&sect;986 as the Judge would have done prior to enactment of that statute<A HREF="01-18827.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 
<P> with additional steps being added to the adjudication.  Neither 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 nor the 
June 7, 2001 memorandum (or its attachments) relieves a Judge from the requirement to issue a written decision "setting forth pertinent findings of fact, 
policies, and conclusions as to the allegations in the SOR . . . ."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.25.  <EM>See also</EM> Directive, Section 6.3 
(indicating that each security clearance decision must be based upon consideration of all relevant and material information and pertinent provisions of the 
Adjudicative Guidelines).  In fulfilling that requirement, the Judge must apply pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines as revised by the attachments 
to the June 7, 2001 memorandum.<A HREF="01-18827.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> 
<P>  Furthermore, the Judge must decide whether or not to make a recommendation for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, 
pursuant to the provisions of the Operating Instruction.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal arguments raise the question of whether the Administrative Judge should have concluded his past criminal conduct was mitigated under 
Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions 1 and 2.  Regardless of the Judge's conclusion about the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, the Judge had the obligation 
to apply pertinent Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions.  Given the record evidence in this case, the Judge erred by not explaining why she concluded no 
Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions were applicable to Applicant's case.  However, because Applicant's 1984 conviction falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, the 
Judge could not have made a favorable security clearance decision based on application of Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions 1 and 2.<A HREF="01-18827.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> 
<P>  Accordingly, no 
useful purpose would be served by granting Applicant's request that the Board "remand this case back to the Administrative Judge for her to make findings of 
fact that there are mitigating circumstances which authorize the applicant to have a security clearance."</P> 
 
<P>Although Applicant is not entitled to the relief he requests, the Board will construe his arguments concerning mitigation as raising the issue of whether the 
Board should recommend his case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.  Under the Operating Instruction,</P> 
 
<P>"If an Administrative Judge issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Administrative Judge shall include 
without explanation either the statement 'I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'I do not recommend further 
consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'"  (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.e.)</P> 
 
<P>"If the Appeal Board issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board shall include without explanation 
either the statement 'The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'The Appeal Board does not recommend 
consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'" (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.f.)</P> 
 
<P>The Operating Instruction does not authorize the Board to review an Administrative Judge's recommendation whether or not a waiver should be considered.  
Furthermore, under the Operating Instruction, the Board is not authorized to give reasons or an explanation for its decision to recommend or not recommend 
that a waiver be considered, but only state without explanation either: (1) "The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 
986" or (2) "The Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986."  Since the Board is asked to make a 
recommendation in its own capacity, the Board is not bound by the recommendation made by the Judge below and must review the record evidence as a whole 
in order to fulfill its obligation to make a meaningful decision whether to recommend or not that a waiver should be considered.</P> 
 
<P>Recognizing the limits of its authority under the Operating Instruction, the Board has reviewed the record evidence as a whole and states the following: The 
Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusions</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Board affirms the Administrative Judge's conclusion that 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 applies to Applicant's 1984 conviction and precluded her from making a 
favorable security clearance decision in Applicant's case.  As noted above, the Appeal Board does not recommend further consideration of this case for a 
waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P>
