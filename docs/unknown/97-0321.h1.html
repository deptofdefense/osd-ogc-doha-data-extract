</P>

<P>	On May 2, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, issued the attached Statement of Reasons (SOR) to ---------------------  (Applicant), which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance
should be denied or revoked.</P>

<P>	The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on June 17, 1997 in which he elected to have
the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the
Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on July 18, 1997.  The Applicant
was instructed to submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt. 
Applicant received the FORM on August 4, 1997, and he submitted no reply.</P>

<P>	The case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on September 10, 1997.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Applicant is thirty years old, married, and employed by a defense contractor.  The
Applicant is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.</P>

<P>	The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of
allegations set forth in the attached Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are
entered as to each paragraph and criterion in the SOR:</P>

<P><U>Paragraph 1 (Criterion H - Drug Involvement)</U>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is
ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal substances.</P>

<P>	The Applicant has admitted to abusing marijuana several times a week, from 1989 to at least
September 1996.  His marijuana use normally occurred during the weekends and after work.  Other
than marijuana, he has not used any other illegal drug for the past seven years.</P>

<P>	During the period he used marijuana, he also purchased it in small quantities, less than an
ounce at a time.  The Applicant has never sold or manufactured marijuana or any other illegal drug.</P>

<P>	In a signed sworn statement to the Defense Investigative Service on September 19, 1996, the
Applicant stated  "Morally or philosophically, I see nothing wrong with my occasional use, and
intend to continue using it to enhance my experiences in recreational settings."  (See, Government
Exhibit 5).</P>

<P>	On June 17, 1997, the Applicant provided an answer to the Statement of Reasons wherein
he recants his previous statement concerning his intent to use marijuana in the future.  The Applicant
stated that when he made his statement on September 19, 1996, he was not aware that his security
clearance would be in jeopardy.  The Applicant now states that he intends to discontinue all future
involvement with marijuana.  (See, Government Exhibit 3).</P>

<P>	The Applicant further stated that the frequency of his use of marijuana in recent months has
been considerably reduced from occasional use to rare use, and to stop altogether would not be
difficult for him.  (See, Government Exhibit 3). </P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>POLICIES</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of
Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors and conditions that could
raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security
clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent
criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any
case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense. 
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be
assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case. 
Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this
case are:</P>

<P><U><CENTER>Criterion H (Drug Involvement)</U></CENTER>
</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could raise a security concern</U>:</P>

<P>	(1) any drug abuse;</P>

<P>	(2) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, proceeding, manufacture, purchase , sale
or distribution.</P>

<P><U>Condition that could mitigate security concerns</U>:</P>

<P>None.	</P>

<P>	In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at page 2-1,  "In evaluating the
relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general
factors:</P>

<P>	 a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</P>

<P>	b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P>

<P> </P>

<P>	c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<P>	d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<P>	e.  The voluntariness of participation</P>

<P>	f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</P>

<P>	g.  The motivation for the conduct </P>

<P>	h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P>

<P> 	I.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence."</P>

<P>	The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and
conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order
10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request
for access to classified information.</P>

<P>	The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period
of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these
personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of
variables known as the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person,
past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The
Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical
basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in
Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order...shall be a determination in terms of
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant
concerned."</P>

<P><STRONG><U><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian
workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day. 
The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an
Applicant for clearance may be involved in off-duty illegal drug abuse which demonstrates poor
judgment or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</P>

<P>	It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding
of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a
security clearance.  If such a <EM>prima facie</EM> case has been established, the burden then shifts to the
Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to
overcome or outweigh the Government's <EM>prima facie</EM> case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden
of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interests to grant him or her a
security clearance.</P>

<P>	The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance
holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.  If an Applicant has
demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in his private affairs, then there exists the possibility that
he or she may demonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and regulations.  The improper
involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect
classified information.</P>

<P>	In this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by <EM>prima facie</EM> evidence
that the Applicant has used illegal drugs (Criterion H).  The Applicant, on the other hand, has not
introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome
the Government's <EM>prima facie</EM> case against him. </P>

<P>	The record evidence clearly shows that the Applicant has violated the law by using and
purchasing marijuana at various times extending over a period of at least seven years, beginning in
1989, and continuing until at least as recently as September 1996.  In September 1996, the Applicant
stated that he intended on continuing his use of marijuana in certain social settings, irrespective of
the fact that its use and purchase is illegal and prohibited.  Nine months later, on June 17, 1997, the
Applicant stated that he changed his position because he became aware that his security clearance
was is in jeopardy, and does not now intend to involve himself with marijuana in the future.  Less
than three months ago, the Applicant decided to stop his involvement with marijuana altogether. 
The Applicant is commended for his recent effort to completely abstain from marijuana.  However,
considering the Applicant's seven year history of marijuana use, the fact that he initially stated that
he intended to continue using marijuana in the future, and the fact that he has only been drug free
somewhere between two months and one year, there has not been sufficient time in rehabilitation
to show that the Applicant will not return to his old ways.  This does not, however, preclude the
Applicant from applying for a security clearance at some future date when there is additional
evidence to support his full rehabilitation.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Criterion
H, (Drug Involvement).</P>

<P>	On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's <EM>prima
facie</EM> case opposing his request for a continued security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence
supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed
in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by
Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</P>

<P>			Paragraph 1: Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>			    Subpara.	1.a.:	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>			    Subpara.	1.b.:	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>			    Subpara.	1.c.:	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>			<CENTER><STRONG><U>DECISION</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</P>
