  Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Applicant had a reasonable opportunity during the proceedings below to offer documentary evidence or testimony for the Administrative Judge to consider in his case.  Applicant cannot fairly challenge the Judge's  decision based on a proffer of evidence that he did not present for the Judge's consideration during the proceedings below.  The security  significance of Applicant's falsification is not diminished by the adverse effects that an unfavorable security clearance decision could have on  him personally.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated January 16, 2004, which 
stated the reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Barry M. Sax issued an unfavorable security clearance 
decision, dated October 13, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issue has been raised on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge should have concluded that Applicant's falsification of a 
security clearance application was extenuated or mitigated.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's 
decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine 
whether there is factual or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with 
specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with 
specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or 
capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or 
conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant 
evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the 
choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it 
offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere 
difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the 
Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, 
the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are 
conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of 
fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary 
evidence in the same record.  In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the 
Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is 
record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence 
supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a 
Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on 
appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at 
pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  
<EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, Applicant does not challenge the Administrative Judge's finding that he falsified a security clearance application.  Rather, 
Applicant asks the Board to reverse the Judge's unfavorable decision because: (a) he has taken significant steps toward becoming financially 
stable; (b) he did not want his employer to find out about his financial problems; (c) his military service and personal life show positive things 
that should weigh in his favor; and (d) an unfavorable security clearance decision will have significant adverse effects on his employment 
situation and his personal life.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge entered formal findings in favor of Applicant with respect to Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  Because the 
Judge did not base his unfavorable decision on Applicant's history of financial difficulties, Applicant's comments about his financial situation 
are moot.</P> 
 
<P>The record evidence does not support the statement in Applicant's appeal brief about not wanting his employer to find out about his financial 
problems.  As such, it constitutes new evidence that the Board cannot consider on appeal.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, 
Item E3.1.29.  Applicant had a reasonable opportunity during the proceedings below to offer documentary evidence or testimony for the Judge 
to consider in his case.  Applicant cannot fairly challenge the Judge's decision based on a proffer of evidence that he did not present for the 
Judge's consideration during the proceedings below.</P> 
 
<P>There is little record evidence concerning Applicant's military service and personal life.  Given the sparse record evidence about those 
matters, it was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Administrative Judge to conclude that Applicant has not presented evidence 
that  extenuated or mitigated his falsification of the security clearance application.</P> 
 
<P>The federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to classified information.  The 
adverse consequences an unfavorable security clearance decision may have on an applicant are irrelevant to an Administrative Judge's 
determination as to whether the applicant poses the high level of judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness necessary to be granted a security 
clearance.  The security significance of Applicant's falsification of a security clearance application is not diminished by the adverse effects 
that an unfavorable security clearance decision  could have on him personally.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-09209 (June 9, 2004) at p. 5; 
ISCR Case No. 02-11570 (May 19, 2004) at p. 8.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has not demonstrated error below.  Therefore, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's security clearance decision.</P>
