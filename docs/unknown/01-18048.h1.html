<P>Although Applicant's finances and his company's finances were essentially the same, the company's financial issues had no security significance where they 
were due largely to the actions of one dishonest employee and two incompetent ones, and where Applicant had taken effective steps to reorganize the company

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>On 1 April 2002<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-18048.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. </SPAN>On 7 June 
2002, Applicant an Answer and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on 27 August 2002 while I was out of the country on military duty, and 
received by me upon my return on 9 September 2002. On 9 October 2002, I set the case for hearing and issued a Notice of Hearing (NOH) the same day, for a 
hearing on 13 November 2002.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>At the hearing, the government submitted 32 exhibits--admitted without objection--and no witnesses. The Applicant submitted 27 exhibits and the testimony 
of four witnesses, including himself. DOHA received the transcript on 21 November 2002.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the financial allegations of the SOR, except for subparagraphs1.a., o., p., q., and r. While he admitted not filing the state and federal income 
tax returns alleged in paragraph 2, he denied doing so with the wilfulness alleged.</SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant--a 33 year-old founder, chairman of the board, and majority stockholder of a small firm doing business as a defense contractor--seeks access to 
classified information. He is a highly-skilled computer engineer with an impressive array of extremely technical qualifications.</P> 
<P>Applicant founded his company in approximately 1990 as a sole proprietorship, and incorporated in approximately 1992 as the sole stockholder. During the 
early years of the company, when Applicant was the sole employee, he had company and personal financial matters--including company and personal 
taxes--taken care of by an outside Certified Public Accountant. By 1996, when the company had grown to 5-6 employees and hoped to grow bigger, Applicant 
realized that he needed more help managing the company so  he could focus on the technical end of the business. He hired an individual to serve as Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), a man he knew in high school who came to the job with an impressive set of business and legal 
credentials. Shortly after hiring the CEO/CFO, Applicant hired a CPA recommended by the CEO/CFO to serve as the company's CFO. Applicant was to serve 
as the Chief Technical Officer (CTO) and execute the contracts with the client agencies. The CEO would generate new business. The CFO would keep the 
books, including the corporate taxes and Applicant's personal taxes.<A HREF="01-18048.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant had, through no fault of his own, hired badly. Expected additional contracts did not materialize. By December 1998--when the company had grown 
to about 12 employees--Applicant became sufficiently concerned about the state of the company that he hired an outside attorney who later became corporate 
counsel (CC) to review the company's operations and recommend improvements. CC began his review of the company in January 1999, and by February 1999 
had reached his tentative conclusions, hampered by the fact that the company's financial books were not complete. The CFO was either unable or unwilling to 
perform the work he had been hired to do. As a CPA, he considered himself above performing the basic bookkeeping functions required by his position. The 
CFO spent company funds on personal items, failed to close any of the "big" contracts that were pending, and apparently locked the company into a long-term 
computer lease which had no escape clauses for business downturns.</P> 
<P>Because of the largely unknown financial status of the company, CC recommended that Applicant fire the CEO and CFO for their malfeasance and lay off the 
remaining employees until CC could get the books in order and have a firm understanding of the company's financial standing. Applicant took this advice. 
However, CC made one bad recommendation himself: the hiring of a CPA (that he had used himself) to get the company's financial records in shape. The CPA 
succeeded in getting the books into better shape, and actually prepared Applicant's state and federal income tax returns as required. However, she failed to get a 
handle on the company's state withholding tax obligations and she failed to mail Applicant's income tax returns after Applicant had signed them. In 1999-2000, 
the tax side of the company's financial picture began to fall apart, but Applicant was not aware of the problem until the company began to receive deficiency 
notices from numerous state taxing authorities and the IRS. The CPA was let go in approximately March 2000 and a new CPA hired.</P> 
<P>Except for the business debts in subparagraph 1.a. and r., all the debts alleged in the SOR are company obligations for corporate business taxes (to the IRS and 
the state where the company is incorporated ) or state withholding taxes (for employees residing in the state where the company is incorporated as well as two 
other states). Except for the debt to the IRS, all the tax accounts have been paid, several before the issuance of the SOR.<A HREF="01-18048.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant submitted an offer in 
compromise to the IRS in September 2001 (G.E. 7; AE. N) for the remaining tax debts (1.d.-m., s; G.E. 14-17); however the IRS changed the required 
submission forms, and the company is preparing to resubmit the offer in compromise.<A HREF="01-18048.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The company is also arranging commercial lines of credit to pay the 
debt if the IRS refuses the offer in compromise.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">When Applicant cut back the company's business operation in 1999, he attempted to void the computer lease negotiated by the former CEO. That company 
sued for breach of contract in September 1999, but settled with Applicant's company in February for a lower total figure than the original lease (1.a.; G.E. 3, 4). 
By the time the SOR was issued in April 2002, Applicant's company had made all the required payments and reduced the outstanding balance to $920.00, 
which was paid in May 2002 (A.E. B).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On 12 October 1999, Applicant executed the Security Clearance Application (SCA)(SF-86)(G.E. 1) to begin the background investigation for the clearance at 
issue in this case. Applicant truthfully disclosed the existence of financial issues related to his company finances as well as the name and address of the attorney 
he had hired to resolve those financial issues. On 31 March 2000, Applicant detailed the progress he had made sorting through the company's financial issues to 
the Defense Security Service (G.E. 2).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">When Applicant and CC were attempting to rebuild the company in 2000, they entered into a contract with a corporate headhunter (1.r.) that required 
Applicant's company to pay the headhunter a portion of the first-year salary for any employee the headhunter located. The headhunter located an employee, who 
failed to generate any business for Applicant's company, and was quickly let go. The headhunter demanded payment, Applicant's company refused; the 
headhunter sued for breach of contract, but settled for a much lower figure in June 2001.<A HREF="01-18048.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's company will gross $3.5-4.0 million in revenue in 2002, and expects 2003 revenues to reach $6.0 million. The company was 3-4 employees in the 
wake of the 1999 cutbacks, but is now 25-35 strong. Several user agencies are completely satisfied with the company's performance on their contracts, and with 
Applicant's competence and character.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was extremely credibly when he testified that he took action to cure the company's financial shortcomings as soon as he became aware of them. His 
witnesses were equally credible in describing their part in the company's turn-around, and corroborating Applicant's efforts. Applicant has changed the 
corporate structure so that he is no longer the sole stockholder, and has hired a more professional management team to grow the company. He acquired a 
smaller company in approximately 2001 (in order to protect his company's access to needed software); the founder of that company now serves as the President 
of Applicant's company. The President opined that the company had sufficient revenues to make the tax payment required in 1999-2000 but for the CPA's 
failure to keep good financial records. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant recalls signing his personal state and income tax returns in a timely fashion (Tr. 106, 115). He acknowledged that his progress in getting complete 
control over his company's finances was complicated by the fact that he was diagnosed with a rare form of thyroid cancer in 1994, the required annual or semi-annual treatments for which are extremely debilitating, taking him out of the picture 8-10 weeks at a time. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case under Guideline F. However, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. Having carefully examined the evidence in 
this case, it appears that the government only marginally established its case under Guideline F. Although Applicant (and his company) were the victims of a 
dishonest employee, and two incompetent ones, it does not appear that Applicant (or his company) was either unwilling or unable to meet his financial 
obligations at the time they arose. Even if I conclude that the government has established its case--insofar as the dishonest employee placed Applicant and the 
company in the position of having to come up with large sums of past-due payments--I conclude that the financial issues have been mitigated by the 
circumstances of the financial difficulties and Applicant's response. Once Applicant became aware of the financial disruption caused by his employees, he took 
reasonable steps to address those issues. The interim step--hiring the bookkeeper--was not completely effective because the complexity of the  financial issues 
exceeded her level of expertise. Still, Applicant persevered, hiring an attorney and bringing in additional company staff to resolve the financial issues. The 
company has continued to grow, has an enviable revenue stream, and is meeting its current financial obligations. While the IRS debt is still pending, 
Applicant's company has contingencies in place whatever way the IRS rules</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In similar fashion, the government has not established its case under Guideline J. Although Applicant admitted that he did not file the state returns in 1997-2000 
and federal returns in 1997, 1998 and 2000, he credibly denied doing so willfully as alleged in the SOR. Wilful failure is a requirement under both the state and  
federal statute cited in the SOR. Nevertheless, to have security significance, there must be something about the conduct to suggest Applicant lacks the 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of those with access to classified information. Applicant testified credibly that he hired someone at the 
company to be responsible for preparing and filing his state and federal income tax returns consistent with rule governing declaration of income from sole 
proprietorship or small business, and that he recalled being asked by the person preparing the tax returns to sign them. He was not aware that the returns had not 
been filed until the IRS and state tax authority contacted him about the missing tax returns. Further, while not necessarily dispositive of the issue, the fact that 
neither the IRS nor the state tax authority have pursued criminal sanctions against Applicant suggests that neither views Applicant's failures to file as a criminal 
matter. I resolve Guideline J for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
