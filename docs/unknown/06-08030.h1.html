<P>Applicant is 52 years old and employed as a painter by a defense contractor for about four years. He has delinquent debt totaling approximately $61,000. He also deliberately falsified material facts 
on several questions on his security clearance application. He has a history of criminal activity, which includes approximately 10 arrests. He has also been incarcerated, and on two separate 
occasions, he served more than one year in jail. Applicant is prohibited from holding a security clearance based on his incarcerations for more than a year in 1985 and 1990. Applicant has failed to 
mitigate the criminal conduct, personal conduct, and financial considerations security concerns. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On April 8, 2004, Applicant executed a security a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).<A HREF="06-08030.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On June 13, 2006, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">under Guideline J 
(Criminal Conduct), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be 
granted or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn, written statement, certified on August 8, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested an in-person hearing. The case was assigned to me on September 26, 2006. A 
Notice of Hearing was issued on October 6, 2006, scheduling the hearing for October 27, 2006. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government submitted nine exhibits,

<P>A credit bureau report, dated August 13, 2006, which serves as a basis for the financial allegations in the SOR, indicates Applicant has five debts, totaling approximately $61,107. The debts at issue 
are as follows:</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions 
(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant 
and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding 
circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or 
undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</P> 
 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.<A HREF="06-08030.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> The Government 
has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="06-08030.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="06-08030.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant 
to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="06-08030.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance 
decision.<A HREF="06-08030.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="06-08030.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="06-08030.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> Any reasonable 
doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information.<A HREF="06-08030.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a 
security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="06-08030.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of 
Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Guideline J</STRONG> <STRONG>(Criminal Conduct):  </STRONG><EM>The Concern:</EM>  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  </STRONG><EM>The Concern:  </EM>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline F</STRONG> <STRONG>(Financial Considerations):  </STRONG><EM>The Concern:</EM>  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed 
in the conclusions below.</P> 
 
<P>A provision of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(c)(1) (Smith Amendment), which was subsequently amended and revised, mandates 
restrictions on the granting or renewal of security clearances. Under the provision, a person convicted in any court of the United States of a crime, who was sentenced to imprisonment for a term 
exceeding one year, and was incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than one year, may not be granted a security clearance by DoD. In meritorious cases, the disqualification may be 
waived.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the following conclusions.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct. Applicant has been convicted of the following: financial transaction card theft and 
credit card fraud in 1984; writing bad checks in 1984; violation of employment security law in 1985; theft of an automobile; forgery in 1990; embezzlement 1990, and a few other charges of failure 
to appear, trespassing, and a couple of probation violations. Consequently, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>allegations or admission of criminal conduct, 
regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>) and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>) apply.</P> 
 
<P>Various factors can mitigate the criminal conduct security concern. However, since there is a plethora of criminal charges of different types against Applicant for 1984 to 2000. None of the available 
Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions apply. Moreover, Title 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(c)(1) applies with respect to two of Applicant's convictions. He was convicted of larceny and served one year and 
one day of incarceration. His conviction for grand larceny and forgery included three years of incarceration. Applicant has not mitigated the Government's case. Accordingly, allegations 1.a through 
1.f, and 1.h through 1.m are concluded against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the central question whether the person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified 
information.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Applicant deliberately falsified material facts on his SF 86. He failed to list that he had been charged with or convicted of felony offenses in 1984, 1985, and 1990. He then failed to disclose that on 
at least two separate occasions in 2000, he had been arrested and/or charged with offenses. Finally, he did not disclose that he had debts that were more than 180 or 90 days delinquent. 
Consequently, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification fo relevant and material facts from any personnel security 
questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>) applies. None of the available Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions apply. Applicant has not mitigated the Government's case. Accordingly, 
allegations 2.a through 2.e are concluded against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline F, a security concern exists for an individual who is financially overextended. The person is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet 
financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information. 
Applicant has a history of financial problems. His current delinquent debts total approximately $61,107. Thus Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>a history of 
not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>) apply.</P> 
 
<P>Various conditions can mitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties. Nearly two-thirds of Applicant's debt, $40,477, is for outstanding child support payments. Moreover, there is a 
$20,000 tax lien against him. Yet, Applicant has a car note for a 2002 BMW for $752. Undoubtedly, a lower car payment would give him more liquidity so he could pay greater amounts to reduce 
his child support arrears and outstanding tax debts. Applicant is a prime candidate for participating in financial counseling, since he was unaware of his spending habits or monthly outlay of 
expenses at the hearing. Consequently, none of the available Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions apply. Applicant has not mitigated the Government's case. Accordingly, allegations 3.a 
through 3.e are concluded against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the evidence in the case. I have also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant has a 
hard time acting as a mature, responsible adult. Applicant has a criminal history with a myriad of arrests and charges, including being in and out of jail numerous times between 1984 and 2000. 
oreover, he deliberately falsified several questions on his SF 86. Based on the evidence of record, however, it is clearly not consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security 
clearance. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not suitable for access to classified information.</P>
