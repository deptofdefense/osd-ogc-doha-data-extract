<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) proposed to deny or revoke Applicant's access  to unclassified automation systems in an ADP-III sensitivity position.  On August 4, 2005, 
DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that proposal--security concerns raised under Guideline F <EM>(Financial Considerations</EM>) of Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  On September 12, 2005, Applicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. On April 21, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge 
Joseph Testan denied Applicant's request for access to an ADP-III position.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge found that Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in October 1997 and received a discharge in bankruptcy in January 1998.  However, after that, Applicant 
continued to experience financial problems, having over $30,000 of unpaid debt at the time of the hearing.  </P> 
 
<P>On appeal Applicant does not challenge the Administrative Judge's findings.  However, she draws attention to her excellent work record and states that she will not place her job in jeopardy for 
financial gain. </P> 
 
<P>The Appeal Board's authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the Administrative Judge committed harmful error.  Applicant has not made an allegation 
of harmful error. Therefore, the decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant access to an ADP-III position is AFFIRMED.</P>
