<P>In September of 1996, when he was 19 years old, Applicant was arrested for using marijuana in his university dormitory room.  In January 1997, Applicant was 
arrested and charged with possession of marijuana near a school with intent to distribute.  Subsequently, Applicant was convicted and sentenced to confinement 
for five years.  Applicant sufficiently mitigated the drug abuse and criminal conduct security concerns, but, as a result of his sentence to confinement for five 
years, the Department of Defense is prohibited from granting or continuing a security clearance for him absent a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 by the Secretary of 
Defense.  Clearance is denied.  I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 4 September 2003, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="03-15580.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="03-15580.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in a writing 
notarized on 10 October 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 4 November 2003.  On 6 January 
2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA 
received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 13 January 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P>

<P>In September 1996, when he was a 19-year-old university freshman, Applicant was arrested by university police for smoking marijuana in a dormitory.  He was 
charged with possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia.  Tr. 28.  He subsequently paid a $353 fine.  In January 1997, campus police

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H-Drug Involvement</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was arrested and convicted in 1997 of possession of a controlled substance near a school (&para;&para; 1.a.), and was arrested in 
1996 for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, but convicted of only possession of drug paraphernalia (&para;&para; 1.b.).  An applicant's improper or illegal 
involvement with drugs raises questions about his willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or 
occupational functioning, increasing the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A8.1.1.1.</P> 
 
<P>The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that he used and possessed marijuana.  Any drug abuse (DC E2.A8.1.2.1.) and 
illegal drug possession (DC E2.A8.1.2.2.) are disqualifying conditions.  However, Applicant's involvement with illegal drugs was not recent (MC 
E2.A8.1.3.1.)-he has not used any illegal drugs in seven years.  He has demonstrated an intent not to abuse any drugs in the future (MC E2.A8.1.3.3.).  After 
considering these mitigating conditions, along with the adjudicative process factors found in &para; 6.3 of the Directive, including his age at the time of his 
involvement with drugs, I conclude Applicant has sufficiently mitigated any security concerns about his use of drugs.  I find for Applicant.  </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had been convicted of criminal acts discussed under Guideline H and, because he received a sentence of more than one 
year in confinement, the Department of Defense is prohibited from granting him a clearance absent a waiver from the Secretary of Defense.  10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  
A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that he engaged in criminal conduct (DC E2.A10.1.2.1.) of a serious nature 
(DC E2.A10.1.2.2.)-possession of marijuana with intent to distribute near a school.  Applicant's criminal behavior was not recent.  MC E2.A10.1.3.1.  His 
criminal conduct occurred during a six-month period while he was 19 years old, over seven years ago.  He has not been in trouble since.  He has earned an 
education, is the custodial parent of his daughter, and has turned his life around.  He is now a productive member of society.  This is clear evidence of 
Applicant's successful rehabilitation.  MC E2.A10.1.3.6.  I would find for Applicant if I were not prohibited from doing so by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of being sentenced to five years in confinement as a result of the conviction for possession near a school with intent to distribute marijuana, Applicant 
is subject to the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  The provisions of that statute apply even though Applicant did not serve any time in prison for that offense.  
ISCR Case No. 01-13566 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2003).  Under the circumstances, I am required to find against Applicant on &para; 1.a.  However, I recommend 
further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1.  Guideline H: FOR APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.b.: For Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 2.  Guideline J: AGAINST APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 2.a.: Against Applicant</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is denied.  I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</P>
