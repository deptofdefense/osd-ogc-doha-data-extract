<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On February 20, 2004, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 17, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge 
Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline J is arbitrary, capricious or 
contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge should have concluded that the security concerns raised under Guideline J had been mitigated, as a matter of 
law, because his criminal conduct is not recent and he has demonstrated he is now rehabilitated.<A HREF="03-08336.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The Board does not find Applicant's arguments persuasive. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  
Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. 
Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of 
fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice versa</EM>.  An 
applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to 
demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this case, the Administrative Judge made sustainable findings that Applicant had pled guilty in 1989 to Theft by Unauthorized Taking or Transfer, a felony.  
That offense had involved multiple breaches of Applicant's fiduciary duty as a broker for an insurance company--the misappropriation of funds from eight 
clients.  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible 
application of relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying any mitigating conditions in this case, and 
reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, 
e.g.,  </EM>ISCR Case No. 03-11112 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2006).  Given the record that was before her, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under 
Guideline J is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
