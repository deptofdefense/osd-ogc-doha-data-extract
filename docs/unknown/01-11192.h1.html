<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 28, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 13, 2001, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was transferred 
to the undersigned on November 27, 2001.  A notice of hearing was issued on December 5, 2001.  The hearing was held on January 16, 2002, at which the 
Government presented ten exhibits.  The Applicant presented six exhibits.  The Applicant testified on his own behalf. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant submitted one Post 
Hearing exhibit consisting of items 1 through 4.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">January 25, 2002.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 16, 2000, a memorandum was issued by Mr. Arthur Money, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and 
Intelligence, clarifying "the application of Guideline C to cases involving an Applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport."  (Hereafter referred to as the 
oney Memorandum).  The Applicant received a copy of the Money Memorandum on January 4, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the testimony.  The Applicant is 51 years of age, and has a Ph.D. 
in Engineering and Science.  He is President of his company, a defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the 
defense industry.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in 
such a way as to show a preference for another country over the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was born in Iran in 1950.  He came to the United States in 1976, on a student visa to attend college.  He became a permanent resident in 1985, 
and a naturalized citizen of the United States in May 1991.  In June 1991, the Applicant obtained his first United States passport.  His current United States 
passport will expire in June 2011.  (Tr. P. 27).  He obtained a passport issued by the Iranian Government in May 1978, that expired in December 1985.  He then 
renewed his Iranian passport in November 1986, that did not expire until November 1989.  His current Iranian passport, renewed in October 1999, will not 
expire until September 2004.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant testified that in August 1999, he accompanied his mother to Turkey to help her obtain her permanent residency status from the American 
Embassy, to enable her to come to the United States.  The Applicant explained that he used his Iranian passport to enter the country of Turkey, in lieu of using 
his United States passport, to avoid having to have his mother wait in line, as she was ill, could not stand and there were no wheelchairs.  The Applicant stated 
that if one carries an Iranian passport, one does not have to wait in line to get a visa.  To exit Turkey, however, he used his United States passport.  The Turkish 
customs officer noticed that his United States passport had not been stamped upon his arrival in Turkey.  The Applicant explained that to expedite matters he 
had used his Iranian passport instead of obtaining a visa.  The Turkish customs officer assumed that the Applicant had come into the country illegally to avoid 
paying the $100.00 fee for the visa.  After being questioned and detained for about two to three hours by Turkish customs, the Applicant was permitted to pay 
the $100.00 to get his passport stamped, and was then permitted to leave.  (Tr. pp. 36-38, and Government Exhibit 7, p.16).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant stated that the reason he obtained an Iranian passport in October 1999, after becoming a United States citizen, was because he wanted to give his 
mother power of attorney to sell their property in Teheran.  Under the inheritance laws in Iran, the children inherit an interest in the estate of the deceased 
parent.  (Government Exhibit 7, p. 23).  Iranian law requires that  in order to give his mother power of attorney to sell their property in Teheran, the Applicant 
needed to obtain an Iranian passport.  The Applicant stated that the intention was then to have the proceeds of the sale transferred to the United States.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant states that upon receipt of the Money Memorandum and appraisal of its ramifications, he sent his Iranian passport to the Pakistan Embassy.  (Tr. 
p. 57).  He later testified that he asked his mother to send his passport back.  (Tr. p. 87).  He then testified that his sister sent it back, because his mother is ill, 
and unable to go to the Post Office.  (Tr. p.87).  He then stated that he asked his sister to send it back under his name.  (Tr. p. 87).  He stated that since moving 
from the east coast to the west coast in 1982, he left his passport with his mother on the east coast, and has not had possession of it since then.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant submitted a copy of a certified mail receipt from a United States post office that indicates that he mailed something on December 15, 2001, to the 
Pakistani Embassy in Washington D.C.  There is no evidence in the record, however, that indicates what the item actually was, or whether it was delivered or 
received by said embassy.  (<EM>See</EM>, Applicant's Post Hearing Exhibit Items 1- 4). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant testified that the last time he traveled to Iran was in 1976.  (Tr. p. 78).  Over the years, when he would arrange to visit his parents who resided in 
Iran, he would either meet them in Europe, or they came to the United States.  However, a witness for the Applicant testified that the Applicant told him that he 
traveled to Iran about three months after his father died in 1999, and that the purpose of the trip was to settle his father's affairs.  (<EM>See</EM>, Tr. p. 114). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign 
contacts that could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's mother and two sister are citizens of Iran.  His mother, who is ill, has recently moved to the United States, and is a permanent resident of the 
United States.  The Applicant  telephones her several times a day.  Her residence in Iran is currently for sale.  The Applicant has two sisters who are Iranian 
citizens, and reside in Iran.  They have applied to come to the United States.  The Applicant states that he usually contacts his sisters on the Persian New Year 
and Christmas.  The Applicant states, however, that he maintains a close relationship with his family .  (Government Exhibit 7, p. 2).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has one sister and one brother who reside in the United States, and are  naturalized citizens of the United States.  The Applicant's father passed 
away in 1999.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant also has an aunt and two cousins who are citizens of Canada, and who reside there.  One of these cousins is temporarily living in Paris.  The 
Applicant states that his only contact with these extended family members may be on the Persian New Year and on Christmas.  (Tr. P. 90).  The Applicant has 
only a few friends from Iran in the United States.  (Government Exhibit 7, pp. 36-37).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant maintains a close relationship with a friend who is a citizen of Great Britain but is employed in Norway.  The Applicant stated that his friend, 
who was previously his boss at another company, as well as his former thesis advisor at a University he attended,  is a consultant with one of the most sensitive 
programs for the Department of Energy, on the storage of high level radioactive wastes outside of Las Vegas.  Since 1985, the Applicant has been in regular 
contact with him, and has consulted with him on technical issues.  The Applicant was also his friend's best man at his wedding in September 2000.  The 
Applicant stated that his friend comes to the United States very often.  When he does come, they usually get together for dinner.  The Applicant states that his 
friend does not know about his military work at all.  They only talk about their commercial projects.  (Tr. p. 54).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant states that as far as he knows, he has never held a security clearance from the Department of Defense, but he has worked for the Department of 
Defense for about twenty years.  (Tr. p. 85).  In the Applicant's sworn statement to the Defense Security Service dated February 16, 2001, various officials from 
other countries have expressed an interest in his company and/or his specialized field of knowledge.  (Government's  Exhibit 7, pp. 39- 45).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant testified that he has received numerous acknowledgments for his professional work with the United States Government and the military.  A letter 
from a Lieutenant General in the United States Air Force thanked the Applicant for his super work that was done to assist the Swiss military in an investigation 
of a major accident that took the life of many military personnel in the Swiss Alps.  (Applicant's Exhibit E).  The Applicant stated that he received other letters 
of commendation from distinguished members of the Congress, two from United States Senators, and one from the Chief of Staff.   (Tr. p. 83). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors 
and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These 
factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in 
any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on her own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique 
facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings 
of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Preference</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide 
information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. The exercise of dual citizenship;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence 
that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant 
to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. An immediate family member, or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  Relatives, cohabitants or associates who are connected with any foreign government;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">7.  Indications that representatives or nationals from a foreign country are acting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future exploitation, 
coercion, or pressure. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  I.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is eligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference) and Guideline B (foreign influence) that establishes doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and her ability to 
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates a foreign preference and has foreign connections may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to 
the interests of the United States.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to 
place the interests of the United States paramount to that of another nation. The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security 
clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the 
written record, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's foreign 
contacts have a direct and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has held an Iranian passport since 1978.  After becoming a naturalized citizen of the United States in May 1991, and after being issued a United 
States passport in June 1991, the Applicant renewed his Iranian passport in October 1999, to give power of attorney to his mother in order to transfer property 
and to ultimately receive a financial benefit.  After becoming a United States citizen, he has also used his Iranian passport for the convenience of traveling to 
Turkey, rather than waiting in line for a visa like any other citizen of the United States would have had to do under the circumstances. Indeed, the Applicant has 
continued to possess an Iranian passport for the convenience it provides to him during international travel.  Although he states that he has recently returned his 
Iranian passport, by maintaining both an Iranian passport and a passport from the United States over the years, he has remained a dual citizen of both Iran and 
the United States. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is also great confusion in the record as to whether the Applicant actually traveled to Turkey or Iran in 1999.  His own witness testified that he traveled to 
Iran in 1999.  This completely contradicts the Applicant's testimony.  This fact standing alone raises serious questions about the Applicant's credibility, and 
thus his suitability for access to classified information.  Not withstanding this, the evidence is clear that he entered at least one of these countries in 1999, using 
his Iranian passport after having become an American citizen.  Thus, the Applicant has not demonstrated an unequivocal preference for the United States.  
Under the circumstances of this case, I find against the Applicant under Guideline C. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, there is absolutely no evidence in the record to establish that what was mailed by the Applicant's sister, on December 15, 2001, in the name of the 
Applicant, was indeed the Applicant's passport, nor is there any evidence that establishes that the Applicant's passport was ever delivered to the Pakistani 
Embassy or the Iranian interest section, or that they ever received the Applicant's passport.  The evidence submitted establishes only that something was mailed.  
Accordingly, I cannot find that the Applicant is in compliance with the Money Memorandum.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline B, the Applicant states on the one hand, that he has a close relationship with his family.  On the other hand, he states that he has 
minimal contact with his two sisters who live in Iran, and who are Iranian citizens of long standing.  Furthermore, although his mother is now a permanent 
resident of the United States, she is still a citizen of Iran.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has also maintained a close and continuing foreign contact with a British citizen who is not only a very close friend, but is also a professional 
colleague.  Given the extremely sensitive nature of the work that the Applicant does, these contacts present enough questions, and possibilities of potential 
threat, that it would not be in the best interests of the security of the United States to allow Applicant access to the nation's secrets.  There also remains the 
possibility of pressure being placed on these foreign contacts, and through them, on the Applicant.  It is the Applicant's burden to show that these ties are not of 
a nature that could create the potential for influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  He has not done so.  Accordingly, I cannot 
say that he would not be vulnerable to foreign influence.  The risk is considerable, and is of present security significance.  Accordingly, the Applicant's request 
for a security clearance must be denied under Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has  not rebutted the Government's case regarding his foreign influence and foreign preference.  The Applicant has 
not met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines C and B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his 
ultimate burden of persuasion under Paragraph 1 and 2 of the SOR.</SPAN></P>
