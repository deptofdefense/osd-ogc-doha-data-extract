<P>Applicant used marijuana from 1982 to 2001.  He was arrested three times.  He failed to list his marijuana usage or his arrests when he completed a security 
clearance questionnaire. The record evidence is sufficient to mitigate or extenuate the negative security implications stemming from his drug involvement but 
not his deliberate falsifications.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 30, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="02-20596.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On July 27, 2003, 
Applicant's answer to the SOR and request for a hearing was received. On September 1, 2004, I was assigned the case. On September 22, 2004, I convened a 
hearing in this matter. On September 30, 2004, the transcript (tr.) of the hearing was received.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel (DC) moved to amend the SOR, to conform to the evidence presented at the hearing.  DC moved to amend paragraph 1.b. to read, " From 
1996 to at least February 2000." (tr. 58)  DC moved to add paragraph 2.b.2. to read, " On February 26, 1991, you were arrested by the Las Vegas Metropolitan 
Police Department for being under the influence of a controlled substance. You paid a fine." DC moved to amend the SOR to add paragraph 2.c, to read "You 
falsified material facts on a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) executed by you on October 9, 2001, when you responded to question 26, 'Your Police 
Record, Other Offenses. In the last seven years have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 
25'.  To which you answered "no"even though on December 6, 1996, you had been arrested by the Police Department, City of Killeen, Texas on suspicion of 
driving while intoxicated." There being no objection to the amendments, they were granted.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges Drugs Involvement and Personal Conduct. The Applicant admits to the following: he used marijuana from 1982 to 1992, he was arrested in 
1988 and charged with possession of a controlled substance, he was arrested in 1996 for suspicion of Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), when he completed his 
Security Clearance Application, Standard Form (SF) 86, he failed to indicate his illegal drug usage or arrests. Those admissions are incorporated as findings of 
fact. After a thorough review of the whole record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 39 years old, has worked as a photographer for a defense contractor since March 2001 and is seeking a security clearance. The Applicant is 
regarded by those who know him as a reliable, trustworthy professional; a committed partner, loving son, supportive brother, and caring friend. He has 
received excellent work ratings, certificates, letters and coins of appreciation. (App Ex A)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1982, Applicant--then in the 11th grade--first used marijuana. In high school and college he smoked marijuana once or twice a month until 1992 when he 
quit. He stopped because his warehouse job required drug testing. In 1996, he started using again and continued until February 2001. During the more recent 
period of use, he used marijuana once or twice a month.  He has not used marijuana since getting his current job and has no intention of ever using it again. 
Applicant stated he had reached a point in his life where he needed to stop doing negative things. (Tr. 49) Applicant no longer associates with those individuals 
with which he used marijuana. In 1987 or 1988, Applicant got Valium from a friend of his college roommate.  His total use of Valium was limited to two or 
three occasions. He found his Valium use to be very detrimental to his well being. (Gov Ex 2)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In November 1988, Applicant was intoxicated and taken into custody for public intoxication. A search discovered Valium and Applicant was charged with 
possession of a controlled substance.  The charge was dismissed when the arresting officer failed to appear at the court date. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In February 1991, Applicant was arrested for being under the influence of a controlled substance.  He was in a car where marijuana was being smoked when 
the car was stopped by the police. He paid a fine. In February 1994, he was arrested after getting into an argument and breaking his girlfriend's windshield. 
Although he did not appear in court, he paid a fine, court costs, and made restitution.  In July 1995, he received a citation for disorderly conduct noise.  He paid 
a $170 fine.  In December 1996, Applicant was detained for the suspicion of DWI after being stopped for speeding.  He was released when his breathalyzer 
results were .60% and the state minimum for DWI was .80%. He was unaware he had actually been arrested in 1996 until so informed during a May 2002 
Defense Security Service interview.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 1991, Applicant completed his SF 86.  He answered "no" to question 27, which asked him if he had used illegal drugs since age 16 or during the 
previous seven years. He also answered "no" to question 24, which asked him about arrests related to alcohol or drug offenses.  He answered "no" to question 
26, which asked him if during the prior seven years he had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense not previously listed. He intentionally 
falsified his SF 86 because he felt his past transgressions were of minimal security significance.  Additionally, he through his most recent transgression was 
outside the time being considered for his investigation. He now realizes his errors and realizes the seriousness and importance of filling out the forms correctly 
and honestly. (Tr. 55)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the time he completed his SF 86 he understood he needed to fill it out correctly, but at that point in his life, he was more concerned with having gainful 
employment and did not believe anyone would find out about his drug usage or arrests. (Tr. 47)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is an active runner and is active in his church and in Weigh Watchers through which he has lost 50 pounds.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive.  The government has the burden of proving any 
controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts must have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against 
clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">       <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." As 
Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for 
access to classified information to "United States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for 
coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Executive Order 12968, 
<EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines 
contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, then the applicant has the ultimate burden of establishing his security suitability with substantial evidence in 
explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  <EM>See </EM>Executive Orders 10865 &sect; 2 and 12968 &sect; 3.1(b). 
"Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." 
Directive &para; E2.2.2 "The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM> See Egan</EM>, 
484 U.S. at 531.  Doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. Under Guideline H, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when that applicant is involved with illegal drugs. From 1996 through February 2001, Applicant used marijuana once or twice a month. 
He used un-prescribed Valium two or three times in 1988.  Also in 1988 he was charged with possession of a controlled substance (Valium). Disqualifying 
Condition (DC) 1 (E2.A8.1.2.1. Any drug abuse.) applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant last used marijuana in February 2001, just before he started his employment with a defense company.  He started using marijuana in 1982 while in 
high school.  He stopped using in 1992 because his job required drug testing. He resumed using in 1996 and continued until February 2001. He has not used 
marijuana since obtaining his current job. His last usage occurred more than three and a half years ago and is, therefore, not recent. Mitigating Condition (MC) 
1. (E2.A8.1.3.1. The drug involvement was not recent.) applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant stated he had reached a point in his life where he needed to stop doing negative things.  Applicant no longer associates with those individuals with 
which he used marijuana. He has no intention of using it again.  MC 3. (E2.A8.1.3.4. A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.) applies.  I 
find for Applicant as to Drug Involvement. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under guideline E, (Personal Conduct).  Under Guideline E, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when that applicant is shown to have been involved in personal conduct which creates doubt about the person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Complete honesty and candor on the part of applicants for access to classified information is essential to make an accurate and meaningful 
security clearance determination.  Without all the relevant and material facts, a clearance decision is susceptible to error, thus jeopardizing the nation's 
security. The nature of Applicant's actions, in providing false information to multiple questions on his October 2001 SF 86 poses a serious potential risk to the 
nation's security precautions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the time he completed his SF 86 he understood he needed to fill it out correctly, but at that point in his life he was more concerned with having gainful 
employment and did not believe anyone would find out about his drug usage or arrests. Additionally, he believed his past transgressions were of minimal 
security significance and were outside the time being considered for his investigation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant started using marijuana in 1982 and used it until February 2001.  He did not reveal his usage on his October 2001 SF 86. I find against Applicant as 
to SOR 2.a. In 1988, he was arrested for possession of a controlled substance (Valium).  The charge was dismissed.  In 1991, he was arrested for being under 
the influence of a controlled substance and paid a fine.  He failed to listed these arrests on his SF 86.  I find against Applicant as to SOR 2.b.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant knew the truth, but was more worried about getting the job than telling the truth. Because of the serious nature of his falsifications, I find against the 
Applicant as to Personal Conduct, SOR subparagraph 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1996, Applicant was arrested on the suspicion of DWI, but was released without charges when he tested below the legal limit. If an individual is stopped by 
the police and taken to the station it should be revealed on an SF 86. Applicant knew he had been stopped and that charges were dropped, however he was 
unaware he had actually been arrested in 1996 until so informed during a May 2002 Defense Security Service interview.  Not knowing he had been arrested his 
failure to reveal it was not a deliberate falsification. I find for Applicant as to SOR 2.c. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the 
circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P>
