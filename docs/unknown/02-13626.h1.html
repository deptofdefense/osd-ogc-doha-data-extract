<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant </SPAN>has had a long history of financial difficulties, including significant debts for past due Federal and state taxes.  These debts have not been resolved.  
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant knew or should have known that the information that she provided to the Government in a Security Clearance Application (SCA) in 1998, regarding 
her financial situation, was materially incorrect and incomplete.  Mitigation has not been shown.  Clearance is denied.</SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 27, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted or denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated October 14, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and she requested a clearance decision based on a 
hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision on January 15, 2004. A </SPAN>Notice of Hearing<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was issued to 
the parties on February 2, 2004, and the hearing was held on February 26, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered  twenty five documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-25) and no witnesses were called. Applicant appeared without 
counsel, offered two documentary exhibits (Exhibits A and B) and offered her own testimony. All documentary evidence was entered into evidence without 
objection. After the hearing, the record was left open for Applicant to offer additional documentary exhibits regarding her bankruptcy and alleged payment of 
other debts. Applicant failed to offer any additional evidence.  </SPAN>The transcript (TR) was received on<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> March 11, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her Answer, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations (subparagraphs 1.g - 1.m).  Applicant denied the SOR allegations subparagraphs 1.a - 1.f. and  2.a. - 2.c. 
Applicant's admitted allegations are incorporated by reference as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the testimony of Applicant at the hearing, and 
the documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P> Applicant is a 47 year old employee of a defense contractor employee <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">which seeks a security clearance on behalf of Applicant.</SPAN><STRONG> </STRONG>She is separated from her 
current husband, and she has three children.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant owes Federal Income taxes for the tax years 1994 through 2002.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> As of May 1, 1998, she owed $8,868.27, and at that time she received a notice from 
the </SPAN>Internal Revenue Service <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(IRS) that her wages were to be garnished (Exhibit 19). While there is no documentary evidence as to how much, if anything, was 
actually paid to the IRS, Applicant testified that she did pay $1,000 on this debt. She also testified that she owed an additional amount for tax years 1999 
through 2002 (Tr at 30-33).  There is no evidence as to what the total amount is that is now owing in Federal Taxes by Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant owes state income taxes <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">for tax years 1993 through 2002. She owed approximately $21,248.00, but she has begun making payments of $700 a month 
for two months. She currently owes $19,848 (Tr at 26-30, Exhibit A). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 1995, 1996, and 1997 (Exhibits 8, 9, 10). It appeared that all of the bankruptcies were dismissed, and none of 
</SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">'s debts were discharged in bankruptcy. However, Applicant testified at the hearing, that one bankruptcy was completed, and that her debts were 
discharged in bankruptcy (Tr at 34, 35). Despite holding the record open for Applicant to introduce records concerning her completed bankruptcy, no records 
regarding a completed bankruptcy were ever introduced by Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A judgement </SPAN>was issued against Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> in 1997 in the amount of $1,122, for writing checks with insufficient funds. This debt was paid off through a 
garnishment of Applicant's wages by the creditor (Exhibit 22).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was delinquent on a credit card debt in the approximate amount of $1,132. This debt has been settled </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Tr at 35, 36)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was delinquent on a credit card debt in the approximate amount of $647. This debt has been settled </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Tr at 37- 40)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was delinquent on a credit card debt in the approximate amount of $658. This debt has been settled </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Tr at 41- 43)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant completed a signed, sworn <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security Clearance Application (SCA)</SPAN> on November 16, 1998.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question #37 asks,  "In the last 7 years, have you had any judgements against you that have not been paid?" Applicant answered "No" to this question. At the 
time she completed the SCA, </SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was delinquent on a judgement from 1997 in the amount of $1,122, as alleged in 1.e. of the SOR. She should have 
answered "yes" to this question and referred to this judgment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question #38 asks,  "In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?" Applicant answered "No" to this question. At the time she 
completed the SCA, </SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was delinquent on all of the debts discussed above, and she should have answered "yes" to this question and included the debts 
listed in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG></CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question #40 asks,  "In the last 7 years, have you been a party to any public record civil court actions not listed elsewhere on this form?" Applicant answered 
"No" to this question. At the time she completed the SCA, Applicant was delinquent on a judgement from 1997 in the amount of $1,122, as alleged in 1.e. of 
the SOR. Applicant should have answered "yes" either to this question or to question #37 and referred to this judgment.</SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully 
considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2). Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising 
or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>(Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.1. The Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3. Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>(Guideline E - Personal Conduct)<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.1. <EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. The following will normally result in an unfavorable 
clearance action or administrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2. Condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security 
clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3. Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>(Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly establishes Applicant's indebtedness. It shows Applicant has a history 
of financial difficulties. The debts to the Federal and to a state government for past overdue taxes have not been resolved and are still due and owing.  While 
three bankruptcies were filed there is no evidence that any of the overdue  debts were or will be discharged.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to her financial obligations falls within Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A6.1.2.1., and DC 
E2.A6.1.2.3.(A history of not meeting financial obligations, and an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts). I find that no Mitigating Condition (MC) is 
applicable to this case. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant appears to have finally begun to make a good-faith effort to resolve some of her indebtedness. However, since the Applicant's debts to the Federal 
and state governments have not been resolved, I cannot conclude that Applicant's financial problems are behind her. Until her debts are paid, and she can 
establish a record of financial responsibility and stability, security concerns will continue to exist under Guideline F. I resolve Guideline F against Applicant</SPAN>.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>(Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant intentionally provided false material information to the Government in response to 
questions #37, 38, and 40 on the SCA she executed in November 1998. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Additionally, while it was not alleged in the SOR, Question #39 asks, "Are you 
currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt (s)?" Applicant answered "No" to this question. At the time she completed the SCA, Applicant was delinquent on 
all of the debts discussed above, and she should have answered "yes" to this question and included all of the debts listed in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to our nation's secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies 
material facts on a security clearance application, it is extremely difficult to conclude that she nevertheless possesses the judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness required of clearance holders.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.2. </SPAN>applies<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> because the information </SPAN>that Applicant provided in her SCA was known or 
should have been known by her to be <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">omissions and concealment of relevant and material </SPAN>facts.  Applicant did not offer any evidence that could have explained 
the answers she gave on the SCA. No MCs apply.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, Applicant failed to offer any independent evidence indicating that she has reformed and is now reliable and trustworthy. This precludes a finding 
that it is now clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to classified information. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant. </P>
