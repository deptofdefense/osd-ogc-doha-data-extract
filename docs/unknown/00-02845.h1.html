<P>Applicant's extensive history of alcohol abuse is not mitigated where it was punctuated by seven alcohol-related incidents between May 1991 and February 
2002, and where Applicant continues to drink to the point of intoxication. Falsification of his clearance application in April  2000 suggests he cannot be relied 
upon to disclose the truth if it conflicts with his personal interests.  Clearance denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 5 November 2003 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="00-02845.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> recommending denial or 
revocation of Applicant's clearance.  Applicant answered the SOR and requested an administrative decision on the record on 24 November 2003. He did not 
respond to the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM), issued 31 March 2004; the record in this case closed 7 February 2004, the day the response 
was due at DOHA. The case was assigned to me on 19 May 2004 to decide if clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate Applicant's admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 29-year-old munitions handler at a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He has not previously held a clearance</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has an extensive history of alcohol abuse punctuated by seven alcohol-related incidents. He continues to consume alcohol to the point of intoxication.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began abusing alcohol in 1989, when he was 15 years old. In May 1991, his parents took him to a mental health clinic for an alcohol evaluation 
because of their concerns over his alcohol abuse. Between 1989 and May 1999, he regularly drank to the point of intoxication. He claims to have stopped 
drinking altogether between May 1999 and July 2001 after witnessing the automobile death of a close friend who had been drinking with Applicant at a picnic 
in May 1999. He asserts that since July 2001 he drinks a six-pack of beer once or twice a month, and does not drive until he feels he is not under the influence 
of alcohol. He does not believe he needs any alcohol counseling or treatment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has five alcohol-related arrests: October 1993 for battery and minor consuming alcohol, July 1993 for minor consuming alcohol, August 1995 and 
August 1996 for disorderly conduct, and September 1998 for DUI. The police records from these five arrests reveal that Applicant was intoxicated on each of 
these occasions. He did not attend either the victim impact panel or alcohol training as ordered by the court for his 1998 DUI. In addition, in February 2002, 
Applicant was under the influence of alcohol when he hit a car in a bar parking lot and kept going, as he was too intoxicated to notice that he had hit the other 
car.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 25 April 2000, Applicant falsified his clearance application when he disclosed his September 1998 DUI, but did not disclose his other four alcohol-related 
arrests. In his March 2002 sworn statement, he acknowledged that he did not list the other four arrests because he thought it would look bad and keep him from 
getting his clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's supervisor and program director consider him an excellent worker who should have his clearance. Neither indicates any knowledge of Applicant's 
alcohol history.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION (GUIDELINE G)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.1. The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and 
increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.2.1. Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents 
related to alcohol use.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A7.1.2.5. Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2A5.1.1. The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. . . </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2. A5.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts  from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CRIMINAL CONDUCT (GUIDELINE J)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A10.1.1. A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A10.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A10.1.2.1. Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A10.1.2.2. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the 
applicant to establish security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline G. Applicant's history of alcohol abuse is well documented by his multiple alcohol-related incidents 
and his acknowledgment of regular intoxication from 1989 to 1999. However, despite a brief (as related to the total period of alcohol abuse) period of 
abstinence, Applicant resumed drinking in July 2001, and had another alcohol-related incident in February 2002. Nothing in this record suggests that Applicant 
has stopped abusing alcohol or is unlikely to abuse it in the future. I conclude Guideline G against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline E. Applicant clearly omitted four alcohol-related arrests from his clearance application with the intent 
to increase his chances of getting his clearance. I conclude Guideline E against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline J. Applicant's falsifications violate the provisions of 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001, and he has provided 
insufficient mitigation of his conduct. His five alcohol-related arrests in five years cast further doubt on his fitness for access to classified information. I 
conclude Guideline J against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
