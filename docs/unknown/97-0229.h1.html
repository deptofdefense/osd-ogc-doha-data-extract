</P>

<P>	On March 24, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, amended by Change 3, February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,
which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether
clearance </P>

<P>should be denied or revoked. The SOR is attached. Applicant filed his Answer to the SOR on April
18, 1997.</P>

<P>	The case was received by the undersigned on May 23, 1997. A notice of hearing was issued
on May 29, 1997, and the case was heard on June 23, 1997.  The Government and Applicant
submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from Applicant. The transcript was received
on July 7, 1997.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</U></STRONG>Applicant's post-hearing submission is marked and admitted in evidence as Applicant's
Exhibit F. </P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents
and the live testimony. Applicant admitted three out of the four alcohol involvement allegations, but
denied he  continues to consume alcohol. </P>

<P>	Applicant is 39 years old and employed as a computer controller by a defense contractor. He
seeks a secret level clearance. </P>

<P>	According to GE #2, Applicant's consumption of alcohol between 1979 and 1983 occurred
in social settings only. In 1983, his drinking increased while he was on active duty in the military.
From 1983 to approximately 1996, Applicant consumed alcohol about two or three times a week,
either in restaurants or at home. Applicant abstained from drinking from January 1996 to November
1996 and also from December 2, 1996 to January 29, 1997. Applicant consumed three mixed drinks
on January 30, 1997. Although he informed the Government on February 12, 1997, he planned to
control his drinking, he stated at the hearing his last drink of alcohol was on February 29, 1997. </P>

<P>	Applicant was upset over his divorce and became intoxicated on February 20, 1990 (31 years
old) when he was arrested for: (1) driving while under the influence of alcohol; (2) driving with more
than the legal limit of blood alcohol; and, (3) failure to show financial responsibility.<A HREF="97-0229.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> He pled guilty
to having more than the legal limit of alcohol in his blood while driving, and the other two charges
were dismissed. He performed 60 days of community service on the weekends and completed a six
week alcohol program.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	About six years later Applicant became upset over family problems, including his brother's
divorce. He was arrested on January 24, 1996 (when he was 36 years old) for driving while under
the influence of alcohol, and driving with more alcohol in his blood than allowed, with one prior.
He plead guilty to driving with more alcohol in his blood than the legal limit.<A HREF="97-0229.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> He was ordered to
complete a 60 day work furlough program. After 29 days, he was released because of good behavior.
He was also sentenced to three years probation and will not complete the probation until April 1999.
His license was restricted for 18 months for work purposes only. The restriction will not be lifted
until October 1997, when Applicant is scheduled to complete an 18 month court-ordered treatment 
program. He started the treatment program in July 1996 and, on the advice of his counselor, began
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) on February 4, 1997, because his counselor believed he should abstain
from any alcohol use.<A HREF="97-0229.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> Applicant has been in group/individual counseling since July 1996. He has
only accomplished Step One of the 12 Steps (realizing that his life has become unmanageable and
that he is powerless over alcohol) of AA since February 1997 and still has no sponsor because other
AA members have told him that he should find a sponsor and locate a home group he is totally
comfortable with before committing undivided effort to the Steps. (TR. 59)  While in counseling,
he has also followed his counselor's suggestion by increasing his physical activity during the few
weak moments he has encountered. (TR. 59-60)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Seven character references, who have known Applicant for up to five years, consider him
competent, honest and reliable. Applicant is current on two department store accounts and also his
mortgage. Recent medical tests reveal Applicant has normal kidney and liver function. On June 27,
1997, the program director noted Applicant was making good progress in the program with a
recommendation to complete the program and continue to make changes in his lifestyle to support
sobriety. Applicant's positive progress report, containing a good prognosis, and his favorable
credibility, justifies a finding Applicant will continue to make adjustments to support a lifestyle
conducive to sobriety.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth policy factors which must be given binding
consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors must be considered in
every case according to the pertinent criterion; however, the factors are in no way <U>automatically</U>
<U>determinative</U> of the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance
on his own common sense. Because each security case presents its own unique facts and
circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the entire realm of human
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. In addition, the Judge, as the trier of fact,
must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Factors most pertinent to evaluation
of the facts in this case are:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><CENTER><STRONG>Excessive Alcohol Consumption (Criterion G)</CENTER>
</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT SIZE="-1">Factors Against Clearance</U>:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	1. Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	5. Consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed
medical professional and following completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program. </FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT SIZE="-1">Factors for Clearance</U>:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	3. positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	4. Following diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, the individual has
successfully completed inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with aftercare requirements,
participates frequently in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or similar organization, abstained from
alcohol for a period of at least 12 months, and received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed
medical professional. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">			<STRONG><CENTER>General Policy Factors (Whole Person Concept)</CENTER>
</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1">	</STRONG>Every security clearance case must also be evaluated under additional policy factors that
make up the whole person concept. Those factors (found at page 2-1 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive)
include: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the
conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the
time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; and, (8) the
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	As set forth in the Directive, every personnel security determination must be a fair and
impartial overall commonsense decision based upon all available information, both favorable and
unfavorable, and must be arrived at by applying the standard that the granting (or continuance) of
a security clearance under this Directive may only be done upon a finding that to do so is clearly
consistent with the national interest. In reaching determinations under the Directive, careful
consideration must be directed to the actual as well as the potential risk involved that an applicant
may fail to properly safeguard classified information in the future. The Administrative Judge can
only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence
of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative
or conjectural in nature.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	The Government must establish all the factual allegations under Criterion G (excessive
alcohol consumption) which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and
trustworthiness. While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's
adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to the
sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Then, the applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,
explanation, mitigation or extenuation which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely
to repeat itself and Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><CENTER><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	The Government has established excessive alcohol consumption from approximately 1983
when Applicant joined the military to January 1996 when Applicant was arrested in January 1996
for have more alcohol in his blood than allowed by law. In addition to Applicant's documented
convictions for alcohol-related offenses in 1990 and January 1996, Applicant could have been
justifiably prosecuted for driving under the influence on 10 other occasions. Finally, Applicant's
participation in counseling since July 1996 and his abstinence since February 29, 1997 must be
weighed and balanced against the simple facts his driving restriction will not be lifted until October
1997 and he will not be discharged from probation until April 1999. He is aware that any violation
of probation could mean serving the balance of his work furlough or even incarceration for a
significant period of time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	However, I conclude that the strong court sentence in Applicant's most recent alcohol-related
conviction has represented a "wake-up" call for Applicant. Applicant has demonstrated good
judgment by obeying all conditions of probation, particularly conditions of all treatment. Even
though he does not have a sponsor yet and has only accomplished Step One of the 12 Step Program,
his demeanor and conduct at the hearing indicates he is definitely committed to completing the
treatment programs and intensifying his commitment to AA and the Step program. Important in
Applicant's recovery has been his willingness to utilize the advice of his counselor. For example,
upon his counselor's recommendation, Applicant joined AA on a permanent basis in February 1997
to increase his overall therapeutic regimen. When he was experiencing a few weak moments with
an urge to consume alcohol, Applicant, on the advice of his counselor, increased his exercise
regimen.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Applicant's favorable treatment report of June 27, 1997, his compliance with court-ordered
probation terms, and the favorable character evidence of Applicant's good judgment on the job,
convince me that Applicant's commitment to recovery will be as strong after he is released from
probation as his recovery effort has been since July 1996.</FONT></P>
