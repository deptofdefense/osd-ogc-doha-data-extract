<P>Although applicant's criminal activity is not recent, his failure to offer any credible evidence from independent sources indicating that he is now reliable and 
trustworthy precludes a finding that he has reformed. Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On September 23,  2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant 
and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P>Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 2, 2002, and elected to have his case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department 
Counsel submitted the Government's written case on or about December 6, 2002. Applicant did not file a response to the Government's written case. The case 
was assigned to me on January 14, 2003.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is forty-two years of age.</P> 
<P>In 1979, applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Theft, 2<SUP>nd</SUP> degree and (2) Taking a Motor Vehicle Without Permission of Owner. Both offenses were 
felonies. He was convicted of both charges and sentenced to five years in prison. Applicant was paroled on two occasions, but each time his parole was revoked 
for violations of his parole conditions.</P> 
<P>In 1995, applicant received an Article 15 for Falsifying an Official Statement, Fraudulent Enlistment. The charges were based on applicant's failure to disclose 
his arrest record on his enlistment papers when he joined the Army in 1994. He was given seven days of extra duty, a reduction in rank (suspended), and was 
ordered to forfeit seven days pay (suspended). In a signed, sworn statement that he gave to the Defense Security Service (DSS) in February 2001 (Exhibit 8), 
applicant stated that he had informed his recruiter of the arrests and was told that since they were not documented, he did not have to list them on his 
recruitment papers. In the Army investigative records (Exhibit 6), however, the recruiter stated that applicant never told him about the arrests. Based on the 
punishment applicant received, it is apparent the Army did not believe applicant.</P> 
<P>In the February 2001 statement to the DSS, applicant stated the following:</P> 
<P>I would like to state that when I was a teenager, I was getting myself into problems and not being a good citizen. For the past twenty years I have had no 
additional problems with police activity.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth Guidelines (divided into conditions that could raise security concerns and conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns) which must be followed by the Administrative Judge. Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the following Guidelines are applicable:</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Disqualifying Conditions</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>1. E2.A10.1.2.1: Criminal conduct.</P> 
<P>2. E2.A10.1.2.2: A single serious crime or multiple lessor offenses.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Mitigating Conditions</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>1. E2.A10.1.3.1: The criminal behavior was not recent.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>The evidence establishes that in 1979, applicant was convicted of two felonies and sentenced to five years in prison. The evidence further establishes that in 
1994, applicant falsified his Army enlistment papers by not disclosing his prior arrests, and that as a result, he received an Article 15. Applicant's criminal and 
dishonest conduct reflects adversely on his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness, and strongly suggests that he cannot be relied upon to safeguard classified 
information.</P> 
<P>Applicant failed to establish that he has reformed. Although the passage of time since applicant engaged in the criminal conduct (the felonious conduct occurred 
over twenty years ago and the Article 15 occurred approximately eight years ago) is a mitigating factor, applicant's failure to offer any credible evidence from 
any independent sources (e.g., family, coworkers, supervisors, friends) indicating that he is now a reliable and trustworthy person precludes a finding that he 
now possesses the good judgement, reliability and trustworthiness required of individuals with access to classified  information.</P>

<P>PARAGRAPH 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for applicant.</P>
