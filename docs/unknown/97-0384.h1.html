</P>

<P>	On May 29, 1997<A NAME="SOR's date"></A>, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January
2, 1992 (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and recommended
referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,
denied, or revoked.  In a sworn written but undated statement the Applicant responded to the
allegations set forth in the SOR and elected to have his case decided on a written record, in lieu of
a hearing .  A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and incorporated herein by reference.</P>

<P>	The Applicant received a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) on July 9,
1997.  The Applicant also received an opportunity then to file objections and submit material in
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  The Applicant elected not to respond to the FORM within the
requisite 30 days, <EM><STRONG>i.e.</STRONG></EM>, on or before August 8, 1997.  The record in this case closed on August 8,
1997.  The undersigned Administrative Judge received the case assignment on August 18, 1997.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on a single criterion:
paragraph 1, Criterion J (criminal conduct).  The Applicant has admitted the factual allegations
contained in both subparagraphs of the SOR.  Except as noted herein, the Applicant's admissions are
hereby incorporated as findings of fact.</P>

<P>	The undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly reviewed the evidence in
the record, and upon due consideration of the same, makes the following additional Findings of Fact:</P>

<P>	The Applicant is a 36-year-old audiovisual specialist employed by a U.S. Government
contractor since June 1996.  The Applicant seeks to obtain a personnel security clearance.</P>

<P>	The Applicant was hired by company X, a discount appliance retailer, in August 1992 as a
management trainee.  A year later he became an Assistant Manager, serving as an inventory manager
for company X.  That company fired him in November 1995 when it discovered that he had been
stealing merchandise from them for two months.  During that two-month period he had stolen two
camcorders, a tripod, five compact disks, and a briefcase worth $1,945 in total.  He was arrested on
November 7, 1995, and charged with felony theft (class 3).  He was admitted to the deferred
prosecution program, and the charge was dismissed by the prosecution upon payment of $300 for
admission into the program and payment of full restitution to company X.  He was placed on one
year's probation.</P>

<P>	The Applicant explained in a sworn statement (FORM item 5) given on February 27, 1997,
to a Defense Investigative Service (DIS) agent that he did not get along with a new manager who
had been appointed in August 1995 and that he felt he was going to lose his job.  The Applicant
consequently felt "vindictive" and "bitter" and felt that "the store owed [him] something."</P>

<P>	On March 12, 1996, while on probation, the Applicant was arrested in an adjacent state on
a misdemeanor charge of Operating a vehicle While Intoxicated (OWI).  His blood alcohol content
(BAC) was tested at 0.249% shortly after he was involved in a one-car accident and was
hospitalized.  He pleaded guilty and was required to pay the minimum fine of $500 plus costs.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative
guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  The guidelines
are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or revoke a clearance
(Disqualifying Conditions or DC) and those that may be considered in determining whether to grant
or continue an individual's access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions or MC).  In
evaluating this case, relevant adjudicative guidelines as set forth below have been carefully con-sidered as the most pertinent to the facts of this particular case.</P>

<P>	The criteria, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating conditions most pertinent to an
evaluation of the facts of this case are:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>CRITERION J - CRIMINAL CONDUCT</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>		A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a
person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>		Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be
disqualifying include: </STRONG></P>

<P>			  (1)	any criminal conduct, regardless of
whether the person was formally
charged; </P>

<P>			  (2)	a single serious crime or multiple
lesser offenses.</P>

<P>		<STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></P>

<P>			  (2)	the crime was an isolated incident;</P>

<P>	The Directive also requires the undersigned to consider, as appropriate, the factors
enumerated in Section F.3:</P>

<P>		a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</P>

<P>		b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P>

<P>		c. Age of the applicant.</P>

<P>		d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct
was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of
the consequences involved.</P>

<P>		e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P>

<P>		f. Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur
in the future.</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 to the Directive provides that the adjudicator should consider the following
factors:</P>

<P>		The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</P>

<P>		The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include
knowledgeable participation</P>

<P>		The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<P>		The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<P>		The voluntariness of participation</P>

<P>		The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent
behavioral changes</P>

<P>		The motivation for the conduct</P>

<P>		The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</P>

<P>		The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</P>

<P>	Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision
to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding
that to do so is <U>clearly consistent</U> with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall
common sense determination required, the Administrative Judge may only draw those inferences
and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  Determinations
under the Directive include consideration of the risk that an applicant may deliberately or
inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information as that term is defined and established
under Executive Order 12958, effective on October 14, 1995.</P>

<P>	Initially, the Government has the burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme Court has said:</P>

<P>		It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence
standard without departing from the 'clearly consistent with the
interests of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard
indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they
must, on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government
to support the denial [of a security clearance] by a preponderance of
the evidence would inevitably shift the emphasis and involve the
Board in second-guessing the agency's national security
determinations.</P>

<P> <EM>Dept. of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that
Supreme Court guidance in its context to go to the minimum <STRONG><EM>quantum</EM></STRONG> of the admissible evidence
that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its case, that is, substantial
evidence but something less than a preponderance of the evidence -- rather than as an indication of
the Court's tolerance for error below.<A HREF="97-0384.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the applicant for the purpose
of establishing his or her security eligibility through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation
of the Government's case or through evidence of affirmative defenses.  Assuming the Government's
case is not refuted, and further assuming it can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an
applicant might deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information, the
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he or she is nonetheless eligible to hold
a security clearance.<A HREF="97-0384.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, the undersigned concludes that the Government established its case with regard to Criterion
J.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Applicant's pattern of multiple thefts during two months of 1995 constitute serious
criminal behavior that was recent, voluntary, and willful.  They cannot be excused as "isolated," or
"not recent," or the acts of a juvenile, or committed under extenuating circumstances.  They fall
within the scope of DC #1 and DC #2, identified on page 3 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  No mitigating evidence has been
submitted. SOR &para; 1.a. is concluded adversely to the Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	On the other hand, the OWI conduct, while criminal, does not form part of a pattern of
criminal behavior or otherwise shares significant common attributes with the felony thefts.  The
Applicant's particular OWI behavior was not especially serious conduct--although serious con-sequences may ensue in general from OWIs and his BAC was extraordinarily high.  As such, the
OWI was an isolated criminal incident and mitigated.  Therefore, SOR &para; 1.b. is concluded favorably
to the Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P>	Each case decision is required to consider, as appropriate, the factors listed in Section F.3 and
enclosure 2 to the Directive.  Those factors are identified on pages 3-4 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  The nature of the
thefts was planned, voluntary, and deliberate.  The amount of the property stolen was significant. 
The thefts occurred as recently as within the last two years and at a time when the Applicant was of
mature age and in a position of trust.  Little evidence of rehabilitation is available in the record.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Formal findings as required by Enclosure 1 of the Directive (see paragraph (7) of section 3
of Executive Order 10865, as amended) and the additional procedural guidance contained in item
25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</P>

<P>Paragraph 1. Criterion J:					AGAINST APPLICANT</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	Subparagraph 1.a.:					Against Applicant</P>

<P>	Subparagraph 1.b.:					For Applicant</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>DECISION</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is the determination
of the undersigned that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for the Applicant.</P>
