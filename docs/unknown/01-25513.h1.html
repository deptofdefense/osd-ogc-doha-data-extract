<P>Although Applicant surrendered her Egyptian passport in compliance with the Money Memorandum, her demonstrated foreign preference was not mitigated 
where Applicant had maintained her Egyptian passport since acquiring U.S. citizenship in 1986 and had used it to obtain hotel and airline discounts in Egypt 
and to ensure that she could enter Egypt without having to obtain a visa. In addition, she returned to Egypt for vacation and to visit relatives nearly every year 
from 1972 to 1987 and seventeen times in the sixteen years since she became a U.S. citizen. Finally, she was subject to potential foreign influence where her

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 15 October 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-25513.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 10 
December 2002, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was originally assigned to a different Administrative Judge, but was reassigned 
to me on 12 February 2003, and received the same day. I issued a notice of hearing on 14 March 2003 for a hearing on 9 April 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   At the hearing, the Government presented two exhibits--admitted without objection--and no witnesses; Applicant presented six exhibits--five admitted 
without objection, one over objection--and the testimony of two witnesses, including herself. DOHA received the transcript on 17 April 2003.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel requested that I take official notice of the State Department web page Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2002 
pertaining to Egypt and the State Department list of terrorist organizations. Applicant's counsel requested I take official notice of related State Department web 
sites pertaining to Egypt. I granted both requests.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the foreign preference and foreign influence allegations of the SOR; accordingly I incorporate those admissions as findings of fact. She 
denied falsifying her clearance application.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor--seeks to retain the access she has had with this employer since 1990.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Egypt in 1944. She grew up and was educated there, obtaining a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from a state university in 
1966.  She began pursuing her master's degree in electrical engineering at that same university in 1966 and was employed as a teaching assistant. She married 
an Egyptian citizen in 1967 and had a son in 1970. She obtained her master's degree in 1972.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1972--when Applicant was 27--she obtained a full scholarship to pursue her doctorate in electrical engineering at a major state university in the U.S., and 
came to the U.S. on a student visa along with her husband and son. She obtained her doctorate in 1976. She also had a second son in 1976.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1978, Applicant became a legal permanent resident of the U.S. having decided that she wanted to become a citizen. She had a third son in 1981. She became 
a U.S. citizen in September 1986.<A HREF="01-25513.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> She obtained her first U.S. passport in January 1987, and renewed it in December 1996.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Until November 2002, Applicant possessed an Egyptian passport, issued in December 1994, that would not have expired until December 2004. She had 
maintained her Egyptian passport since coming to the U.S. in 1972. Between 1972 and approximately 1987 (the first 15 years she was in the  U.S.), she returned 
to Egypt every 12-18 months (Tr. 71) using her Egyptian passport--the only one she was entitled to have. She first used her U.S. passport to return to Egypt in 
July 1987 (A.E. E). Since that time, her U.S. passports (A.E. D, E.), her 1990 clearance application (part of her answer), her sworn statement (G.E. 2), and her 
Answer document that she has returned to Egypt 17 times for periods varying between 3-5 weeks:<A HREF="01-25513.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> July 1987, July 1988, July 1989, December 1990, June 
1992, August 1993, December 1994, July 1995, December 1996, August 1997, November 1998, July 1999, December 2000, June 2001, June 2002, and 
December 2002. Although she always traveled to Egypt <STRONG>on</STRONG> her U.S. passport, she always (except in December 2002) traveled <STRONG>with </STRONG>her Egyptian passport. She 
did so to ensure that she could enter Egypt without a visa if immigration officials required one for her to use her U.S. passport,<A HREF="01-25513.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> as a means of identification 
while in Egypt, and as a means of qualifying for hotel discounts and air travel discounts<A HREF="01-25513.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> that are not available to non-Egyptians. She travels to Egypt primarily 
for vacation. However, she also visits her brother and two sisters who live in Egypt. She also visited her mother until her death in 1995.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant surrendered her Egyptian passport to the Egyptian Embassy after she received the SOR and became aware of the security significance of her retention 
of the passport.<A HREF="01-25513.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> She has expressed a willingness to renounce her Egyptian citizenship, but has not proceeded beyond inquiring how to do it.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has three siblings, a brother and two sisters, who are Egyptian citizens, residing in Egypt. The two sisters are retired government workers. One 
worked as a professor at a state university. The other worked in state television. The brother sells insurance. When Applicant is in Egypt, she typically visits her 
siblings about once a week, but does not stay with them. She calls them every month or so. She describes these contacts as "casual."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 2000, Applicant and her siblings inherited about 10 acres of agricultural land from their mother's estate. The land generates about $200.00 for Applicant 
annually, an amount she has her brother (who manages the property) donate to charity. With fluctuations in the Egyptian economy, Applicant has estimated the 
value of her share of the property at between $12,000.00 and $20,000.00. Neither figure is significant as a percentage (.8%/1.3%) of her real estate holdings and  
retirement accounts in the U.S. ($1,570,000.00), which do not include the value of her husband's retirement accounts or their other cash accounts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 11 November 1999, Applicant falsified a Security Clearance Application<A HREF="01-25513.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> (SCA)(SF 86)(G.E. 1) when she disclosed her travel to Egypt in November 1998 
and August 1999, but omitted her travel to Egypt in August 1993, December 1994, July 1995, December 1996, and August 1997.<A HREF="01-25513.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Applicant variously claims 
that she found the computer-based clearance application confusing and that she read the question to call for disclosure of trips within the last two years, not 
seven.<A HREF="01-25513.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> However, she did not falsify her clearance application by failing to disclose her property ownership, because, while her mother died in 1995, the estate 
had not completed probate and ownership of the 10 acres had not yet vested in Applicant and her siblings. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Egypt has a questionable human rights record, in the view of the State Department, because of its actions against terrorist groups. However, the Government 
submitted no evidence to show that Applicant's siblings are directly or indirectly affected by this fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is an exemplary employee of her company. Her friends, supervisor, and coworkers consider her a loyal American. She has had no security violations 
in the period of time she has held a clearance. She and her family have embraced the American dream of property and participation. She votes in U.S. elections. 
Other than I have described above, she has not exercised any right of her Egyptian citizenship.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the 
applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an applicant's 
fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the 
disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. 
Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of 
persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 
U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been a dual citizen of Egypt and the United States since her naturalization in 1986. Ordinarily, an applicant's foreign citizenship possesses little 
security significance if based solely on her birth in a foreign country. For Applicant's conduct to fall within the security concerns of Guideline C, Foreign 
Preference, she must have acted in a way to indicate a preference for a foreign nation over the United States. However, inimical intent or detrimental impact on 
the interests of the United States is not required before the Government can seek to deny access under Guideline C. The Government has a compelling interest 
in ensuring those entrusted with this Nation's secrets will make decisions free of concerns for the foreign country of which they may also be a citizen. Under 
this assessment, I conclude the Government has established its case under Guideline C.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant claims to prefer her U.S. citizenship to her foreign citizenship, her conduct belies that assertion. Applicant is clearly proud of her U.S. 
citizenship, but she has maintained significant aspects of her foreign citizenship. While her oath of allegiance to the U.S. and her rejection of allegiance to any 
foreign government in the citizenship oath is powerful evidence of a preference for U.S. citizenship, the citizenship oath does not automatically operate to 
terminate her citizenship rights in Egypt. The fact that Egypt may still consider her a citizen would ordinarily not affect the analysis of Applicant's preference. 
However, in this case Applicant reasserted her foreign citizenship and her preference for that citizenship by maintaining possession of, and renewing, her 
Egyptian passport, and using it both to obtain discounts not available to non-Egyptians, but to ensure that she would be treated as an Egyptian citizen if the need 
arose while in Egypt--a sort of insurance. The fact that she always used her U.S. passport to travel overseas does not mitigate the security significance of the 
fact that she traveled to Egypt with her Egyptian passport as backup.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A citizen of any country, including the U.S., who travels to another country, submits to the sovereignty of that country, including application of its laws 
regarding visits by foreign citizens. However, a citizen of the U.S. who travels abroad only as a U.S. citizen, travels with the knowledge that the U.S. 
Government is available to provide diplomatic assistance if the traveler encounters difficulty. A dual citizen of the U.S. and a foreign state who travels to that 
foreign state faces potential difficulty in obtaining U.S. diplomatic assistance because the foreign state may insist on treating the traveler as its own citizen, even 
where the entry document used is the U.S. passport.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding possession and use of her foreign passport, Applicant meets none of the mitigating conditions (MC) for foreign preference.<A HREF="01-25513.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Her dual citizenship is 
not based merely on her birth in a foreign country, but on her active assertion of her citizenship rights in that country. Applicant's voluntary assertion of her 
foreign citizenship rights occurred after she became a naturalized  U.S. citizen. Although her conduct is lawful, there is no evidence that the conduct was 
formally sanctioned by the United States. Applicant has expressed a willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship, but has taken no steps to pursue that 
option, and had no interest in doing so until her clearance became an issue.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I Memorandum provides only partial relief for Applicant. The Memorandum states that Applicant's past possession and use of her foreign passport 
can be mitigated only if Applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains U.S. Government approval for its use. Applicant has surrendered her Egyptian 
passport. Her doing so confirms my conclusion that Applicant is a law abiding citizen, but does not end the inquiry into the security significance of her conduct. 
Put another way, compliance with Money Memorandum is a necessary, but not necessarily sufficient, condition for mitigating her possession and use of her 
foreign passport. Further, the presence or absence of any one disqualifying or mitigating factor is not determinative of a case. I must still consider the 
circumstances of Applicant's conduct and determine whether that conduct demonstrates unacceptable foreign preference notwithstanding the surrender of the 
foreign passport.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case, Applicant appears to have begun expressing some preference for her Egyptian citizenship shortly after her U.S. naturalization, when she returned to 
Egypt for the first of 17 trips since becoming a U.S. citizen. She took her Egyptian passport, for the reasons described above, and renewed it in 1994 so she 
could continue to use it for those purposes. Presumably, she would have continued to renew if for those purposes but for the Money Memorandum. That 
Applicant engaged in this conduct, all otherwise lawful, in ignorance of the security implications of the conduct is beside the point. Although the Money 
emorandum postdates some of Applicant's conduct, the adjudicative guidelines for foreign preference have remained essentially unchanged since before 
Applicant became a U.S. citizen. Yet even the constancy of the guidelines is somewhat beside the point. To a certain extent, foreign preference is best measured 
by observing an Applicant's legal conduct without regard to administrative regulations or other limitations. This is because foreign preference is to be expected 
in a nation of immigrants. It is natural to have a certain affection for the land of one's birth and for one's adopted homeland. It is even to be expected that one 
will return to the land of one's birth to visit relatives, to show the old country to your children, even to vacation occasionally. But Applicant's has returned to 
Egypt nearly annually since first coming to the U.S. in 1972--seventeen times since becoming a U.S. citizen. I do not doubt Applicant's loyalty and devotion to 
the U.S., but I cannot ignore that Applicant has maintained close and continuing contact with her native land. She goes "home" on vacation and visits family. 
This conduct, aided by her maintenance of her Egyptian passport, demonstrates an unacceptable division in her national preference. I resolve Guideline C 
against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a similar fashion, Applicant appears vulnerable to foreign influence. Applicant's property interest is insignificant in comparison to her U.S. assets, and 
provides no point of leverage. Nor is Applicant vulnerable because of the human rights situation in Egypt regarding pursuit of known terrorist groups. None of 
Applicant's siblings appear to have been employed in any position that would increase Applicant's potential vulnerability. Nevertheless, Applicant's contacts 
with her siblings are best described as close and continuing.  Notwithstanding Applicant's representations that none of her family are agents of a foreign 
government, the record contains insufficient information about her family members to conclude that they do not constitute an unacceptable security risk as 
required by MC 1, particularly where I have concluded that Applicant has a preference for Egypt in the first place. I resolve Guideline B against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline E regarding Applicant's omission of five trips to Egypt from her clearance application. However, I 
conclude that Applicant could not have reported her property interest not yet vested. Nor would that expectancy create a financial interest required to be 
reported. But Applicant knew she had several more trips to Egypt than she reported. While Applicant later disclosed those trips to the Government, her conduct 
suggests she is willing to put her personal needs ahead of legitimate Government interests. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated  2 January 1992--amended by Change 3 dated 16 
February 1996 and by Change 4 dated 20 April 1999 (Directive). 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Applicant's husband became a U.S. citizen in 1995; her first son became a U.S. in approximately 1988, when he turned 18. Both are dual citizens. Her other 
two sons are U.S. citizens by birth; they may be, or eligible to become, Egyptian citizens by derivation. However, neither has pursued Egyptian citizenship. 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>Not including some multiple entries when she traveled outside Egypt and returned after short visits to other countries. 
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>Which they apparently did not. 
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>On the state-owned domestic airlines. 
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A>In compliance with the Money Memorandum, discussed below. 
<P><A NAME="N_7_">7. </A>Mis-alleged in the SOR as a "Questionnaire for National Security Positions," an earlier version of SF 86. 
<P><A NAME="N_8_">8. </A>The SOR incorrectly alleged  failure to report travel in June 1992, a period outside the reporting requirement (7 years) of question 16. The SOR also 
incorrectly alleged the December 1996 travel as occurring in August 1996, and did not include the August 1993 travel in the list of omitted travel. 
<P><A NAME="N_9_">9. </A>I have considered these claims, as well as the fact that she did disclose the two most recent trips to Egypt and  disclosed all her foreign travel in her 1990 
clearance application (on a form that required disclosure of all travel, regardless of date). I conclude they are not credible for a number of reasons. Applicant is 
an electrical engineer, a discipline requiring precision. She is employed as a network and communications engineer.  Applicant's security applications reflect 
that precision. Indeed, she did not disclose her  pending inheritance because it was not yet vested--a precise and correct interpretation. I do not believe she had 
trouble with a computer-based application or read the question to require disclosure of only the last two years. The foreign contacts questions, as many of the 
other questions on the application, require disclosure of information for the last seven years. Some questions require disclosure of 10 years' information. Some 
require disclosure of any incident--as did Applicant's 1990 application regarding foreign travel. None of the questions has a two-year limitation. 
<P><A NAME="N_10_">10. </A>During the proceeding this document was sometimes referred to as the Money Memorandum because it is signed by Assistant Secretary Arthur L. Money. 
<P><A NAME="N_11_">11. </A>Of course, any conduct Applicant engaged in as an Egyptian citizen before becoming a U.S. citizen--such as obtaining her education there before coming to 
the U.S.--may be considered mitigated as occurring before her naturalization.</SPAN></P>
