<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant </SPAN>has had a long history of financial difficulties, including significant debts for past due Federal taxes, and the filing of two bankruptcies.  The majority 
of these debts have not been resolved.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant knew or should have known that the information that she provided to the Government in a Security Clearance

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 7, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted or denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed, sworn statement, dated August 2, 2004, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and she requested a clearance decision based on a hearing 
record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision on October 12, 2004. A </SPAN>Notice of Hearing<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was issued to 
the parties on October 19, 2004, and the hearing was held on November 3, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered fifteen documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-15) and no witnesses were called. Applicant appeared without counsel, 
offered 9 documentary exhibits (Exhibits A through I) and offered her own testimony. All documentary evidence was entered into evidence without objection. 
After the hearing, the record was left open for Applicant to offer additional documentary exhibits regarding her bankruptcy and alleged payment of other debts. 
Applicant offered additional timely documents, which have been marked collectively as Exhibit J. This final exhibit was not objected to by Department Counsel 
and has been entered into evidence.  </SPAN>The transcript (TR) was received on<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> November 17, 2004. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) of the Directive. The SOR contains twenty three allegations, 1.a. through 1.w., under Guideline F and 2 allegations, 2.a. and 2.b., under Guideline E. 
In her Response to the SOR (RSOR), Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except: 1.a., 1.b.,1.m., 2.a.,  and 2.b. The admitted allegations are 
incorporated herein as a Findings of Fact. </SPAN></P>

debt. Exhibit H shows an SCA completed by Applicant on March 7, 2000, where the answer "No" was crossed out and "Yes" was checked regarding debts

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully 
considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2). Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising 
or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>(Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly establishes Applicant's indebtedness. It shows Applicant has a long 
history of financial difficulties. The debts to the Federal government for past overdue taxes have not been resolved and are still due and owing.  Applicant  filed 
two bankruptcies in the past, because of financial difficulties, and there is no evidence that Applicant has learned how to handle her finances now any better 
than she did in the past. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to her financial obligations falls within Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A6.1.2.1., and DC 
E2.A6.1.2.3.(A history of not meeting financial obligations, and an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts). I find that no Mitigating Condition (MC) is 
applicable to this case. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Until Applicant makes a good-faith effort to resolve her debts, and she can establish a record of financial responsibility and stability, security concerns will 
continue to exist under Guideline F. I resolve Guideline F against Applicant</SPAN>.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>(Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant intentionally provided false material information to the Government in response to 
questions # 38, and #39 on the SCA she executed on March 7, 2000.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant was delinquent on the debts discussed above, and she should have answered 
"yes" to theses questions and included on her SCA all of the debts listed in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to our nation's secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies 
material facts on a security clearance application, it is extremely difficult to conclude that she nevertheless possesses the judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness required of clearance holders.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.2. </SPAN>applies<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> because the information </SPAN>that Applicant provided in her SCA was known or 
should have been known by her to be <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">omissions and concealment of relevant and material </SPAN>facts.  Applicant did not offer any evidence that could have explained 
the answers she gave on the SCA. No MCs apply.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, Applicant failed to offer any independent evidence indicating that she has reformed and is now reliable and trustworthy. This precludes a finding 
that it is now clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to classified information. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant. </P>
