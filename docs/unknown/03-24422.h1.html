<P>Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection on numerous occasions, presently has more than $25,000.00 in delinquent debt, has numerous alcohol-related 
incidents in his background, and failed to disclose most of this information in a security clearance application he submitted in February 2000. Clearance is 
denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On December 17, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-24422.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations), Guideline G (alcohol consumption), Guideline E (personal conduct), and 
Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant submitted an undated response to the SOR and requested a clearance decision based on the written record without a 
hearing. Applicant admitted all SOR allegations except subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c., 1.i., 2.a., 3.a. through 3.d., and 4.a.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on May 9, 2005, that was mailed to Applicant May 10, 2005, and received by him on May 
23, 2005. Applicant did not object to anything contained in the FORM or submit additional information for consideration within the 30-day period provided to 
him. The case was assigned to me July 18, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL MATTERS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to delete subparagraph 1.i., alleging it was a duplication of the allegation contained in subparagraph 1.h., and to 
amend the date alleged in subparagraph 2.i. to September 8, 1984, vice September 8, 1985. There being no objection to the motion by Applicant, the motion is 
granted.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the various SOR allegations are incorporated herein. Additionally, after a thorough review of the record, I make the following 
findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 62-year-old man who has been employed by a defense contractor as a security specialist since July 1982. He served in the U.S. Navy Reserve 
from June 1960 until July 1961, and attained the rank of Seaman (paygrade E-3). He enlisted in the U.S. Army in July 1961, served on active duty until July 
1964, and attained the rank of Private First Class (paygrade E-3). He attended college and obtained an associate's degree in 1982. He has been married since 
July 1967, and has four adult children. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a single letter of recommendation signed by both the manager, industrial security/site emergency coordinator and the director, 
security/ethics/facility security officer of his employer. These individuals indicate that Applicant is a competent, reliable, loyal, and a dedicated employee. They 
are aware of the financial and alcohol allegations contained in the SOR, but state those problems never affected Applicant's work performance. They have 
never detected any sign that alcohol consumption has affected his work performance, and they have never smelled alcohol on his breath or detected signs he 
was under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection in 1969, 1974, 1976, 1988, and 1996. He obtained discharges in each of those actions, except the 1974 filing which 
was dismissed for an unknown reason. He presently has outstanding one judgment, one past-due account, six accounts charged off as bad debts, six collection 
accounts, and one deficiency following repossession on an automobile. The total owing on these accounts is $25,612.00. Applicant provided a number of 
explanations why these delinquent accounts were incurred; claiming that many of them resulted from his cosigning on loans for his children or were directly 
incurred by his children on accounts in his name. He attributes the auto repossession to his voluntary surrender of the vehicle because of  problems he had with 
the used vehicle he purchased and his inability to obtain relief under the state "Lemon Law." He failed to provide any information on any plan to resolve any of 
the debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was charged with either Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) or Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) in 1964, 1974, 1976, 1984, 1985, and 
1999. He was convicted of each of those offenses or a negotiated reduced charge to the offense. He received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, Uniform 
Code of Military Justice, in 1962 for being intoxicated while on duty. He committed  a domestic battery and resisted a police officer in January 1997 after 
consuming alcohol. He committed a criminal damage to property in October 1998 by damaging vehicle tires on cars of people he had gotten into an argument 
within a bar where he had been drinking. He was convicted of the domestic battery and criminal damage to property charges.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant received alcohol treatment from December 4-27, 1974, July 22 until October 6, 1997, and intensive outpatient treatment from December 11, 1999 
until February 17, 2000. He has not consumed alcohol since 1999, and now attends alcoholics anonymous (AA) meetings two to three times a week. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) in February 2000 in which he failed to list his alcoho- related offenses except the 1999 DUI, and 
the alcohol-related treatment he received in 1997 and 1990-2000. He also failed to disclose any of his many delinquent accounts. His first explanation for not 
disclosing the information is that he told the agent who interviewed him following his submission of the SF 86 about them and it is the agent's fault because he 
didn't do his job properly and correct the SF 86. His other explanations range from being unintelligible to not having a copy of his credit report when he was 
interviewed by the agent following his submission of the SF 86.  </SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F, 
pertaining to financial considerations, Guideline G, pertaining to alcohol consumption, Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, and Guideline J, pertaining 
to criminal conduct, with their  respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-24422.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-24422.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence,<A HREF="03-24422.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="03-24422.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-24422.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-24422.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-24422.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-24422.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-24422.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="03-24422.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides 
an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has repeatedly found it necessary to seek bankruptcy protection, most recently in 1996. He now has more than $25,000.00 in delinquent accounts 
with no plan to resolve any of them. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>; and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts</EM> apply. I have considered all mitigating conditions, and none apply. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline G, alcohol consumption is a security concern because excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, 
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. Those who abuse 
alcohol are more likely than others to engage in high risk, thoughtless, and sometimes violent behavior. Recurrent use of alcohol to the point of intoxication 
may affect an individual's ability to exercise the care, judgment, and discretion necessary to protect classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was convicted on six occasions of either DUI, DWI, or a negotiated reduced charge to one of those offenses between 1964 and 1999. He committed 
additional alcohol-related offenses in 1962, 1997, and 1998. On three occasions he has undergone alcohol treatment. DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Alcohol-related incidents away 
from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use</EM>; and DC 5: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Habitual or 
binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment </EM>apply in this case.<A HREF="03-24422.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has not consumed alcohol since his last DUI arrest in 1999 that was followed by intensive inpatient treatment. He now attends AA meetings 
regularly. Mitigating Conditions (MC) 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem</EM>; and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Positive 
changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</EM> apply.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>Applicant's long-term abstinence, and active and continuing involvement in AA are sufficient to overcome 
the alcohol consumption concerns that existed. Guideline G is decided for Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant provided numerous false answers in the SF 86 he submitted. His attempted  explanations neither provide an explanation nor do anything to mitigate 
his conduct.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personal security questionnaire, personal 
history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigation, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM> applies. I have considered all mitigating conditions under Guideline E and none apply. 
Guideline E is decided against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Criminal conduct under Guideline J is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness.  Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break rules.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant certified the answers he provided in the SF 86 were true, complete, and correct to the best of his knowledge. He also acknowledged that a knowing 
and willful false statement potentially subjected him to the criminal sanctions imposed by 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. Despite that warning he knowingly and willfully 
provided false answers in the SF86. DC1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM> applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Although Applicant committed many other alcohol-related criminal acts over the years, there is no indication he committed any criminal act after his 
falsification of the SF 86. Further, it should be noted that the SF 86 was signed on February 9, 2000, while Applicant was actively engaged in the intensive 
outpatient alcohol treatment that has now resulted in his complete abstinence from alcohol and regular attendance at AA meetings.  Accordingly, I find MC 1: 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The criminal behavior was recent</EM> and MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation </EM>apply. Under the rather unique factors present in this case, I 
find the mitigating conditions are sufficient to overcome the criminal conduct security concern alleged. Guideline J is decided for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the 
Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find  Applicant has failed to overcome the case against him and satisfy his ultimate 
burden of persuasion to demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his access to classified information.    </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
