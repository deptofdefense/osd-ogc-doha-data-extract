<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant's request for a security clearance.  In accordance with the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="01-22486.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="01-22486.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 21 January 2003 detailing the basis for its 
decision-security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 7 March 2003.  The case 
was assigned to me on 26 March 2003.  On 25 April 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant's security clearance.  The Government's case consisted of seven exhibits.  Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted three exhibits.  DOHA 
received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 5 May 2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a lengthy history of motor vehicle violations.  In May 1990, he was charged with speeding.  Answer.  In July 1990, Applicant was charged with 
failing to obey a traffic device for failing to clear an intersection before the light changed to red.  In October 1990, he was charged with speeding.  In June 1992, 
Applicant was charged with having unclear license plates because he had a tinted film covering the numbers.  In July 1992, he was charged with disregarding a 
stop sign while making a right turn at a "T" intersection.  Answer.  In November 1994, Applicant was charged with failing to yield to pedestrians in a 
crosswalk.  No one was injured and he paid a fine.  Ex. 3.  In May 1995, Applicant was again charged with speeding.  Another speeding offense occurred in 
January 1996.  In March 1996, Applicant was charged with speeding 11 miles per hour (mph) over the 65 mph speed limit.  He pled guilty and was paid a fine 
and court costs.  Ex. 4.  In February 1998, he was charged with disregard of a traffic control device.  He pled guilty and was ordered to pay a fine and court 
costs.  Ex. 5.  In May 1999, Applicant was charged with traveling 71 mph in a 55 mph zone.  Although he initially failed to appear in court, he pled guilty in 
December 1999 to traveling 69 mph in a 55 mph zone and was fined.  Ex. 6.  Applicant was charged with speeding 53 mph in a 40 mph zone.  He pled guilty to 
driving in an unsafe manner and was fined.  Ex. 7; Answer.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's driving record has been clean the past two years.  Ex. A.  He has never had his driver's license revoked or suspended.  Tr. 17.  He has not had any 
rules or regulations violations at work.  Tr. 18.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus 
or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations 
should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline E that Applicant was charged with numerous traffic violations between 1990 and 2000 including speeding (&para;&para; 1.a., 
c., g., h., i., k., l.), failing to observe a traffic device or stop sign (&para;&para; 1.b., c., j.), the improper display of license plates (&para;1.d.), and failing to yield to a pedestrian 
(&para; 1.f.).  Under Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations 
could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established by its evidence and Applicant's admissions that he has been involved in a pattern of rule violations.  DC 5.  While the rules 
violations may not be serious when evaluated individually, taken as a whole they show a disregard for safety of the public.  But, Applicant has undergone a 
change of attitude.  He is more mature and, after attending a driver safety course, has come to realize the error of his ways.  His driving record has been clear for 
the past two years and Applicant made a convincing case that he will not repeat such conduct.  After observing and listening to Applicant, I am convinced he 
does not represent a threat to the proper handling of classified information.  Finding is for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
