<P>Applicant's intention to maintain his dual citizenship and to keep his foreign passport raises doubts about his preferences, which must be resolved in favor of 
national security. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On June 25, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P>Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on July 10, 2002, and elected to have his case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department 
Counsel submitted the Government's written case (FORM) on or about July 31, 2002. Applicant did not submit a response to the FORM. The case was assigned 
to me on October 21, 2002.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is 21 years of age. He was born and raised in the United States. By virtue of his mother's German citizenship, applicant is automatically a German 
citizen. He exercised <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">his German citizenship in 1997 by applying for and receiving a German passport.<A HREF="01-11212.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> In a signed, sworn statement that he gave to the 
Defense Security Service (DSS) in February 2002, applicant stated that he intends to maintain his German citizenship and keep his German passport for the 
following reasons:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">First and foremost, my current employer has already indicated to me that they will probably not have a job for me when I graduate college . . . Secondly, I am 
not sure right now if I want to work in the military/defense sector of the computer industry. Giving up my German citizenship would make it much more 
difficult to obtain work in Germany if such an opportunity arises.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the same statement he added the following:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Being a US citizen, I realize that I have a responsibility to the US with regard to security matters. I have no intention whatsoever of sharing any information 
with Germany or with anyone for that matter. I have obtained dual citizenship only by being born to a German mother and if at any time in the future, if 
presented with an opportunity to work for a defense contractor requiring me to give up my dual citizenship status, I would do it.</SPAN></P> 
<P> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> <STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth Guidelines (divided into conditions that could raise a security concern and conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns) which must be followed by the Administrative Judge. Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating 
Factors are applicable:</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Preference</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Concern:</SPAN> When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to 
provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</P> 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern:</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>1. E2.A3.1.2.1: The exercise of dual citizenship.</P> 
<P>2. E2.A3.1.2.2:  Possession and/or use of a foreign passport.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns:</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>1. E2.A3.1.3.1: Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship</P> 
<P>or birth in a foreign country.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant was born and raised in the United States. By virtue of his mother's German citizenship, applicant is a citizen of Germany. He exercised his German 
citizenship in 1997 by applying for and receiving a German passport. Applicant intends to keep his German citizenship and an active German passport in order 
to keep open the option of working in Germany after he graduates from college.</P> 
<P>Individuals granted access to classified information must have a clear, unequivocal preference for the United States. In this case, applicant's intention to keep 
his German citizenship and an active German passport in order to leave open the possibility of moving to Germany and working for a German employer, raises 
doubts about applicant's preferences. Under the "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard set forth in DoD Directive 5220.6, these doubts must be 
resolved against applicant.</P>

<P>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for applicant.</P>
