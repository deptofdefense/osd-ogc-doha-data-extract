<P>Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns resulting from falsifications he made about alcohol-related arrests and subsequent alcohol treatment on his 
security clearance application.  Additionally, Applicant's continuing use of alcohol and his pattern of criminal conduct related to his excessive use of alcohol 
raise serious concerns about his security worthiness.  Clearance is denied.</P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On June 13, 2005, under the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="04-09468.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="04-09468.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns 
raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline E (Personal Conduct),  and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered 
the SOR in writing on June 27, 2005,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and requested that his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) on August 11, 2005.  The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 9.  By letter dated September 16, 2005, a copy 
of the FORM was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant 
received the FORM September 26, 2005.  He did not submit any information within the required time period.  On November 28, 2005, the case was assigned to 
me for a decision.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains five allegations of disqualifying conduct charged under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, five allegations charged under Guideline E, 
Personal Conduct, and two allegations charged under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all twelve allegations.  
Applicant's  admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 45 years old and employed as an electrical engineer  by a government contractor.  He is unmarried.  (Item 4.)  Applicant says he is a social drinker.  
(Item 3 at 3.)  When Applicant was approximately 16 years old, his father died.  Soon thereafter Applicant began to drink alcohol heavily. He also used 
marijuana.  (Item 8 at 84, 100.)<A HREF="04-09468.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from 1978 to at least July 2004.  (Item 7.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested in September 1980 and charged with (1) Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) and (2) Failure to Drive in One Lane.  He was found guilty of 
the reduced charge of Speeding for Count 1 after attending a program identified as P.A.C.T.  Count (2) was suspended and he was fined $112.00. ( Item 8 at 
100.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother died when he was 22 years old.  At about the time of  his mother's death, Applicant used cocaine and "mushrooms." (Item 8 at 84.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the age of 23, Applicant was working as a bartender part-time and was self-employed part-time in a pool-cleaning business. (Item 8 at 100.)  He lived in a 
group household consisting of a medical doctor who was a psychiatrist, a 33-year-old woman, and himself. (Item 8 at 80, 96.) <A HREF="04-09468.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On the evening of October 16, 1983, Applicant, a male friend, and Applicant's 33-year old female roommate, went bowling from approximately 8:30 pm to 
11:30 pm.  They drank three pitchers of beer while they bowled.  The trio left the bowling alley  in search of other friends.  The male friend drove his car.  
Applicant and his roommate traveled in Applicant's truck.  Applicant perceived an oncoming car in his travel lane, swerved, and lost control of his vehicle.  
The truck rolled over.  Applicant's roommate was ejected from the truck and killed.  A blood alcohol test confirmed Applicant was intoxicated at the time of 
the accident. (Item 8 at 97.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was indicted in February 1984 and charged with Manslaughter, a class 3 felony (Count 1) and Endangerment, a class 6 felony (Count 2).  The parents 
of the deceased woman did not favor a punitive sentence for Applicant, but proposed he receive counseling for his alcohol problem.  (Item 8 at 97; Pre-sentence 
Investigation at 4.)  The charges were amended to two counts of Endangerment.  Applicant pled no contest to the charges.  He was sentenced to three years of 
probation, ordered to work 300 hours in a work order program, and to pay restitution of $2,323.00. (Item 8 at 59-65.)  The terms of Applicant's probation 
required him to participate in any alcohol rehabilitative program ordered by his probation officer and to abstain completely from drinking alcoholic beverages.  
(Item 8 at 46.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1992 Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While Intoxicated.  He was found guilty of a reduced charge of Reckless Driving and was ordered to 
attend four weekend classes on alcohol abuse.  (Item 7.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested in June 2001 and charged with Driving Under the Influence.  He was found guilty, ordered to serve one day in jail, to pay a fine of $423, 
to attend 36 hours of alcohol education classes and to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.  (Item 7.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant goes out drinking with friends at least two nights a week, and sometimes three times a week.  (Item 7.)  He does not consider his use of alcohol to be 
a problem. (Item 3.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed and submitted electronically an EPSQ version of a security clearance application (SF-86) on June 25, 2001.  (Item 9.)  He also completed 
a SF-86, signed it on November 8, 2002, and submitted it on November 13, 2002.  (Items 4 and 5.)  Question 24 on the SF-86 asks if an applicant has ever been 
charged with or convicted of any offense related to alcohol or drugs.  In his response to Question 24 on the SF-86 he completed June 25, 2001, Applicant 
replied ""no" and failed to list his alcohol-related arrests in 1980, 1984, 1992, and 2001.  On the signed SF-86 he submitted on November 13, 2002, he replied 
"yes" and listed one offense, which he identified as DUI (driving under the influence of alcohol) on June 18, 2001.  (Item 5.)  Applicant did not list his 1980, 
1984, or 1992 alcohol-related arrests.  On July 2, 2004, in a signed, sworn statement to a special agent of the Defense Security Service, Applicant admitted  his 
alcohol-related arrests in 1984, 1992, and 2001.  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted his 1980 alcohol-related arrest.  He did not list all of his 
alcohol-related arrests on his SF-86 because he was embarrassed to do so. (Item 3, at 3.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 30 on the SF-86 reads as follows: "In the last 7 years, has your use of alcoholic beverages (such as liquor, beer, wine) resulted in any alcohol-related 
treatment or counseling (such as for alcohol abuse or alcoholism)?"  Applicant answered "no" to Question 30 on the SF-86 he submitted electronically on June 
26, 2001, and he did not list the alcohol counseling he was ordered to attend after his alcohol-related arrest on June 16, 2001.  (Item 9.)  However, it is not clear 
from the record whether Applicant had received his sentence at the time he completed his SF-86 on June 26, 2001 and knew of the counseling he was ordered to 
undertake.  Applicant also answered "no" to Question 30 when he completed and signed his SF-86 in November 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 21 on the SF-86 asks if an Applicant has ever been charged with or convicted of a felony offense.  In his response to Question 21 on the June 26, 
2001, version of the SF-86, Applicant answered "yes" and listed his felony endangerment arrest and conviction resulting from the fatal accident he was 
involved in October 1983.  In his response to Question 21 on the November 13, 2002 version of his SF-86, Applicant answered "yes" and listed his DUI 
conviction of June 2001.  He did not list his felony arrest and conviction in the fatal automobile accident in October 1983 on the SF-86 he completed and 
certified on about November 13, 2002. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's four alcohol-related arrests resulted from operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.  He deliberately falsified his answers to 
Questions 24, 30, and 21 on his June 26, 2001 SF-86 and his November 13, 2002 SF-86.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR DOHA</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> alleged Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to the point of intoxication, from approximately 1978 to at least July 2004 (&para; 1.a.); that in 
September 1980, he was arrested and charged with (1) Driving While Intoxicated and (2) Failure to Drive in One Lane, and that he was found guilty of a 
reduced charge of (1) Speeding, paid a fine of $112.00, and Count (2) was suspended  (&para;1.b.); that in about February 1984 he was indicted on charges of (1) 
anslaughter, a felony, and (2) Endangerment, a felony, resulting from an accident that occurred while he was driving while intoxicated, and the charges were 
amended to two counts of Endangerment, to which he pled no contest, was sentenced to three years of probation, ordered to work 300 hours in a work order 
program, and to pay restitution of $2,323.00 (&para; 1.c.); that he was arrested in March 1992  and charged with Driving While Intoxicated, found guilty of a reduced 
charge of Reckless Driving, and ordered to attend four weekend classes on alcohol abuse (&para; 1.d.); and that he was arrested in June 2001 and charged with 
Driving Under the Influence, found guilty, incarcerated for one day, fined $423.00, and ordered to attend 36 hours of alcohol education classes and five 
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings (&para; 1.e.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A7.1.2.1.<A HREF="04-09468.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and DC E2.A7.1.2.5.<A HREF="04-09468.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> are raised by Applicant's admissions and the record evidence.  
Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, and failure to control impulses, thereby increasing the risk of 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.  The record shows, and Applicant admits, that he was arrested four times between 1980 
and 2001 for alcohol-related incidents away from work, thus raising a concern under DC E2.A7.1.2.1. of Guideline G.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits he consumed alcohol at times to excess and to the point of intoxication from 1978 to at least July 2004.  His habitual consumption of alcohol 
to the point of impaired judgment raises concerns under DC E2.A7.1.2.5.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concerns raised by Applicant's Guideline G disqualifying conduct could be mitigated if the alcohol related incidents do not indicate a pattern 
(Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A7.1.3.1.), the problem with excessive alcohol consumption occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a 
recent problem (MC E2.A7.1.3.2.), and if Applicant shows positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety (MC E2.A7.1.3.3.).  Applicant's disqualifying 
conduct could also be mitigated if, following a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, he successfully completed inpatient or outpatient 
rehabilitation along with aftercare requirements, participated frequently in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization, abstained from alcohol 
for a period of at least 12 months, and received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional.  (MC E2.A7.1.3.4.)  Since the record evidence 
does not indicate Applicant has received a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, MC E2.A7.1.3.4. is inapplicable.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's episodic heavy drinking in the past indicates a lifestyle and pattern of behavior.  He continues to use alcohol despite four arrests for behavior related 
to his excessive use of alcohol and  two court-ordered alcohol education programs.  He denies that alcohol is a problem in his life, but does not provide 
evidence of positive changes in behavior supportive of the responsible use of alcohol.  I conclude that MC E2.A7.1.3.1., MC E2.A7.1.3.2., and MC 
E2.A7.1.3.3. do not apply to Applicant's case.<A HREF="04-09468.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  The Guideline G allegations in the SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E, Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant raised concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, by falsifying material facts in his responses to Questions 24, 30, 
and 21 on two versions of the SF-86 that he submitted electronically.  DOHA alleged that on a SF-86 submitted electronically on June 26, 2001, Applicant 
answered "no" to Question 24.  DOHA further alleged that when Applicant  electronically submitted a SF-86 on November 13, 2002 , signed and certified on 
November 8, 2002, he admitted and listed only one alcohol-related offense in his response to Question 24 when he knew he had been charged with three 
additional alcohol-related offenses which he did not list. (&para; 2.a.; &para; 2.c.)  DOHA also alleged Applicant falsified his response to Question 30 on both the June 26, 
2001 and November 13, 2002 versions of his SF-86 by deliberately failing to list the alcohol counseling ordered by the court when he was found guilty of 
Driving While Intoxicated in June 2001. (&para; 2.b.; &para; 2.d.)  DOHA also alleged Applicant falsified material facts in his response to Question 21 on the SF-86 he 
completed and certified on November 13, 2002.  Question 21 asks an applicant whether he or she has ever been charged with or convicted of any felony 
offenses.  An affirmative response by the applicant requires that he or she list the dates and nature of the felony offenses and the subsequent adjudication of 
them.  When he completed and signed his SF-86 in November 2002, Applicant answered Question 21 in the affirmative and listed his DUI conviction in June 
2001.  (Items 4 and 5.)  He did not list his felony conviction for Endangerment in February 1984.  (&para; 2.e.)<A HREF="04-09468.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E conduct, which involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules 
and regulations, could indicate that an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in SOR , the Government has established its case.  Applicant's failure to answer Questions 24, 30, and 21 
completely, truthfully, and correctly raises a security concern under Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A8.1.2.2. of Guideline E.  In his answer to the SOR, 
Applicant admitted deliberately concealing information about his four alcohol-related arrests because he considered them embarrassing.  Applicant's 
embarrassment could make him vulnerable to coercion and blackmail. (DC E2.A5.1.2.4.)  His conduct raises additional concerns under DC E2.A5.1.2.5. 
because it suggests a pattern of dishonesty or rule violation.  Applicant's reticence to reveal the truth about his past conduct suggests that, under some 
circumstances, he may put his interests before those of the Government.  The ability to be truthful goes to the essence of an individual's security worthiness. It 
is well established that embarrassment is not a mitigating condition under the Directive.  ISCR Case No. 99-0557 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul.10, 2000).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating condition (MC) E2.A5.1.3.1 does not apply to the facts of this case: the information Applicant withheld is pertinent to a determination of his 
judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability.  Only one other mitigating condition under Guideline E might be applicable to the instant case.  The security concern 
raised by Applicant's disqualifying conduct could be mitigated if the falsifications were isolated, not recent, and if the Applicant subsequently provided the 
correct information voluntarily. (MC E2.A5.1.3.2.)  While Applicant supplied the correct information when questioned by a special agent of the Defense 
Investigative Service in July 2004, approximately 20 months had passed since he had completed and certified his SF-86 in November 2002.  Applicant's 
falsifications were not isolated incidents and they are recent.  Accordingly, allegations in subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.e. of the SOR are concluded against the 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J -  Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged that Applicant's admitted history of excessive alcohol consumption and four alcohol-related arrests and convictions, specified in 
allegations &para;&para; 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e. under Guideline G, constituted a history or pattern of criminal activity under Guideline J of the Directive.  (&para; 3.a.)  
DOHA also alleged that Applicant's falsifications on his SF-86, alleged in &para;&para; 2.a, 2.b., 2.c., 2.d., and 2.e. under Guideline E of the SOR, were deliberate and 
intentional pursuant 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 and constituted criminal conduct under Guideline J of the Directive.  (&para; 3.b.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concern under Guideline J is that an individual's history or pattern of criminal activity raises doubts about his judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based upon trust and confidence.  
Where the facts proven by the Government or admitted by the applicant raise doubts about the applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant 
has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nevertheless security worthy.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admitted deliberate falsifications on his SF-86 and his admitted history of excessive use of alcohol and four alcohol-related arrests and convictions 
raise security concerns under Guideline J Disqualifying Conditions (DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 and E2.A10.1.2.2.<A HREF="04-09468.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several mitigating conditions might be applicable in Applicant's case.  Applicant's most recent alcohol-related conviction occurred in 2001, four years ago; 
thus, his arrests for alcohol-related criminal acts are not recent.  However, Applicant's alcohol-related arrests were not isolated events but manifest a pattern of 
criminal conduct.  Additionally, in his interview with the special agent of the Defense Security Service and in his answer to the SOR, Applicant acknowledged 
he continues to drink alcohol.  So, while Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A10.1.3.1. of Guideline J applies in mitigation to Applicant's disqualifying conduct 
under Guideline G, MC E2.A10.1.3.2. of the Guideline does not.  Since Applicant failed to present clear evidence of successful rehabilitation, MC 
E2.A10.1.3.6. is also inapplicable in mitigation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admitted deliberate falsifications regarding his disqualifying conduct under Guideline G also raise security concerns under DC E.2 A10.1.2.1 and 
DC E2.A10.1.2.2.  Since Applicant's deliberate falsifications were recent and numerous, MC E2.A10.1.3.1. and MC E2.A10.1.3.2. of Guideline J are 
inapplicable.  Similarly, since Applicant provided no clear evidence of successful rehabilitation, MC E2.A10.1.3.6. does not apply.  Accordingly, the Guideline 
J allegations in the SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 3 (Dec.27, 1999), DOHA's Appeal Board states that an administrative judge, in deciding an Applicant's security worthiness,
