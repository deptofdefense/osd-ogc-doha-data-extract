He became a 
naturalized United States citizen in 1986.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's immediate family members, including his father, parents-in law, and his seven siblings are citizens of and 
reside in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Sudan</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN>The evidence establishes that Applicant is vulnerable to foreign influence.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> By not mitigating these foreign influence security concerns, 
Applicant failed to demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. Clearance is denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On May 7, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 
and 12829) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to 
Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings 
and determine whether clearance should be granted, or denied. The SOR was based on foreign influence (guideline B) concerns because of the foreign residency 
and/or citizenship of close family members (father, parents-in law,  brothers, and sisters).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant filed a <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">signed and sworn, </SPAN>notarized response, dated June 12, 2003, to the allegations set forth in the SOR. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He requested a clearance decision based on 
a hearing record b</SPAN>efore a DOHA Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on August 11, 2003, to conduct a hearing. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A Notice 
of Hearing was issued to the parties on August 22, 2003, and the hearing was held on September 9, 2003, and September 10, 2003. </SPAN> </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered three documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits1 through 3), and no witnesses were called. Applicant, through 
counsel, offered one documentary exhibit (Applicant Exhibit A) and offered the testimony of three other witnesses and  himself.  All exhibits were entered into 
evidence. The transcript (TR) was received on September 18, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B of the Directive because the majority of Applicant's 
immediate family members  reside in and are citizens of  Sudan, and they may be subject to duress. The SOR contains seven allegations, 1.a. through 1.g., under 
Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  In his response to the SOR, Applicant denies 1.e. and admits all the other allegations. The admitted allegations are 
incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the testimony of the witnesses at the hearing, and 
the documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 56 year old employee of a defense contractor. He <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was born in Sudan in 1947. He first came to the United States in 1975 for less than one year to 
work here on an interim basis.  In 1977 he returned to the United States to enter a masters program, and he received his degree in civil engineering from a 
United States  university in 1979. He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1986. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His wife, whom he married in 1983, was born in Sudan and is now a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">United States citizen. They have three children, who were born in the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant </SPAN>is a principal of a consulting engineering company which is a defense contractor. Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has been extremely successful in his business and has a 
significant financial net worth in the United States (Tr at 88).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father is a citizen of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and resides in Sudan.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He has weekly telephonic contact with his father.  Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has traveled to Sudan every year since 1994 
to visit his father, and he gives him a few hundred dollars during each visit  (Tr at 96, 97).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant testified that his father is retired.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father-in-law and mother-in-law are also citizens of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and reside in Sudan</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He testified that neither of them </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">have worked for the government of Sudan.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has seven siblings, who are citizens of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and reside in Sudan</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant also has one brother who resides in Saudi Arabia, and one who is a citizen of 
and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">resides in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the United Kingdom.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  He testified that none of his brothers or sisters </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">work for the government of Sudan. Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> e-mails his brother in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the 
United Kingdom</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and a niece in the Sudan each approximately five of six times a year  (Tr at 94, 95).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to Applicant, three witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. All three witnesses have known applicant for a significant length of time and were 
aware of Applicant's background and the concern of the Government regarding Applicant's potential foreign influence problems with Sudan.  They all strongly 
recommended him for a position of trust without any reservations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant introduced a lease agreement between himself and the Government of the United States (Exhibit A) which establishes that Applicant has leased the 
apartment, which he owns in Egypt, to the United States Government for the period August 15, 2003, to August 14, 2008.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have taken official notice of Exhibit 2, "Issue Briefing of Congress," dated January 23, 2003, and prepared by the Congressional Research Service, which was 
offered into evidence by Department Counsel and stipulated to by Applicant's Counsel. The report states, "Sudan is considered a rogue state by the United 
States because of its support of international terrorism, although in recent years it has taken some measures to improve its record." The report continues that 
while there has been some recent, limited cooperation by Sudan, a number of terrorist groups continue to use Sudan as safe haven. "In November 2001, 
President Bush renewed U.S. bilateral sanctions on Sudan and the State Department kept Sudan on the terrorism list."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>           Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative 
Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Each 
adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular 
condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed </P> 
 
<P>whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, etc. </P> 
 
<P>Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>FOREIGN INFLUENCE (GUIDELINE B) </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in, a foreign 
country;</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.3.1. A determination that the immediate family member(s). . . in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </P> 
 
<P>the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established a reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of foreign influence. Applicant's 
immediate family members, his father,  his parents-in-law and his seven siblings are citizens of</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and reside in Sudan</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  </SPAN> The possession of such ties raises a 
security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for him. ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). As 
Applicant's immediate family members are citizens of and reside in Sudan, a country which is undisputedly hostile to the Government of the United States, and 
which fosters terrorism, Applicant has a very heavy burden of showing that these family members do not pose a security risk. ISCR Case No. 01-26893 
(October 16, 2002). Applicant has not met this substantial burden. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the current status of Sudan, the extremely close ties that Applicant has, primarily with his father but also with his siblings, which have manifested 
themselves in weekly telephone calls and </SPAN>yearly visits to visit his father and the rest of the family in Sudan, Disqualifying Condition E2.A2.1.2.1. applies.  
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because of these factors, I cannot conclude</SPAN> that his family is not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Accordingly, Foreign Influence Mitigating 
Condition </SPAN>E2.A2.1.3.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> does not apply to this case. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing Applicant testified to a hypothetical question that he would not betray the United States if his family was threatened (Tr. at 100-102).  Since there 
has been no actual set of circumstances that occurred similar to the hypothetical fact pattern, I can not give his statement serious consideration although his 
answer was credible. ISCR Case No. 02-26826 (November 12, 2003).  Applicant's apartment in Egypt is now leased by the United States Government until 
August 2008. It does not have negative security concern. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has failed  to mitigate the security concerns discussed in the SOR, thereby failing to demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with national security to 
grant him the clearance. Guideline B is found against Applicant.</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
