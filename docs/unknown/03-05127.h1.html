<P>The Applicant had two alcohol related arrests when he was in his early 20s.  Since the second arrest, he has made considerable changes in his lifestyle 
supportive of his sobriety.  The alcohol related offenses do not indicate a pattern and the Applicant submitted considerable mitigating evidence.  Adverse 
inference is overcome.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 27, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on July 28, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was received by the undersigned on September 22, 2003, 
and a Notice of Hearing was issued on September 24, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A hearing was held on October 14, 2003, at which the Government presented seven  documentary exhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also 
submitted two exhibits.  The transcript was received on October 27, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 24, single and has Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as Software Engineer 2, and 
he seeks to obtain a Secret-level DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and 
the live testimony.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses 
intoxicants to excess.  The Applicant admitted all the allegations of the Statement of Reasons.  Those admissions are deemed findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was a non-drinker until his last year in college in State One.  Then, he joined a fraternity and began drinking on a daily basis.  On June 11, 2001, 
he attended a party and drank to excess.  He was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol when he was driving home.  The Applicant plead guilty to 
an amended charge of Alcohol Related Reckless Driving.  He received three years informal probation, a fine and required to attend a First Offender Alcohol 
Program.  (Government Exhibits 4 through 7.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 1, 2002, the Applicant was with some friends in State Two.  The Applicant drank to intoxication and then drove.  He was stopped by police and 
arrested for Driving Under the Influence.  He plead guilty to an amended charge of Reckless Driving and was fined.  (Government Exhibit 3, Transcript at 55-59.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his sworn statement, the Applicant admitted this second arrest, which was unknown to the Defense Security Service Special Agent, but denied drinking at the 
time.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 2.)  However, at the hearing and in his Answer to the SOR, he admitted drinking to excess that day.  The Applicant explained 
that he was confused about what to admit during the interview because of the ongoing criminal case in State Two.  He was represented by counsel, who had 
advised him not to admit to anything.  (Transcript at 49-53.)  The Applicant was extremely remorseful over his conduct and stated that he thought, when he 
admitted the allegation in the SOR, which included the breathalyzer results, he was correcting all his prior actions.  (Transcript at 59-64.)  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The Applicant testified that he has really matured in the last year.  He has a fianc&eacute;, with whom he had a daughter in 2003.  Since his second arrest, the 
Applicant has reduced his drinking habits.  Now that he has a family, he no longer associates with his fraternity drinking buddies.  He may drink once a month 
at a family outing.  When he does drink he only has one or two and he never drives after drinking.  (Transcript at 35-37.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The first and second line supervisors of the Applicant submitted a joint letter of recommendation (Applicant's Exhibit A).  They state that the Applicant has 
been a trusted employee for over two years and that he "exercises a high degree of professionalism at work and performs well with only general supervision."  
The supervisors also point out that the Applicant has "been recognized twice for performance achievements at high levels" by company management.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's fianc&eacute; also submitted a letter on his behalf (Applicant's Exhibit B).  She sets forth in great detail how the Applicant's life has changed since 
they got together, and especially since the birth of their daughter in July 2003.  She concludes her letter by saying, "Since I have met [the Applicant] he has 
made many positive and wise decisions about his life.  He has improved his habits and found positive friends to help him.  He has made a conscious decision to 
become and stay sober.  He has improved his living standards. [The Applicant] has removed the negative influences in his life."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline G (Alcohol consumption)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to 
alcohol abuse;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) the alcohol related incidents do not indicate a pattern;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant was involved in two alcohol related incidents 
(Guideline G).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.  The evidence shows that, since his second arrest in September 2002, the 
Applicant has completely eliminated alcohol abuse from his life.  The two arrests do not indicate a pattern of alcohol abuse, but rather the conduct of an 
immature person who was not ready to accept the responsibilities of adult life.  His testimony shows that work, his fianc&eacute; and his child have had a profound 
impact on him.  In addition to his testimony, documentary evidence from his supervisors and his fianc&eacute; support his statements about his exemplary work 
performance and the changes in his personal life that bring Mitigating Condition 2 to bear on his current conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, application of the General Factors is appropriate and supports a decision in the Applicant's favor.  The Applicant was an immature young man when 
the conduct occurred, but he has shown good judgment since the second arrest (factor d.), he is motivated to continue his sobriety (factor g.), he shows 
considerable evidence of rehabilitation (factor f.), and, under the circumstances of this case, the probability that the Applicant will return to his drinking ways 
are virtually nil (factor i.).  In evaluating this case under the whole person concept, I have specifically considered all the evidence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  
Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 of the Government's 
Statement of Reasons.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.a.: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
