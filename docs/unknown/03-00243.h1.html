<P>Applicant has a history of delinquent debts he primarily accrued in connection with medical care he believed to be covered by his medical insurance at work.  
Unable to address his debts for a number of years due to illness and reduced work, he has since entered into repayment arrangements with most of his creditors 
and established payment histories with them.  Applicant by his good-faith payment efforts mitigates security concerns associated with his delinquent debts, and 
he successfully refutes allegations of falsification of his security clearance application (SF-86) by a demonstrated misunderstanding of the status of his debts.  
Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P>

</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 3, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on December 8, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on June 2, 2004, and scheduled for hearing on 
July 20, 2004.  A hearing was convened on July 20, 2004, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of six exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses 
(including himself) and eleven exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on July 30, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>PROCEDURAL ISSUES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before the close of the hearing, Applicant requested and was granted additional time to supplement th record with details of his inquiries and payments to his 
listed creditors.  Applicant was afforded 14 days to supplement the record.  The Government, in turn, was afforded seven days to  respond.  Within the time 
permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with documentation of payments and correspondence with his creditors.  His submitted exhibits are accepted as 
Applicant's exhibits J through P.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have incurred numerous delinquent debts: twelve in all that exceed $11,000.00 in total.   Under Guideline E, 
Applicant is alleged to have falsified his SF-86 of July 2002 by omitting an unpaid judgment and his delinquent debts over 180 and 90 days delinquent, 
respectively.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of his debts covered by Guideline  F., but denied the remaining allegations.  He claimed he never received 
any bills for several of the listed debts and believed most of the remaining debts were medical-related, which should have been paid by insurance.  Of the 
remaining four listed debts, he denied any knowledge of them.  Applicant claims the debts were the result of business losses incurred in connection with his 
financial support of a small business he operated between June 1998 and early 1999.  He claimed his wife had been sending monthly $50.00 payments on two 
of the listed debts (creditors d and j), and he has received no responses to his written inquiries.  Applicant denied falsifying his July 2002 SF-86, claiming no 
knowledge of the delinquent debts attributable to him.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 59-year-old truck driver for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by 
Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A truck driver for his current defense contractor since 1989, and possessed of little formal education, Applicant and his wife got into financial difficulties in the 
early 1990s as the result of work slowdowns and illness to each of them. Altogether, he accumulated over $11,000.00 in delinquent debts (mostly medical-related) with 12 separate creditors.  Most of his listed debts represent accrued bills for medical services Applicant and his wife received, which he believed were 
covered by his employer's medical insurance (R.T., at 49-50).  Because his work required so much travel, he seldom saw the bills as they were received and 
relied on his wife and a driver friend (Ms. A) to take of them.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Sometime before 1996, an investor group known as A Company purchased Applicant's trucking employer.  As the parent company of Applicant's employer, A 
Company assumed responsibility for the payment of driver insurance premiums that had been the recognized practice with Applicant's employer.  By 
Applicant's accounts, A Company quit paying the insurance premiums without notifying Applicant and his fellow drivers.  After two failed bankruptcy attempts 
in 1999 and 2001, A Company ceased business operations and sold off its assets to another investor group: B Company.  Upon completing its purchase of 
Applicant's employer's assets, it quickly arranged for health insurance benefits for its drivers (Applicant included), and today Applicant's insurance premiums 
are fully funded by the parent entity of his employer.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant currently nets around $2,800.00 a month from his workman's compensation, which he relies on to sustain him until he is medically able to return to 
work (R.T., at 50-54). His wife receives $380.00 a month in social security benefits (R.T., at 53).  Since receiving the SOR they have made arrangements with 
their creditors to make small monthly payments on the listed delinquent debts they have identified as theirs (creditor 1.f being excepted) and document monthly 
payments on most of the debts, including his lone listed credit card debt with creditor 1.b.  Their monthly payments to these creditors total $1,288.83 (<EM>see</EM> exs. 
D through H and J through P; R.T., at 41-42, 74).  They use their remaining monthly funds to buy necessities, pay their mortgage, assist their two daughters 
who reside with them, and pay their old debts (R.T., at 74-79)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Asked to complete his July 2002 SF-86, Applicant omitted his creditor 1.a judgment as well as his debts that were 180 days and 90 days delinquent, 
respectively.  The form he completed he neither signed nor was afforded an opportunity to thoroughly review (R.T., at 89-90).  He attributes his omissions to 
misunderstandings over whether he had any debts that were 180 and 90 days delinquent.  Relying on his spouse and Ms. A to take care of his debts while he 
was on the road, he assumed his debts were either payed by his medical insurer or his spouse and never knew any of his debts were delinquent until he was 
shown a credit report by an interviewing DSS agent in August 2002 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2; R.T., at 49-50 and 84-87).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant expresses every intention of honoring his payment arrangements and paying off his delinquent debts on schedule (R.T., at 91-92).  He is well 
regarded by supervisor and work colleagues and respected for his honesty, reliability and trustworthiness.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the 
pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are 
intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (<EM>e.g., </EM>loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 6.  The individual initiated good-faith efforts to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate 
that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG> None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating conditions:</STRONG> None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding 
that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the 
evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and 
materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the 
evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant accrued considerable delinquent debts between 1995 and 1999: some medically related which his insurance carrier has not paid, and some consumer-related.  Altogether, Applicant accumulated over $11,000.00 of medical and consumer debts.  The Government's security concerns center on the amount of 
delinquent debt he compiled between 1995 and 1999 and his ensuing omissions of these debts from his pertinent answers to his SF-86.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Financial Issues</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Relying on his medical insurance to pay his medical bills from creditors 1.a and 1.d through 1.l, Applicant did not address these debts for many years.   
Struggling finances attributable to loss of work accounted for the deficiencies with his other two creditors (creditors 1.b and 1.c).  Each of Applicant's debts 
became delinquent and were ultimately either taken to judgment (as with creditor 1.a) or charged off by the creditors.  On this record, two of the Disqualifying 
Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations apply: DC 1 (history of not meeting financial obligations) and DC 3 (inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant's debts are attributable to a variety of extenuating circumstances.  His covered medical debts that were written off between 1995 and 1999 involve 
debts for medical services and assumed wrongly by he and his wife  to be covered by his medical insurance.  His remaining debts  debts involve consumer-related debts he was unable to address while ill and out of work.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Extenuation of Applicant's debts is not enough in and of itself to overcome the adverse trust implications associated with his accumulating so many delinquent 
debts without any evidence of addressing them until he received the SOR.  But Applicant documents his entering into repayment arrangements with most of his 
creditors and establishing payment histories.  Considering that the majority of his debts involve medical services which should have been covered by his 
employer's medical insurance, but wasn't, his repayment efforts with each of these creditors is entitled to considerable credit.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant mitigates active security concerns associated with his debt problems by his payment efforts with most of his covered debts.  Appraising Applicant's 
extenuating circumstances with respect to all of his covered debts,  Applicant may take advantage of MC 3 (conditions largely beyond the person's control) of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines to extenuate his debt delinquencies.  He may also avail himself of the mitigation benefits of MC 6 (initiated good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors) based on his repayment efforts.</P> 
 
<P>Taking into account all of the circumstances of Applicant's accumulated debts and the good- faith efforts he demonstrated in satisfying his debts, even in the 
face of his continuing disability, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.a through 1.l as to the allegations governed by the Adjudicative 
Guidelines pertinent to Guideline F.  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG>Falsification Concerns</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Posing potential security concerns, too, are Applicant's documented omissions of his creditor 1.a judgment and his covered delinquent debts from the SF-86 
submitted electronically in his behalf in July 2002.  His omissions are, however, attributable to his mistaken uncertainty over whether his debts (which he 
believed were either covered by his insurance or otherwise were taken care of by his wife and friend while he out on the road).   True, Applicant might  have 
been more diligent about checking on the status of his debts and initiated court proceedings by creditor 1.a.  Still, mistaken understanding of the status of his 
debts, attributable to both his very limited formal education and his reliance on others to address his bills, provide the most credible explanation for his SF-86 
omissions in this case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's explanations of his omissions are persuasive enough to avert inferences of knowing and wilful omission.  There being no misconduct substantiated, 
no need to show extenuation or mitigation arises.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-13568 (February 13, 2004).  While Applicant's efforts lack due diligences inquiries of 
the state of his debts,  his efforts reveal enough mistaken reliance on the unknown state of his debts to enable him to refute the allegations of falsification of his 
SF-86 covered in subparagraphs 2.a through 2.c Guideline E. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P>
