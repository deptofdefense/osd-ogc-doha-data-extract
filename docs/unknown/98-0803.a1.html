<P>Administrative Judge Robert R. Gales issued a decision dated May 4, 1999 in which he
concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed this decision.  For the reasons set forth below, the
Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal presents the issue of whether the Administrative Judge failed to properly
apply pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines.</P>

<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated
December 11, 1998 to Applicant.  The SOR was based on Criterion H (Drug Involvement),
Criterion E (Personal Conduct) and Criterion J (Criminal Conduct).<A HREF="98-0803.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A></P>

<P>A hearing was held on March 15, 1999.  The Administrative Judge subsequently issued a
written decision.  The Judge concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the Board on
Applicant's appeal from the Judge's adverse decision.</P>

<P><STRONG>Administrative Judge's Findings and Conclusions</STRONG><A HREF="98-0803.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A></P>

<P>Applicant began using marijuana in about 1979 while he was in junior high school or high
school and continued to use it occasionally in social settings until at least May 1998.  He also
used cocaine on at least one occasion while in high school.  His three most recent involvements
with marijuana came in early 1998 during a period of depression and when he was on vacation.
Applicant failed a drug test administered by his employer in June 1998 and subsequently
attended a substance abuse treatment program, which he completed.  Applicant professes to be
opposed to illegal drugs but sees nothing wrong with marijuana.  He has declared a willingness
to forgo using marijuana in the future while working at his current facility.  He continues to
associate with marijuana abusers and attends parties where marijuana is smoked.  Applicant is
strongly supported for a position of trust by friends, colleagues, and co-workers.</P>

<P>The Government established its case regarding drug involvement.  Applicant continued his
irregular, occasional abuse of marijuana for 19 years and his use ceased about 10 months
before the closing of the record.  The recency and frequency of the use negates the applicability
of Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions 1<A HREF="98-0803.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> and 2<A HREF="98-0803.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>.  Applicant declined to state flatly and
unconditionally that he would not use marijuana in the future and he continues to associate
with known substance abusers.  Thus Mitigating Condition 3<A HREF="98-0803.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> does not apply.  Applicant's
completion of the drug treatment program supports the applicability of Mitigating Condition
4<A HREF="98-0803.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> but an unconditional avowal against future use of illegal substances as well as a longer
period of abstinence is required.  Applicant's brief experimentation with cocaine is mitigated.</P>

<P><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></P>

<P><U>Whether the Administrative Judge failed to apply pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative
Guidelines</U>.  The Administrative Judge concluded that Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition
(MC) 2 and MC 3 did not apply to Applicant's marijuana use.  The Judge applied MC 4 to the
case but concluded that the record evidence in support of that mitigating condition was of
insufficient magnitude to overcome the Government's case.  Applicant contends the Judge
erred because the record supports mitigation of the Government's case through the application
of MC 2, MC 3, and MC 4.  Applicant's argument is not persuasive.</P>

<P><U>Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 2</U>.  This mitigating condition does not give any
definition of, or guidance about, the meaning of the words "isolated" or "infrequent."  Since the
Directive requires a common sense decision (Section F.3.), an Administrative Judge must
apply undefined terms such as "isolated" and "infrequent" in a reasonable, common sense way
after careful consideration of all the evidence, including that which relates to length, frequency,
and pattern of drug use.  <EM>Cf</EM>. ISCR Case No. 98-0394 (June 10, 1999) at pp. 2-3
(Administrative Judge must apply undefined terms in Directive in a reasonable, common sense
way).  In this case the Judge cited the "recency" and "frequency" of Applicant's marijuana use
as a reason for not applying MC 2.  The Judge made the statement in conjunction with his
observation that Applicant occasionally used marijuana over a time span of 19 years, ending
about 10 months before the record closed.  Given the length and pattern of Applicant's
marijuana involvement, the Judge's decision not to apply MC 2 was reasonable.</P>

<P><U>Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 3</U>.  In a sworn statement given to an agent of the
Defense Investigative Service (DIS)<A HREF="98-0803.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A> in October 1998 Applicant stated the following
regarding his feelings about marijuana and his future use of it: "I am totally against illegal
drugs such as crack and cocaine but I don't think there is anything wrong with marijuana.  I
intend to refrain from smoking marijuana in the future because as a licensed electrician, I
realize that by using marijuana, I could kill myself on the job.  I do not intend to use marijuana
especially while working at [site] because I like my job and do not want to risk losing it."  At
the hearing Applicant was more unequivocal concerning his desire to abstain, but his hearing
testimony does not render erroneous the Judge's conclusions concerning future intent. 
Therefore, the Judge was not unreasonable in concluding Applicant's statements do not express
an unconditional desire to abstain from using marijuana in the future.  Moreover, MC 3
requires a <EM>demonstrated</EM> intent not to use any drugs in the future.  Applicant's statements of
intent at the hearing, together with other record evidence (completion of a treatment program, a
modest ten month period of abstinence) provide <EM>some</EM> evidence of a commitment to remain
drug free.  However, the Judge noted the existence of countervailing evidence (Applicant's
earlier conditional statement and his continuing association with marijuana users at social
functions) when considering MC 3.  Administrative Judges have some discretion when
applying disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the Directive.  In this instance
Applicant falls short of demonstrating that the Judge erred by not finding his marijuana use
mitigated through the vehicle of MC 3.</P>

<P><U>Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 4</U>.  In his appeal brief, Applicant makes only passing
reference to MC 4.  While the requirements of MC 4 are arguably satisfied in this case, the
mere presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not solely dispositive of
a case.  Even when a disqualifying or mitigating condition is applicable, the Judge should not
consider it in isolation and without regard to the record evidence as a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR
Case No. 97-0825 (January 7, 1999) at p. 3.  Considering the record as a whole, the Board
concludes the Judge gave a rational explanation for concluding Applicant's history of
marijuana use was not mitigated by his successful completion of a drug treatment program.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></P>

<P>Applicant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating error.  Accordingly, the Board
affirms the Administrative Judge's May 4, 1999 decision.</P>
