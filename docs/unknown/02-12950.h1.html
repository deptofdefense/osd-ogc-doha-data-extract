<P>On May 1972, when Applicant was 35 years of age, he was indicted and charged with one count of  Grand Larceny for stealing a 1968 Caterpillar bulldozer. 
Applicant was found guilty of Grand Larceny on September 12, 1972. He was sentenced to an indeterminate term of one to ten years imprisonment. The 
provisions of Title 10 U.S.C. 986 apply. Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance is denied.   <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I do not recommend further consideration of this case for a 
waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On February 14, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In two signed and sworn statements, dated March 13, 2003, and May 5, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He requested that his case be 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On July 25, 2003, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written case, which was prepared on May 
24, 2003. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) <A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided to the Applicant, and he was given the opportunity to file objections and 
submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant filed a response to the FORM on July 16, 2003. The case was assigned to this 
Administrative Judge on July 30, 2003.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the FORM, Department Counsel offered 13 documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 13)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's one page response to the FORM has been identified and 
entered into the record as Exhibit A. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the SOR. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the SOR, the Government alleges that 
a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The SOR contains four allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d. under 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline J</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">.  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits all allegations except 1.b. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The admitted allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">admitted</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and upon due 
consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is 67 years old and married. He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks to retain a DoD security clearance in connection with his

<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant was arrested in 1962 and charged with HOLD JNV-DC. He was ordered to pay a $50.00 fine and serve three days in jail. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">On May 11, 1972, when Applicant was 35 years of age, he was indicted and charged with one count of  Grand Larceny for stealing a 1968 Caterpillar bulldozer. 
Applicant was found guilty of Grand Larceny on September 12, 1972. He was sentenced to an indeterminate term of one to ten years imprisonment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">                On July 3, 1985, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence. He was found guilty and was  fined $250.00, sentenced to 30 
days in jail and his driver's license was suspended for six months.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">that must be carefully</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> considered</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>CRIMINAL CONDUCT (GUIDELINE J</STRONG>)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Concern:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">a. Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">b. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">c. Convictions in a Federal or State court . . . of a crime and sentence to imprisonment foe a term exceeding one year; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">g. Potentially disqualifying conditions c. and., above, may not be mitigated unless, where meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretary of Defense . . . has 
granted a waiver.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to guidelines J:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government has established its case under Guideline J. Applicant's conduct that is the basis for allegation of 1.b. of the SOR is criminal and did result in 
his receiving an </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">indeterminate term of one to ten years imprisonment</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under the provisions of Title 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, a person who has been convicted in a 
Federal or State court, including courts martial, and sentenced to imprisonment to a term exceeding one year, may not be granted or have renewed access to 
classified information.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> I resolve Guideline J against the Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under Guideline J,  I conclude that Disqualifying Conditions a, b, and c apply because Applicant's conduct did involve three criminal offenses over several 
years, including the one that resulted in the sentence of one to ten years. Applicant has not offered any evidence to rebut the Government's case regarding his 
criminal conduct. No Mitigating Conditions apply.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P>
