The Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions about Applicant's failure to disclose his numerous contacts with representatives of foreign governments are arbitrary and  capricious and not sustainable.

<P>Administrative Judge John R. Erck issued a decision, dated June 18, 2002, in which he concluded it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant did not falsify a personnel 
security questionnaire; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred by applying Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1.  For the reasons that follow, the 
Board reverses the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated February 12, 2002.  The SOR was based on Guideline B 
(Foreign Influence), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).</P> 
 
<P>A hearing was held on May 23, 2002.  The Administrative Judge issued a written decision, dated June 18, 2002, in which he: (a) entered formal findings in 
favor of Applicant with respect to Guideline B and Guideline E; and (b) concluded it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the Board on Department Counsel's appeal of the Judge's favorable security clearance decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 
2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 
87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P>

<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant did not falsify a personnel security questionnaire</SPAN>.  There is no dispute about the following 
facts: (a) From 1995 to 1997, Applicant worked as an intern at an institute in the United States, and in that capacity he had regular or frequent contacts with 
foreign military personnel and other representatives of foreign governments; (b) Applicant completed a security questionnaire in July 1998; (c) Applicant 
answered "NO" to Question 14 on the security questionnaire<A HREF="01-20906.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
<P>; and (d) Applicant's "NO" answer to Question 14 was incorrect.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge found that Applicant's "NO" answer to Question 14 was not a falsification.  On appeal, Department Counsel contends the 
Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant's answer to Question 14 was not a falsification.  In support of this contention, Department Counsel argues the 
Administrative Judge erred because:</P> 
 
<P>(a) in finding Applicant did not engage in falsification, the Judge relied on a narrow reading of Question 14 that is contrary to its plain language;</P> 
 
<P>(b) in finding that Applicant "erroneously interpreted" Question 14, the Judge acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner because that finding accepts a reading 
of Question 14 by Applicant that is contrary to its plain language;</P> 
 
<P>(c) the record evidence as a whole does not support the Judge's acceptance of Applicant's assertion that he answered "NO" to Question 14 with innocent intent; 
and</P> 
 
<P>(d) the Judge's finding is based on applying a standard that allows Applicant to substitute his personal judgment of what is relevant and material information for 
the judgment of the federal government.</P> 
 
<P>In reply, Applicant responds to Department Counsel's appeal arguments and contends the Board should sustain the Judge's finding that he did not falsify the 
personnel security questionnaire by answering "NO" to Question 14.  For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes Department Counsel's claim of error is 
persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel persuasively argues that the Administrative Judge acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by making a finding of no falsification based 
on a reading of Question 14 that is contrary to its plain language and intent.  The Administrative Judge stated that "Question 14 is written to elicit the broadest 
possible response; the Government wants applicants for security clearance to disclose <EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">all</SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> contacts with representative[s] of foreign governments, except for 
those contacts that are specifically identified as being excluded.  The Government, not an applicant, is responsible for deciding if there has been a foreign 
contact that warrants further inquiry"  (Decision at p. 8)(emphasis in original).  However, the Judge then proceeded to analyze Applicant's "NO" answer to 
Question 14 and Applicant's explanation for that "NO" answer in terms inconsistent with his characterization about the scope and purpose of Question 14.  
Specifically, the Judge found Applicant's "NO" answer was not a falsification because: (a) there is no evidence that Applicant had contacts with representatives 
of foreign governments "that he wanted or needed to conceal in order to be granted a security clearance"; and (b) "Applicant erroneously interpreted [Question 
14] as requiring him to report only foreign contacts that were more substantive than the superficial contacts he had while employed at Institute X" (Decision at 
p. 8).  Given the plain language of Question 14, and the government's strong interest in obtaining complete and accurate information to conduct a thorough 
background investigation of an applicant, the Judge's statement about the scope and purpose of Question 14 is correct.  However, it was arbitrary and capricious 
for the Judge to evaluate Applicant's "NO" answer to Question 14 and Applicant's explanation for his "NO" answer in a manner contrary to the plain language, 
scope, and purpose of Question 14.<A HREF="01-20906.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
<P>Department Counsel also persuasively argues that, under the reasonable person standard,<A HREF="01-20906.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
<P> Applicant knew or should have known that his numerous contacts 
with representatives of foreign governments while he was an intern required him to answer "YES" to Question 14.  The record evidence shows that when 
Applicant worked as an intern, he had regular or frequent contacts with numerous foreign military personnel and other representatives of foreign governments.  
Considering the fact that Applicant completed the security questionnaire within a year after he had completed his internship, it is simply not credible for 
Applicant to claim he believed he did not need to report his</P> 
 
<P>numerous contacts with representatives of foreign governments in response to the plain language of Question 14.<A HREF="01-20906.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> 
<P>Department Counsel also contends the Administrative Judge erred by accepting Applicant's explanation for his "NO" answer to Question 14 because there is 
record evidence that shows Applicant has a propensity for untruthfulness and deception.  In support of this contention, Department Counsel points to the record 
evidence that shows Applicant was found guilty of academic dishonesty for cheating on an assignment, and he had a history of making illegal, pirated copies of 
computer software for his personal use.  Department Counsel argues that record evidence makes it implausible for the Judge to accept Applicant's claim that he 
erroneously interpreted Question 14.  In reply, Applicant argues the conduct cited by Department Counsel does not prove a pattern of dishonesty that shows 
Applicant intentionally lied when he answered "NO" to Question 14.  The Judge specifically concluded that Applicant's academic dishonesty and his making 
illegal, pirated copies of computer software "demonstrated questionable judgment, a lack of candor, dishonesty, and an unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations" (Decision at p. 7).<A HREF="01-20906.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 
<P>  However, having reached that adverse conclusion, the Judge appears to have ignored it when making findings and conclusions 
about Applicant's alleged falsification.  Prior dishonest conduct is material and relevant, under the whole person concept, to evaluate whether an applicant's 
incorrect answer to a question on a security questionnaire was the result of innocent mistake or deliberate falsification.  Reading the Judge's decision as a 
whole, the Board concludes the Judge considered Applicant's conduct in a piecemeal fashion that is inconsistent with the requirements of the Directive.  <EM>See, 
e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0601 (January 30, 2001) at p. 8 ("Under the whole person concept, an Administrative Judge must assess the totality of an applicant's 
conduct and circumstances in order to evaluate the applicant's security eligibility, not just consider an applicant's conduct and circumstances in a piecemeal 
manner.").</P> 
 
<P>In arguing that the Administrative Judge's favorable decision should be affirmed, Applicant correctly notes the Administrative Judge also reasoned that 
Applicant's "NO" answer to Question 14 was not a falsification because "If Applicant had had substantive foreign contacts which were of a security concern, 
information about them would have surfaced during the earlier interviews when he disclosed cheating in college and copying computer software, or during his 
recent DoD background investigation" (Decision at p. 8).  Applicant's reliance on this reason is misplaced.  There is no factual or logical connection between 
Applicant's intent or state of mind when he answered "NO" to Question 14 and what federal investigators later discovered or failed to discover during their 
investigation of Applicant.  Whether Applicant's answer to Question 14 was the result of innocent mistake or misunderstanding, or the result falsification, turns 
on Applicant's intent or state of mind when he completed the security questionnaire, not the actions or inactions of the investigators conducting his background 
investigation.  Furthermore, the Judge's statement is arbitrary and capricious because it is inconsistent with the Judge's own characterization of the plain 
language, scope and purpose of Question 14.  Accordingly, the Judge's statement, cited by Applicant on appeal, does not provide a rational basis for the Judge's 
finding that no falsification occurred.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant also urges the Board to reject Department Counsel's appeal arguments because: (a) Applicant's contacts with foreigners during his internship were 
superficial and not material; and (b) there is no record evidence that any of Applicant's contacts with foreigners during his internship led to any relationship 
between Applicant and a foreign national.  These arguments are  unpersuasive.  First, Applicant's arguments run contrary to the plain language, scope and 
purpose  of Question 14.  As discussed earlier in this decision, Question 14 is broadly worded and cannot reasonably be interpreted in the narrow manner 
proposed by Applicant's appeal argument.  The Board declines to accept an argument that would have the practical effect of allowing applicants to justify 
answering questions on a security questionnaire in a manner that ignores the plain language of those questions and undercuts the federal government's strong 
interest in obtaining information relevant to a background investigation.  Second, Applicant's arguments are based on reasoning that is inconsistent with the 
broad scope of materiality in security clearance investigations.  For purposes of falsification cases, materiality is not limited to information that would result in 
an adverse security clearance adjudication, but rather also covers information that is relevant to a security clearance investigation.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-06870 (September 13, 2002) at pp. 5-6.  Regardless of what an investigation of Applicant's contacts with representatives of foreign governments might 
produce, the federal government had a strong interest in knowing about those contacts so that it could make reasoned decisions in connection with its 
background investigation of Applicant and its adjudication of his security eligibility.<A HREF="01-20906.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by applying Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge applied Personal Conduct 
itigating Condition 1<A HREF="01-20906.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> 
<P> based on his conclusion that Applicant's "NO" answer to Question 14 "was not a concealment of information pertinent to a 
determination of Applicant's judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability" (Decision at p. 8).  Department Counsel contends the Judge erred because: (a) Personal 
Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 was not applicable to the facts and circumstances of Applicant's case; and (b) because Applicant's falsification of Question 14 
fell under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 2,<A HREF="01-20906.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> 
<P> the Judge should have considered whether other Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions were 
applicable.  Applicant contends Department Counsel's argument concerning Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 is wrong because: (i) "nothing in 
Guideline E dictates which mitigating condition to use against a disqualification"; and (ii) it would be "unjust" to deny an applicant the availability of the 
defense afforded by Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1.</P> 
 
<P>The Board rejects Department Counsel's argument to the extent it suggests that application of Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 can never be 
appropriate in a case involving an allegation of falsification.  Applicant is correct in noting that nothing in the Adjudicative Guidelines specifies how an 
adjudicator is to decide what mitigating conditions may be applied in a given case to mitigate the negative security implications of disqualifying conditions 
applicable to the facts and circumstances of an applicant's case.  However, the absence of such a specific rule does not leave an adjudicator unfettered 
discretion in applying the Adjudicative Guidelines for or against clearance.<A HREF="01-20906.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> 
<P>  Rather, an adjudicator must:</P> 
 
<P>(a) evaluate the possible applicability of disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the pertinent Adjudicative Guidelines according to their plain 
meaning;<A HREF="01-20906.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> 
<P>(b) assess the applicability of particular disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the pertinent Adjudicative Guidelines in terms of other relevant 
provisions of the Directive;<A HREF="01-20906.a1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> 
<P>(c) apply provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines in a manner that is consistent with the adjudicator's obligation to render an overall commonsense decision 
based on consideration of an applicant's security eligibility under the whole person concept;<A HREF="01-20906.a1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> 
<P> and</P> 
 
<P>(d) construe and apply provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines in a manner consonant with the "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard.<A HREF="01-20906.a1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> 
<P>Accordingly, the application of Adjudicative Guidelines for or against clearance is not reducible to a simple formula, but rather requires an adjudicator to 
exercise sound judgment within the parameters set by the Directive when deciding which Adjudicative Guidelines for or against clearance are applicable to a 
given case.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, the Administrative Judge's application of Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 was arbitrary and capricious because: (i) the falsification 
allegation was substantiated; and (ii) the information Applicant failed to disclose when he answered "NO" to Question 14 was pertinent to a determination of 
his judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability.  Accordingly, the Board finds persuasive Department Counsel's argument that Personal Conduct Mitigating 
Condition 1 is  not applicable to the facts and circumstances of Applicant's case.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel has demonstrated error below that warrants reversal.  Pursuant to Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.33.3, the Board 
reverses the Administrative Judge's favorable security clearance decision.</P>
