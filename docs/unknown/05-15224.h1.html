<P>During the time she was the sole support of her family, Applicant and her then husband incurred significant debt, primarily related to car purchases. Applicant has made some nominal payments on

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On January 19, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), 
dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. 
DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. On February 6, 2006, Applicant submitted a 
notarized response to the allegations. She requested a hearing. </P> 
 
<P>This matter was assigned to another administrative judge on February 27, 2006, but reassigned to me on April 24, 2006 because of caseload considerations. A notice of hearing was issued on May 5, 
2006, and a hearing was held on May 24, 2006. Four government exhibits and Applicant exhibits A through F were admitted into evidence. The record was held open until June 13, 2006 to allow 
Applicant time to submit additional evidence. The additional evidence was received. The government did not object to the admission of this evidence, which has been admitted as Applicant 
Exhibits G through K.<A HREF="05-15224.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant and two witnesses testified. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on June 2, 2006.</P>

</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines 
as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the adjudicative process 
provision in Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. </P> 
 
<P>Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or 
against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security clearance 
decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and 
seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.<A HREF="05-15224.h1.html#N_77_"><SUP> (77)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.<A HREF="05-15224.h1.html#N_78_"><SUP> (78)</SUP></A> The government has 
the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="05-15224.h1.html#N_79_"><SUP> (79)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="05-15224.h1.html#N_80_"><SUP> (80)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against her.<A HREF="05-15224.h1.html#N_81_"><SUP> (81)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable 
clearance decision.<A HREF="05-15224.h1.html#N_82_"><SUP> (82)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance,<A HREF="05-15224.h1.html#N_83_"><SUP> (83)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="05-15224.h1.html#N_84_"><SUP> (84)</SUP></A> Any reasonable 
doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information.<A HREF="05-15224.h1.html#N_85_"><SUP> (85)</SUP></A> Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 
specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned." The 
decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.<A HREF="05-15224.h1.html#N_86_"><SUP> (86)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not 
met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations - Guideline F: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is often linked 
to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline F. Applicant has a history of excessive debt, including medical bills, which have not been paid. Applicant's financial problems clearly fall 
within the Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions E2.A6.1.2.1. (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and E2.A6.1.2.3. (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>).</P> 
 
<P>A security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated in several ways. Applicant's debt problems have been ongoing for a number of years, are recent, and are not an isolated incident. 
Thus, she has not established a mitigating condition under Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.1. (<EM>The behavior was not recent)</EM> and E2.A6.1.3.2. (<EM>It was an isolated 
incident).</EM> Although she has talked with creditors about a payment plan, she has not presented clear indications that her financial problems are being resolved. Thus, FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (<EM>The 
person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control</EM>) does not apply.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has made recent and nominal efforts towards the resolution of her debt. While she is not required to pay all her debt, she has not yet established a track record for resolving her 
outstanding debt. She has started on the road to financial health and is managing her current bills. For the government's concerns about her past debt to resolve, she needs to establish that she has 
worked with her creditors and set up a payment plan, or consolidate her smaller debts into a payment plan which she can manage. Because she has many unpaid debts, most of which are small, FC 
C E2.A6.1.3.5. (<EM>The individual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve </EM>debts) does not apply. Since her divorce, she has lived within her financial means. She 
does not over use her credit card nor does she open and use multiple store credit accounts. She understands her financial limitations. Her testimony regarding her goals to resolve her debts over time 
is credible. However, the Appeal Board has stated that promises to pay one's debts in the future are not a substitute for a clear record of debts actually paid.<A HREF="05-15224.h1.html#N_87_"><SUP> (87)</SUP></A> In determining an individual's security 
worthiness, the Government cannot rely on the possibility that she may resolve her outstanding debts at some future date.<A HREF="05-15224.h1.html#N_88_"><SUP> (88)</SUP></A> She has not mitigated the Government's concerns regarding her past 
debts. Guideline F is found against of Applicant.</P>
