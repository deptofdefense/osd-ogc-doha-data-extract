<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On November 5, 2004, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), pursuant to Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 25, 2005, after the hearing, Administrative 
Judge Phillip S. Howe granted Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and 
E3.1.30. </P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel raised the following  issues on appeal:  whether the Administrative Judge's findings of fact that certain debts had been paid were contrary 
to the record evidence; whether the Judge's favorable security clearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law; and whether the Judge's whole-person analysis is unsustainable because the considerations </P> 
 
<P>relied upon were unsupported by the record evidence and their application was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  We affirm the Administrative Judge's 
decision to grant the clearance.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Whether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge's Factual Findings</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge made the following relevant findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a widower with one child.  Applicant retired from the Air Force in 1995.  His retirement was due, in part, to his desire to care for his wife, who 
was battling cancer at that time.  In 1987, Applicant's wife had won a million dollar judgment based on her  medical condition.  Part of that money was used to 
help pay for her care in a nursing home.  Applicant's wife also used part of the money for a house and a car that she bequeathed to her parents.  At the time of 
her death in 1997, the judgment fund had been reduced to $200,000, which Applicant's wife bequeathed to her parents.  Applicant sued to take against the will, 
but received only $30,000 in cash and $7,000 in securities.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant began having financial difficulties in 1995.  He began looking for work when his wife died.  He did not find steady, well-paid employment until 
2002.  He filed for bankruptcy in July 2003, but was not satisfied with the amount of the monthly payment required of him.  The bankruptcy was dismissed, and 
Applicant filed for bankruptcy again in July 2004.  Applicant began making the required monthly payment of $2,504 to the bankruptcy trustee and continued to 
do so as of the date of the hearing.  </P> 
 
<P>At the time of the hearing, Applicant had no credit cards and was paying his current debts in a timely manner.  Applicant owes two debts totaling over $7,300 
for state income tax which he continues to dispute.  Some of Applicant's remaining debts were medical in nature.  He had expected at least one of those to be 
paid from his wife's estate, but it was not.  He paid that debt, a total of $745, in July and August 2005.  He paid one medical debt of $77 on July 1, 2005 and 
made one payment of $500 toward another medical debt in September 2005.  One medical debt of $642 remains unpaid.  On July 1, 2005, Applicant paid 
another debt of $121, although it was listed in his bankruptcy petition.  Applicant claimed to have paid a debt of $143, but had no proof.  Debts of $394 and $51 
remain unpaid, and Applicant disputes a debt of $187. </P> 
 
<P>Discussion</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge's findings of fact will be discussed along with his ultimate conclusions.         </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Whether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge's Ultimate Conclusions</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>An Administrative Judge is required to "examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for" the decision "including a 'rational connection 
between the facts found and the choice made.'" <EM>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., </EM>463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) 
(quoting <EM>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,</EM> 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge's decision to grant, 
deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive &para; E3.1.32.3.  Our scope of review under this standard is narrow, 
and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the Administrative Judge.  We may not set aside an Administrative Judge's decision "that is rational, based 
on consideration of the relevant factors, and within the scope of the authority delegated to the agency. . ."  <EM>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n,</EM> 463 U.S. at 42.  We 
review matters of law <EM> de novo.</EM></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel argues that the Administrative Judge's findings of fact that certain debts had been paid were contrary to the record evidence.  That 
argument is not persuasive.  Applicant testified that he had taken steps to reduce his indebtedness and was continuing to do so.  When given extra time to 
provide documentation, Applicant submitted some evidence to support his testimony.  The Judge accepted Applicant's testimony and additional evidence.  The 
factual errors of the Judge pertaining to two minor debts are too insubstantial to warrant overturning the Judge.  In accordance with the Directive, the Board 
defers to the Judge's credibility determinations in this case.  <EM>See </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.32.1.  </P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel next argues that the Administrative Judge's favorable security clearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  
Specifically, Department Counsel restates his argument regarding the Judge's findings of fact discussed above and contends that the Judge erred in applying 
Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions 1<A HREF="03-11888.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and 6.<A HREF="03-11888.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  That argument is not persuasive.  Applicant testified that he is paying his current obligations in a 
timely manner, and he presented testimony in mitigation of his past financial difficulties.  It was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to 
give Applicant some credit for that mitigating testimony.  The Judge believed that Applicant had taken significant steps to improve his financial situation and 
was making payments under his bankruptcy plan.  Applicant was not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he had completely paid off his indebtedness.  
Department Counsel has not shown that the Judge's favorable decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  <EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2-3 
(App. Bd. July 6, 2006). </P> 
 
<P>Finally, Department Counsel argues that the Judge's whole-person analysis is unsustainable because the considerations relied on were unsupported by the 
record evidence and their application was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  The discussion above applies to this argument as well.  Department 
Counsel is essentially arguing that the record evidence shows that Applicant was not as diligent about dealing with his financial problems as he could have 
been.  However, the unfavorable record evidence cited by Department Counsel is not sufficient to demonstrate the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, 
capricious, or contrary to law.  As the trier of fact, the Judge had to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighed the 
unfavorable evidence, or <EM>vice versa.</EM>  Department Counsel's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the 
Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  In this case, Applicant had filed for bankruptcy to settle debts which 
had accumulated for reasons beyond his control.  Apart from unpaid state income tax obligations which he disputes, Applicant's outstanding debts are minor in 
amount, and there is evidence he initiated a good-faith effort to settle the remaining debts.  Also he demonstrated a substantial improvement in his financial 
position.  The Board need not agree with the Judge's decision under Guideline F to conclude that it is sustainable.</P>
