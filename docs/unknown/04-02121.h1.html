<P>Applicant, a native of the People's Republic of China (PRC), came to the United States (U.S.) for graduate studies in August 1989, and became a U.S. 
naturalized citizen in September 2002. Foreign influence concerns persist where his father and siblings, whom he contacts monthly and visited in 1995, 1999, 
and 2002, are resident citizens of the PRC. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On March 14, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="04-02121.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> DOHA  recommended referral to an administrative judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should 
be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The SOR was based on foreign influence (Guideline B).</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>On March 22, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 
June 10, 2005, and on that date I scheduled a hearing for June 23, 2005, Applicant having waived the 15-day notice requirement. At the hearing, two 
government exhibits were admitted, and Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript received on July 6, 2005.</P> 
<P>At the government's request, I agreed to take official notice of several publications: the U.S. State Department's <EM>Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2004 China (includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau)</EM> dated February 28, 2005; the State Department's <EM>Background Note: China, </EM>dated March 2005; a 
Congressional Research Service issue brief titled <EM>Intelligence Issues for Congress</EM>, dated February 1, 2005; a Congressional Research Service report titled<EM> 
China-U.S. Relations: Current Issues and Implications for U.S. Policy</EM>, dated March 24, 2005; excerpts from a declassified redacted version of a report of the 
U.S. House Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of China dated January 3, 1999; the 
National Counterintelligence Center's <EM>Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage </EM>for 2000; and an article reporting 
on the Defense Personnel Security Research Center's Espionage Database Project titled <EM>Espionage by the Numbers: A Statistical Overview</EM>.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The SOR alleges foreign influence concerns because Applicant's father, siblings (a brother and a sister), and parents-in-law are resident citizens of the PRC, he 
sent his father $500 over the past five years, and he traveled to the PRC in July 1995, July 1999, and June 2002. Applicant admitted the allegations, which are 
accepted as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following 
additional findings:</P> 
<P><STRONG>Applicant's background</STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 43-year-old senior scientist employed by a defense contractor since October 2002. Applicant seeks a secret-level security clearance.</P> 
<P>A native of the PRC, Applicant was raised by his grandmother with his two siblings (an older sister and younger brother) in a small town about 500 miles south 
of Beijing until middle school, when he was sent to boarding school. His father, who worked as an accountant and retail store manager until he retired, lived in 
another village during Applicant's youth, and Applicant saw him once a month. Applicant's mother worked in retail when she was young, but with the Cultural 
Revolution of the mid to late 1960s, she left the job to work on the farm. Applicant attended college and three years of graduate study in the PRC, with most of 
the costs borne by the state. In January 1986, he married a PRC native citizen whom he met in college, and they had a daughter in June 1987.</P> 
<P>Applicant was accepted for graduate study by a university in the U.S. in 1987. He decided to wait a semester to commence his studies abroad because of his 
spouse's pregnancy. Financial aid became unavailable, forcing him to take the entrance exams again. Applicant, his spouse, and daughter eventually came to the 
U.S. in August 1989 where he pursued graduate study in nuclear particle (subatomic) physics. In December 1993, he earned his doctorate degree. For the next 
two years, he did postdoctoral work at a research facility in Canada. In July 1995, Applicant went to the PRC for about six weeks. He attended an international 
conference for one week, gave two lectures on particle physics at a PRC university at the invitation of the Chinese university, and then spent the remainder of 
his time with his in-laws and his father. From September 1996 to June 1999, Applicant was a postdoctoral research associate at a prestigious technical 
university in the U.S.</P> 
<P>In June 1999, Applicant changed career fields from theoretical physics to computer science, due to the limited opportunities available in subatomic physics. His 
spouse had just graduated from a local university and his daughter was to enter middle school that Fall, and he did not want to uproot them. For eleven months, 
he worked as a software engineer for a small company involved in laser medical applications. He then joined a software company in May 2000 as a 
development support engineer.</P> 
<P>In June 2002, Applicant traveled to the PRC with his spouse and daughter for tourism and to visit his parents-in-law and father. While he was in the PRC, he 
contacted the professor who had served as his faculty advisor for his master's degree and who had facilitated Applicant's lectures at the PRC university in 1995. 
Applicant extended a luncheon invitation but they did not get together as Applicant became ill. The professor is now retired.</P> 
<P>On his return to the U.S. in July 2002, Applicant was laid off from his job and unemployed for about three months. Applicant and his spouse became U.S. 
naturalized citizens in September 2002, taking the oath to renounce all foreign allegiances, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and its laws, and to bear 
arms or perform noncombatant service or civilian service on behalf of the U.S. if required. Their acquisition of U.S. citizenship served to renounce their PRC 
citizenship.<A HREF="04-02121.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> In mid-October 2002, he started his current job. As a senior scientist for the defense contractor, he has performed theoretical work (as opposed to 
experiments), and run and tested computer code involving laser imaging of unmanned aerial vehicles and atmospheric corrections.</P> 
<P>Needing a secret-level security clearance for his duties, Applicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86) on December 19, 2002. He disclosed the 
PRC citizenship of his father, his siblings, and his parents-in-law, the PRC citizenship and U.S. legal residency of his daughter, and his possession of a PRC 
passport, issued in August 1999, that he used to travel to Canada in 2001 and the PRC in June 2002, before he became a U.S. citizen. As for the addresses of 
family members living in the PRC, Applicant was uncertain of the translation so elected to inaccurately indicate "UNKNOWN."</P> 
<P>In August 2003, Applicant was issued his U.S. passport, valid until August 2013. On December 24, 2003, Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security 
Service special agent about his foreign connections, including his possession of a PRC passport with an expiration date of August 30, 2004. Applicant denied 
any use of the foreign passport since becoming a U.S. citizen, as well as any exercise of dual citizenship, and he expressed a willingness to relinquish the 
foreign passport if required. Applicant provided the general areas where his relatives were living in the PRC, and he updated his daughter's citizenship status to 
reflect her U.S. naturalization in October 2003. As for foreign travel, Applicant disclosed previously unreported trips to the PRC for six weeks in July 1995 to 
attend an "educational conference" and to visit his family, and in June 1999 to see his family on the tenth anniversary of his mother's death. Applicant indicated 
he has monthly telephone contact with his father, brother, and sister, and twice yearly telephone contact with his in-laws. Over the past five years, he had sent 
his father a total of $500. Applicant denied any other financial assistance or contacts or associations with anyone else residing in a foreign country.</P> 
<P>In conjunction with a trip to the PRC planned for July 2005, Applicant applied in March 2005 for a visa to travel on his U.S. passport. At that time, a Chinese 
consular official invalidated Applicant's expired PRC passport, cutting the corner to obliterate the identification number.</P> 
<P>Applicant's father and siblings reside in the same area in the PRC. His brother is a manager in a small hotel. His brother's spouse is a clerk in a bookstore. 
Applicant's sister and her husband are engaged in accounting work. Applicant does not know whether or not they are privately employed or work for the local 
or county government. His sister's spouse travels within the local province for his job. Applicant had not sent his father any money since Chinese New Year 
2003, but he planned on visiting him in July 2005.</P> 
<P>Applicant's parents-in-law worked in a factory that manufactures cables before they retired in about 1982 and moved back to their hometown in the PRC. Her 
brother works in a brewery in the PRC. In June 2005, Applicant's spouse took their daughter to the PRC to visit her parents.</P> 
<P>Applicant intends to remain in the U.S. for the educational and work opportunities for his 18-year-old daughter, who had been accepted into an Ivy League 
university for the Fall semester 2005, and because his spouse "hated the system" in the PRC. Applicant's spouse is employed as a software engineer for a small 
firm in the U.S. Applicant has no financial assets in the PRC. He and his spouse own their home in the U.S.</P> 
<P><STRONG>PRC's political and economic state</STRONG></P> 
<P>On January 1, 1979, the U.S. formally recognized the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the sole legal government of China. The PRC is an authoritarian 
state with ultimate control of all state military, commercial, and political activities constitutionally vested in the Chinese Communist Party. As the country 
transitions from a centrally-planned economy to a market-based economy, the PRC has gained power and influence internationally while improving the living 
standard for its citizens. The PRC is now the third largest trading partner of the U.S. and has been an important partner in U.S. counterterrorism efforts since 
September 11, 2001.<A HREF="04-02121.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> PRC-U.S. relations are now "smoother" than they have been at any time since the Chinese suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests 
in 1989.<A HREF="04-02121.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>The PRC has a history of targeting U.S. intelligence, economic, and technical information, including dual use technology with an ostensibly civil purpose that 
can be integrated into the PRC military and industrial base. The PRC is known to blend intelligence and non intelligence assets and to rely on different 
collection methods (<EM>e.g</EM>., including illegal transfers of technology through a third country, joint ventures with foreign firms, scientific conferences) to obtain 
military and economic information.<A HREF="04-02121.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>As of late 2004, the PRC's human rights record remained poor. Citizens lacked the freedom to express opposition to the Chinese Communist Party-led political 
system and to change their national leaders or form of government. In violation of internationally recognized norms, the PRC continued its crackdown on 
independent writers, religious organizations, and political dissenters,  harassing, detaining, and in some cases imprisoning, those perceived as threatening 
central government authority or national stability. Abuses included instances of torture and mistreatment of prisoners, coerced confessions, arbitrary arrest and 
detention, and even extrajudicial killings. The PRC prosecuted individuals for subversion and leaking state secrets as a means to harass and intimidate, and 
infringed on individuals' right to privacy.<A HREF="04-02121.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> As of March 2005, the U.S. was concerned about the PRC's track record of weapon sales, technology transfers, and 
nuclear energy assistance to "rogue" nations (Iran and Syria) and the official adoption by the PRC's National People's Congress of an "anti-secession" law, 
aimed at reining in those who advocate independence for Taiwan.<A HREF="04-02121.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P>

</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the

. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete review of the evidence of record, the following adjudicative guideline is  most pertinent to an evaluation of Applicant's security suitability:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound 
by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure. (&para; E2.A2.1.1.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of the Applicant, I conclude the 
government has established its case with respect to Guideline B, foreign influence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father, his two siblings, and his  parents-in-law are resident citizens of his native PRC. Applicant contacts his family members about once a month, 
and he sent his father financial support to as recently as Chinese New Year 2003. He visited his family members in 1995, 1999, and 2002, and had another trip 
planned for July 2005. Furthermore, the DOHA Appeal Board has held it reasonable for the administrative judge to consider the significance not only of an 
applicant's ties, but also of his spouse's ties to a foreign country and the possible effect they may have on Applicant's contacts under Guideline B (<EM>see</EM> ISCR 
Case No. 01-02452, App. Bd. Nov. 21, 2002). Although Applicant speaks to his in-laws only about twice per year, he visited them in the PRC in 1995 and 
2002. While the frequency of his spouse's contacts with her parents is not of record, she and their daughter were in the PRC visiting her parents when his 
security clearance was held in June 2005. Disqualifying conditions &para; E2.A2.1.2.1. <EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close</EM> 
<EM>ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country, </EM>and &para; E2.A2.1.2.2. <EM>Sharing living quarters with a person or persons, 
regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists</EM>, apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The foreign influence concerns raised by these family connections in the PRC may be mitigated where it can be determined that they are not agents of a foreign 
power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the Applicant to choose between loyalty to them and the United States (<EM>see</EM> 
C &para; E2.A2.1.3.1.).<A HREF="04-02121.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Applicant's father was an accountant and retail store manager before he retired. His brother works in a beer-making factory (brewery). His 
parents-in-law worked in a factory that manufactures cables before their retirements in 1982. Applicant's sister and her husband are accountants. The evidence 
does not establish that his father, parents-in-law, or his brother is or ever was a foreign agent.<A HREF="04-02121.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Applicant's sister and her husband are employed in accounting, 
and the latter travels frequently within his province in the PRC for his work. Applicant denied knowledge of any PRC government connection, but was unable 
to rule it out.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even if none of his relations is a foreign agent, the inquiry in a foreign influence case is not limited to consideration of whether the foreign contacts or 
connections are agents of a foreign power. The foreign contacts or connections must also be evaluated in terms of whether they place an applicant in a position 
of vulnerability, even if there is no evidence that a foreign country has sought to exploit that vulnerability. (<EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0628, Feb. 24, 2003) As long 
as there is a tie of obligation or affection to a person who is subject to a foreign government's jurisdiction/laws and/or is within physical reach of the foreign 
authorities, undue foreign influence remains possible. Common sense suggests that the stronger the ties of affection or obligation, the more vulnerable a person 
is to being manipulated if the relative is improperly influenced, brought under control, or even used as a hostage by a foreign intelligence or security service.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although not specifically stated in the adjudicative guideline, the particular foreign country of which the close relative or associate is a citizen or resides is 
relevant in determining the likelihood of undue influence being brought to bear on its citizens/residents. Countries with strong democratic institutions and 
respect for the rule of law are generally regarded as presenting less of a risk than totalitarian regimes with a record of human rights abuses, support for terrorist 
activities, or hostility to the U.S. While relations between the U.S. and the PRC are reportedly "smoother" than they have been at any time since 1989, the PRC 
has a history of targeting U.S. intelligence and economic information, and it continues to have a poor human rights record against its own citizens.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In evaluating whether the risk of undue foreign influence is acceptable, the particular circumstances of each applicant must be taken into account. Applicant's 
academic accomplishments have not gone unnoticed by the PRC.  While in the PRC attending an international conference in 1995, Applicant gave two lectures 
at the PRC university where he had pursued his bachelor and master's degrees. These lectures were not part of the conference, and were at the request of the 
university. Applicant continued his contacts with his faculty advisor, a professor on staff of the PRC university, to at least 2002. When in the PRC to visit 
family members and tour the major cities with his daughter, Applicant extended a luncheon invitation to this professor, who has since retired. Applicant's 
switch of careers in the U.S. to computer software imaging does not eliminate the risk of his relatives (or even himself when he is in the PRC) being targeted. 
PRC authorities are known to arbitrarily interfere with the privacy of its citizens. Telephone conversations, facsimile transmissions, electronic mail and internet 
communications were routinely monitored, and even hotel guestrooms were bugged and searched at times for sensitive or propriety materials in 2004.<A HREF="04-02121.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has taken substantial steps toward establishing firm roots in the U.S. His acquisition of U.S. citizenship in September 2002 and of a U.S. passport in 
August 2003 are consistent with his intent to remain in the U.S., and he and his spouse are productively employed in the computer software field. However, he 
remains vulnerable to undue foreign influence through his family members in the PRC. None of the mitigating conditions apply. Accordingly, SOR &para;&para; 1.a., 1.b., 
1.c. and 1.d. are resolved against him.</SPAN></P>
