<P>Applicant, born in the Republic of China (Taiwan),  became a United States citizen in 1999.  He has four siblings, who are citizens of Taiwan and reside in 
Taiwan.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He has close and continuing contact</SPAN> with his brother, who has been a career soldier for the Taiwanese army, and since his retirement, continues to be 
employed by the Government of Taiwan. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence establishes that Applicant is vulnerable to foreign influence. </SPAN> Additionally, in a Security Clearance 
Application (SCA) supplied to the Government, Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> gave incorrect information</SPAN> regarding his military service and his employment  in Taiwan . Mitigation

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated October 20, 
2003, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct 
proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, or denied. The SOR was based on Foreign Influence (Guideline B) concerns because of the 
foreign residency and/or citizenship of close family members and Personal Conduct (Guideline E) concerns  regarding false information provided to the 
Government.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant<EM></EM> filed a notarized response dated November 18, 2003, to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative 
Judge. On January 29, 2004, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing, and pursuant to formal notice dated February 2, 2004, a hearing was held on 
arch 11, 2004. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered two documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1 and 2) and no witnesses were called. Applicant  offered four 
documentary exhibits (Exhibits A-D) and offered his own testimony. The transcript (TR) was received on March 30, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B (</SPAN>Foreign Influence<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) </SPAN> and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of 
the Directive. The SOR contains seven allegations, 1.a., through </SPAN>1.g.,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under Guideline B and two allegations, 2.a. and 2.b., under Guideline E. Applicant 
admitted SOR allegations 1.a. through 1.g.</SPAN> and denied 2. a. and 2.b.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testimony of 
Applicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 47 years old. He is employed as a senior engineer by a United States defense contractor that wants him to have a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was born in Taiwan. He came to the United States in 1984. He became a <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> naturalized </SPAN>United States citizen in 1994. He is married and has two 
daughters. Both children were born in the United States and are United States citizens. He received a Masters degree in Electrical Engineering in 1985 from a 
United States university.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1 Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has three sisters and one brother, who are citizens of and reside in Taiwan.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> His brother and one sister are employed by the Government of Taiwan. 
His brother was in the Taiwanese army for at least twenty years, and he retired as a colonel in 1998.  His current employment for the Government of Taiwan 
involves  attempting to aid veterans in finding employment (Tr at 39-41).  </SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> communicates with his brother  through email on a monthly basis. He 
indicated that his brother plans to retire and eventually move to the United States (Response to SOR). Applicant's contact with his three sisters is infrequent (Tr 
at 57-59).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant </SPAN>has <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">traveled to Taiwan in the years 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2002. These trips were primarily family related</SPAN>.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From 1978 to1980</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant served as a lieutenant in the Navy of Taiwan</SPAN>. He also was employed by two different companies in Taiwan, the first in 1979, and 
the second from approximately 1980 to 1983.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant completed a signed, sworn<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> SCA</SPAN> on April 25, 2002<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Question #11 asks, "Have you ever served in the military? (If yes, provide in chronological order 
your military history: begin with the most recent period and include in chronological order your military history: begin with the most recent period and include 
Reserves, National Guard, Merchant Marines, and Foreign Military Service.)"  He answered "No" to this question.  As discussed above, Applicant served in the 
Navy of Taiwan from 1978 to1980, and the correct answer should have been yes. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question #13 asks,  "Are you now or have you ever been employed by or acted as a consultant for a foreign government, firm or agency?" </SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> also 
answered "No" to this question. Clearly, </SPAN> since Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> had worked for two separate Taiwanese companies, he should have answered yes to this question.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN> considered<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN>The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2).</SPAN>  </P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following guidelines and concerns most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>FOREIGN INFLUENCE (GUIDELINE B) </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>PERSONAL CONDUCT </STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>(GUIDELINE E)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.1. <EM></EM></SPAN>The Concern<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </P> 
 
<P>the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, 
influence or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established a 
reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of Guideline B (Foreign Influence)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN>Applicant has four siblings,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> who are citizens of and reside in</SPAN> Taiwan. 
His brother has been a career soldier for the Taiwanese army, and since his retirement he continues to be employed by the Government of Taiwan. The Taiwan 
citizenship and residency of Applicant's family members create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information 
because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to 
require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for him.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>  The evidence of existence of <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">immediate family members</SPAN>, who are citizens of and reside in Taiwan comes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1, 
immediate family members, or  persons to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, who are citizens of, or resident in, a foreign country. 
DC E2.A2.1.2.3 also applies because two of Applicant's siblings are connected with the Government of Taiwan.</P> 
 
<P>I cannot conclude that any Mitigating Condition (MC) applies under Guideline B. </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>         With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant failed to provide complete information to the Government in response to questions  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"># 
11 and 13,</SPAN> on the SCA that he executed on April 25, 2002. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's explanation for his failure to include information about his military service and 
employment history in Taiwan is that his English language skills were not very strong, and as a result he thought the questions only were asking him about the 
period after he became a United States citizen, which in this case was in 1994 (Tr at 50-53). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I cannot conclude that Applicant's explanation is reasonable. While English is Applicant's second language, at the time he completed his SCA in 2002, he had 
lived in the United States for eighteen years, and during that time he had received an advanced degree from a United States university. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The wording of both 
questions was unambiguous, and there was nothing in either question that indicated the Government was only interested in the period after Applicant became a 
citizen of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Therefore, I find that when Applicant answered the SCA, he knew or should have known that the Government was interested in his entire history, not only the 
time since he became a United States citizen.</P> 
 
<P>In reviewing the DCs  under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC E2.A5.1.2.2. applies<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, because </SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>provided information in his SCA that he knew or should 
have known was not correct.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I fond that no MC applies. </SPAN>I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance.</SPAN></P>
