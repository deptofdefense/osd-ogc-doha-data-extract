</P>

<P>	The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865
and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended by
Change 3, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated February 5, 1997, to the Applicant which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and
determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</P>

<P>	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</P>

<P>	On February 24, 1997, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR and
requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on March 18, 1997. A notice of hearing was
issued on March 24, 1997, and the case was heard on April 9, 1997.  At the hearing, held as
scheduled, three Government exhibits (Gov Ex) and no Applicant exhibits (App Ex) were admitted
into evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant. A transcript of the hearing was received
by this office on April 22, 1997. </P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of the same, I make the following findings of fact:</P>

<P>	Applicant has worked for a defense contractor for 17 years, since 1980. Applicant has held 
a secret security clearance since March 1988.</P>

<P>	On October 21, 1991, Applicant was arrested and charged with battery and kidnaping.  The
action involved an incident with an ex-girl friend.  Applicant and the woman started dating in 1989
and became very close.  They cohabitated "off and on," at his apartment, between 1989 and 1991. 
Throughout their relationship they both dated other people. By early October 1991 the relationship
had turned stormy. The woman was keeping another residence, yet spending 4 to 5 days a week at
Applicant's apartment.</P>

<P>	In October 1991, Applicant was very frustrated with the relationship and heartbroken. 
Applicant became upset with the woman's lying and her unwillingness to proceed or relinquish the
relationship.  The two agreed to meet to try to work out the problems in their relationship.  They
were to meet on Friday, October 18, 1991.  The woman did not arrive for the meeting on Friday,
Saturday or Sunday.  On Sunday night/Monday morning, the night of October 20-21, 1991,
Applicant did not sleep.  On Monday morning, October 21, 1991, Applicant drove to the woman's
place of work to talk with her. Applicant confronted the woman in the parking lot.  Applicant was
upset and yelling.  After arguing with the woman for a few minutes he grabbed her and pulled her
into his car.  She was crying.  </P>

<P>	He drove the woman to his apartment so that she could remove her personal things from the
apartment.  During the 10 minute drive the woman asked him to stop but he continued to drive.  At
the apartment the argument continued.  Applicant gave the woman her clothes and other personal
goods, which she had kept in the apartment.  During the argument Applicant squirted the woman's
dress and hair with chocolate syrup.  After the argument the woman took a shower while here clothes
were being washed. After taking a shower the woman called her place of work.  The police were at
her place of work. Both the woman and Applicant talked to the police on the telephone.  A few
minutes later the police came by the apartment and arrested the Applicant. </P>

<P>	Applicant pled guilty to kidnaping and, under the First Offenders Act, was fined $1,150.00,
ordered to receive psychiatric counseling, and to have no contact with the woman or her family, and
was sentenced to 5 years probation.  He also pled guilty to simple battery for the same incident for
which he was sentenced to 12 months probation. The court order states: upon fulfillment of the terms
of probation the Applicant shall stand discharged of the offenses charged and shall be completely
exonerated of guilt of those offenses charges. (Gov Ex 2)  For the first 2 years of probation Applicant
had to report to his probation officer once a month.  In 1994, probation was changed to unsupervised
probation.  Probation will end in May 1997.  </P>

<P>	Applicant has not seen the woman since the incident.  Following the incident Applicant
received counseling for a year to a year and a half. Initially, he saw the counselor 2 to 3 times a
month.  Counseling was later reduced to once a month.  Applicant's last session with the counselor
was in December 1993.  Applicant talked about his temper.  At the time of the incident he was 32-years-old and had what he called "a short fuse."  Applicant's jealousy was also instrumental in
causing the incident.  He lost control of his temper and himself.  Applicant believes his gross error
in judgment was caused by his broken heart and because he was an insecure person. The counselor
also suggested he attend Adult Children of Alcoholics (ACOA) meetings.  He began attending these
ACOA meeting in May 1992 and continues to attend.  </P>

<P>	Since the incident, Applicant realizes he can only make himself change and cannot force
others to change their ways.  On July 1, 1995, Applicant married and has experienced no marital
problems. </P>

<P>	Applicant had self-employment earnings that he failed to include on his federal and state tax
returns.  Applicant has always included his income paid him as an employee of a defense contractor
on his tax returns, but he failed to include his self-employment earnings.  Applicant failed to report
this income because he believed the expenses of generating the income exceeded the amount of
money he made. </P>

<P>	In 1989 Applicant had serious sinus problems<A HREF="97-0071.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> which resulted in his termination<A HREF="97-0071.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> from work
with the defense contractor. The largest of all of his self-employment earnings occurred during the
time he was away from his job at the defense contractor company. In 1989 he power washed 195
condominiums, for which he was paid $2,500.  From the $2,500 he received, he paid an assistant
$800.00 for helping him with this job.  The $1,700 remaining did not cover his additional costs.  In
order to do the job Applicant purchased a pressure washer machine (power washer) at a cost of
$1,900. [Tr 82], a ladder, brushes, work clothes, drop clothes, hoses, and other tools.  Additionally,
he had to purchase 200 to 300 gallons of bleach in order to wash the condominiums.  Neither the
income nor the expenses related to this part-time job were reported on Applicant's income tax
returns for 1989.</P>

<P>	During the period of 1989 to 1991, Applicant also did part-time work sporadically as a
mechanic for a friend who owned a lube shop.  During these years he was paid a total of $2,000 to
$3,000, by check, for work listed as "contract labor."  Applicant used this money to buy tools<A HREF="97-0071.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>.  He
did not report this income or expenses on his tax returns for those years. </P>

<P>	During 1995 he was paid $350 to paint sheetrock in a house being built.  In order to do the
painting he purchased a $500 paint machine, brushes, tips, and other equipment, and incurred
transportation costs.  In 1996 he had no income from outside sources.  In 1997 he had one outside
job for which he was paid $20. This $20 will be reported on his 1997 income tax returns.</P>

<P>	During the period 1989 to 1996 Applicant had purchased the power washer in 1989 for
$1,900 and when that power washer wore out, he purchased another power washer in 1994 for
$1,200.  During the period he purchased two<A HREF="97-0071.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> power painters costing approximately $500 each.  In
addition to the one assistant already mentioned, he paid another assistant more that $1,000 for
helping him on various part-time jobs. This amount came out of the money he was paid for the work
performed.  </P>

<P>	Applicant's intents to report this income and expenses to the IRS and the state Department
of Revenue. [Tr 61]</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U>POLICIES</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable
information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as
to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in
making the overall common sense determination required.  Each adjudicative decision must also
include an assessment of the seriousness, recency, frequency and motivation for an applicant's
conduct; the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with
knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; the age of the applicant; the absence or
presence of rehabilitation, the potential for coercion or duress, and the probability that the conduct
will or will not recur in the future.  <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section F.3. and Enclosure 2.  Because
each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the
factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. 
oreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an
unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a
recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable
behavior. </P>

<P>	 Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following
adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>CRIMINAL CONDUCT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>(Criterion J)</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability,
and trustworthiness.</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>(1)	Any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged.</P>

<P>	(2)	A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	</FONT>(1)	The criminal behavior was not recent.	</P>

<P>	(2) 	The crime was an isolated incident.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	(5)	There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * *</P>

<P>	In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination required, the
Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and
logical basis in the evidence of record.  In addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must
make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.  Decisions under the Directive include
consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or
inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</P>

<P><CENTER><U>Burden of Proof<STRONG></U></CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P>	Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden and establishes conduct cognizable as
a security concern under the Directive, then the applicant must remove that doubt with substantial
evidence  in explanation, mitigation, or extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that
despite the existence of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
or continue his security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the Government
raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy
burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands the Court's rationale, doubts are to be
resolved against the applicant.</P>

<P>	The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance
holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.  If an applicant has
demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in his private affairs, then there exists the possibility that
an applicant may demonstrate the same attitude toward security rules and regulations.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Applicant's failure to include self-employment earnings on his state and federal income tax
returns for tax years 1989 through 1995 is not criminal in nature.  His failure to include these
earnings may<A HREF="97-0071.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> subject him to a civil penalty, but does not subject him to a criminal penalty<A HREF="97-0071.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> under
the IRS code.  Applicant filed federal and state income tax returns for the years in question.  His
income as an employee of the defense contractor was reported on those returns and tax paid on that
income.  </P>

<P>	Even where a taxpayer may have fraudulently concealed income and may have done his best
to cheat the government, conviction for attempted evasion of tax cannot be supported in the absence
of showing that tax is actually due from the accused for the year involved.  <EM>See</EM> <U>Hold v. US</U> (1965,
CA9 Wash) 347 F2d 124.  There has been no showing that Applicant actually owed tax in excess
of the amount stated on his return. Tax evasion is, therefore, not shown in this particular case.</P>

<P>	To prove tax evasion, fraud, or willful failure to file a return, "willfulness" must be proved. 
A good faith belief by the taxpayer that he is not violating the law negates willfulness, whether or
not the claimed belief is objectively reasonable. <EM>See</EM> <U>Cheek v. US</U> (1991) 498 US 192, 112 LEd 617,
111 SCt 605. Applicant failed to report his self-employment earnings believing his expenses
exceeded the income received. Applicant's belief negates the required element of willfulness.</P>

<P>	In 1989 he received $2,500 to wash some condominiums.  His expenses exceeded his
income. He paid $1,900 for a new power washer, $800 to an assistant, and additional amounts for,
brushes, work clothes, drop clothes, hoses, a ladder, other tools, and 200 to 300 gallons of bleach. 
The record indicates Applicant was paid $2,000 to $3,000 as a mechanic working part-time from
1989 to 1991,  money he spent on buying more tools.  </P>

<P>	During the last three years, 1995-1997, his income from self-employment sources was
minimal.  He made $370 during these three years<A HREF="97-0071.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A>. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	During the period 1989 to 1996 Applicant had income from part-time jobs other than his job
with the defense contractor. But in addition to the expenses already mentioned during this period,
Applicant had purchased another power washer in 1994 for $1,200, a second power painter costing
approximately $500, and paid another assistant more that $1,000 for helping him. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Applicant did have self-employment income which he should have included on his federal
and state income tax returns.  Applicant's expenses incurred during this period may have resulted
in business losses on his self-employment income.  Still, Applicant had a duty to report his income
and expenses on the proper forms.  His failure to so report may subject him to a civil penalty, but
not a criminal penalty.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	Since Applicant's actions were not criminal, neither of the Disqualifying Factors (DF)<A HREF="97-0071.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A>
applies. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">With respect to SOR subparagraph 1.a., Criterion J, criminal conduct, the Government has not
established its case. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	With respect to the  kidnaping and battery the Government has established its case. The
evidence establishes that Applicant was arrested and pled guilty to the charges.  He was sentenced
under the First Offenders Act.  Upon fulfillment of the terms of probation<A HREF="97-0071.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A> the Applicant shall stand
discharged of the offenses charged and shall be completely exonerated of guilt of the offenses
charged.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	In assessing the current security significance of the battery and kidnaping, I must consider
the Adjudicative Guidelines pertaining to criminal conduct.  Mitigating condition (MC) 1 applies
since the event is not recent.  The event occurred in October 1991, some 5 &frac12; years before the
hearing.  MC 2<A HREF="97-0071.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP>(10)</SUP></A> also applies to this case.  This one hour incident is the sole manifestation of this
type of conduct evidenced at the hearing. The event was precipitated by a personal relationship gone
bad.  Applicant's broken heart, his immaturity, the anger he experienced during the three days
leading up to the event, and his lack of sleep the night prior to the incident, all were factors leading
to this event.  These factors combined and resulted in Applicant's pulling his ex-girlfriend into his
car and taking her against her will to the apartment in which they both lived.  Applicant's actions
were serious and wrong.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	MC 5<A HREF="97-0071.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP>(11)</SUP></A> applies to this incident since there is evidence of rehabilitation.  Following the event
Applicant received counseling.  He now knows he can't force another person to act the way he wants
them to act.  He knows he can only control how he acts.  This shows a more mature attitude.  Since
the incident he has not seen the woman.  He has married and leads his life in such a manner so
control his anger and to prevent such an event from ever recurring. Applicant has met his probational
requirements.  Applicant's present lifestyle is an indication of successful rehabilitation.  I find for
the Applicant as to the SOR subparagraph 1.b. </FONT></P>
