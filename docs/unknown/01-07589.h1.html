</P> 
 
<P>On August 23, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  In a sworn written statement, dated August 29, 2001, the Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR elected 
to have her case decided on a written record, in lieu of a hearing. </P> 
 
<P>The Applicant received a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) on October 8, 2001, and received an opportunity to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  The Applicant responded to the FORM on October 12, 2001<A NAME="date of FORM response or 30 days"></A>.  The 
Applicant's FORM response was admitted into evidence without objection on November 6, 2001.  The record in this case closed on November 
6, 2001.  The undersigned Administrative Judge received the case assignment on November 6, 2001<A NAME="date of case assignment/reassignment"></A>.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on the following two guidelines: paragraph 1, Guideline F (financial 
considerations), and paragraph 2, Guideline E (personal conduct).  The undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly reviewed the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, makes the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant is a 25-year-old word processor employed by a U.S. Government contractor and its predecessor company since October 1998.  
The Applicant seeks to obtain a personnel security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant graduated from high school in November 1994 and since then has obtained a bachelor's degree in business and is currently working 
on an MBA degree.  She was married in July 1996 and separated in August 1997.  She is currently living as a single parent of three children, ages 
7, 6, and 3.  She was unemployed for about three months at the end of 1995 and is working two jobs at the present time.  FORM items 4 and 8.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant currently has a gross annual salary of more than $32,000 and receives more than $6,000 annually in child support.  Her average 
monthly income (less paycheck deductions) from all sources is about $2,600 and her monthly expenses equal $1,642 on average.  She pays five 
creditors about $544 a month on average; none of these five creditors is listed in the SOR.  She is current on all her recurring financial obligations, 
<EM>e.g.</EM>, credit card accounts.  SOR answer and FORM response.  On August 28, 2001, she paid off two past due debts (SOR &para;1.b and SOR &para;1.e) 
by paying a total of $233.48 to the creditors.  FORM response.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant owes one telephone company $565 and another telephone company $1,184 because the telephone was placed in her 
name--although a significant portion of the phone charges was incurred by her roommates.  She did in the beginning make payments on the bills 
until she felt it became too much for her to bear.  The last payments on these bills occurred in March 1997.  She is now unwilling to pay off the 
$1,749 outstanding balance unless ordered by a court to do so.  FORM items 4, 5, and 8; SOR answer.</P> 
 
<P>In May 1996 the Applicant co-signed a note to finance the purchase by her future husband of a 1992 automobile.  The car was wrecked in 
September 1996, was voluntarily repossessed, and then was repaired and resold at auction.  The balance due on the note after the resale receipts 
were credited is more than $11,000.  No payments have been received since November 1996.  She believes that her husband is responsible for 
the payment.  She is unwilling to make payment on this past due debt unless ordered by the courts.  FORM items 4, 5, and 8; SOR answer.</P> 
 
<P>In June 1998 the Applicant signed a security clearance application (SF-86) in which she denied having been over 180 days delinquent on any 
debts since June 1991 and denied being currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts.  FORM item 4.  She was interviewed by a Defense 
Security Service (DSS) agent in late 1998 and discussed her debts with him in a statement not in the record.  <EM>See </EM>FORM item 4 at page 1 and 
FORM item 8 at page 13.  In the spring of 1999 another SF-86 was electronically transmitted to the DSS Operations Center/Columbus by her 
facility security officer.<A HREF="01-07589.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The Applicant did not sign the second SF-86.  FORM item 8.</P>

</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an 
individual's security eligibility.  The guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or revoke a clearance 
(Disqualifying Conditions or DC) and those that may be considered in determining whether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified 
information (Mitigating Conditions or MC).  In evaluating this case, relevant adjudicative guidelines as set forth below have been carefully 
considered as the most pertinent to the facts of this particular case.</P> 
 
<P>The guidelines, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating conditions most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case are:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>GUIDELINE F - FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>[1st] A history of not meeting financial obligations; </P> 
 
<P>[3rd] Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>[3rd] The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation);</P> 
 
<P>[6th] The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>GUIDELINE E - PERSONAL CONDUCT</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>    [2nd] The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal 
history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security 
clearance eligibility or trustworth-iness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>None applicable.</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 to the Directive provides that the adjudicator should consider the following factors:</P> 
 
<P>The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledge-able participation</P> 
 
<P>The frequency and recency of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>The voluntariness of participation</P> 
 
<P>The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes</P> 
 
<P>The motivation for the conduct</P> 
 
<P>The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</P> 
 
<P>The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</P> 
 
<P>The Directive also requires the undersigned to consider, as appropriate, the factors enumerated in Section 6.3:</P> 
 
<P>a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</P> 
 
<P>b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P> 
 
<P>c. Age of the applicant.</P> 
 
<P>d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the 
consequences involved.</P> 
 
<P>e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>f. Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</P> 
 
<P>Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance 
may be made only upon an affirmative finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly consistent</SPAN> with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall 
common sense determination required, the Administrative Judge may draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and 
logical basis in the evidence of record.  Determinations under the Directive include consideration of the risk that an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information as that term is defined and established under Executive Order 12958, effective on 
October 14, 1995.</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme Court has 
said:</P> 
 
<P>"It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence standard 
without departing from the 'clearly consistent with the interests of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government to support the denial [of a 
security clearance] by a preponderance of the evidence would inevitably shift the emphasis and involve the Board in second-guessing the agency's 
national security determinations."</P> 
 
<P> <EM>Dept. of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that Supreme Court guidance in its context to go 
to the minimum <STRONG><EM>quantum</EM></STRONG> of the admissible evidence that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its case, that is, 
substantial evidence but something less than a preponderance of the evidence--rather than as an indication of the Court's tolerance for error 
below.<A HREF="01-07589.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his or her security eligibility through 
evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case or through evidence of affirmative defenses.  Assuming the Government's 
case is not refuted, and further assuming it can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an applicant might deliberately or inadvertently fail 
to safeguard properly classified information, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he or she is nonetheless eligible to hold 
a security clearance.<A HREF="01-07589.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, the undersigned concludes that the Government 
established its case with regard to Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has a lengthy history of not meeting her financial obligations, at times due to her inability--and at present due to her 
unwillingness--to do so.  This falls within the scope of DC  #1 and DC #3 under Guideline F, which are identified on page 4 <EM>supra</EM>.  She has 
recently paid off two small debts; SOR &para;1.b and SOR &para;1.e are therefore found in her favor.  However, she has a net  monthly remainder of over 
$400 on average over and above her expenses and recurring financial obligations.  Her outstanding past due debts date from November 1996 
(automobile loan deficiency) and March 1997 (telephone charges).  These debts became delinquent initially due to unemployment or 
underemployment combined with complications arising from the 1997 separation from her husband.  <EM>See </EM>MC #3 identified on page 4 <EM>supra</EM>.  
These conditions do not justify her lack of good-faith effort now to repay or otherwise resolve them. There is no evidence in the record that she 
has sought a repayment plan or compromise from these creditors within the last four years. <EM>See </EM>MC #6 identified on page 4 <EM>supra</EM>.  Therefore, 
SOR &para;1 (financial considerations) is concluded adversely to the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, the undersigned concludes that the Government 
established its case with regard to Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant knew when she signed her security clearance application (SF-86) in June 1998 that she had been over 180 days delinquent on 
some debts since June 1991 and was currently over 90 days delinquent on them.  Nevertheless, she falsified her SF-86 by answering "no" to the 
respective questions on the SF-86.  This falls within the scope of DC #2, which is also identified on page 4 <EM>supra</EM>.<A HREF="01-07589.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  No acceptable justification, 
explanation, mitigation, or extenuation has been presented by the Applicant.  Therefore, SOR &para;2 (personal conduct) is concluded adversely to the 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each clearance decision is required to take into consideration pertinent factors set forth in Section 6.3 of the Directive and in the adjudicative 
process discussion at enclosure 2 to the Directive.  These factors are identified on pages 4-5 <EM>supra</EM>.  The Applicant's refusal to deal with 
significant long past due debts properly attributable to her is more serious than the falsification of her SF-86 form over three years ago.  While her 
youth and family responsibilities can be considered extenuating considerations under Guideline F, there is a distinct probability that she will persist 
in the future to ignore her obligations under the automobile loan and the charges incurred on the telephone placed in her name.</SPAN></P>
