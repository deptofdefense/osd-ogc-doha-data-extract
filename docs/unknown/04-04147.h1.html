<P>Applicant is married to a citizen of Russia who resides with him in the U.S.  His mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Russia.  The security concern based

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On April 7, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to 
deny Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  The SOR alleges security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).   It alleges Applicant's spouse is a 
Russian citizen residing in the U.S. (&para;1.a); his mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of Russia (&para; 1.b); and he traveled to Russia in March 
1999, June 1999, and July 2000 (&para; 1.c).  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on April 20, 2005, admitted the factual allegations in &para; 1.a, part of &para; 1.b, and &para; 
1.c.  He elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to an administrative judge on May 18, 2006, and reassigned to me on 
July 20, 2006, based on workload. The case was heard on August 22, 2006, as scheduled.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 31, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 45-year-old nuclear physicist for a U.S. government contractor.  His area of specific expertise is detection of nuclear materials in cargo entering 
the U.S. (Applicant's Exhibit (AX) A at 2).  He is not involved in the development of weapons (Tr. 36), and all his current work is unclassified (Tr. 62). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant received his Ph.D. degree in physics from a U.S. university in December 1990.  He has worked for his current employer since August 2003.  His 
current employer strongly supports his application for a clearance (AX A at 2).  He has received numerous commendations (AX A at 7-10<A HREF="04-04147.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>).  He was 
previously granted security clearances in 1982 and 1990.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Germany in March 1961.  His mother is a native of Germany, and his father is a native-born U.S. citizen who married Applicant's 
mother while serving in the U.S. Forces in Germany.  Applicant and his family came to the U.S. in 1965 (Tr. 31).  His mother became a naturalized U.S. citizen 
in November 1975 (Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at 11).  He served in the U.S. Navy from January 1982 to August 1984 and received an Honorable Discharge 
(AX A at 3). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In July 1999, Applicant married a Russian citizen.  The record contains little information about his spouse's personal history before their marriage.  The record 
does not reflect how he met his spouse, who resided in Russia until their marriage.  His spouse has been a permanent U.S. resident since January 10, 2000, and 
she has applied for U.S. citizenship (AX A at 17, 18; Tr. 32).  She is employed as a draftsman by a U.S. company that manufactures microwave wave guides for 
ships (AX A at 25; Tr. 40).  She is regarded as a pleasant and dependable employee (AX A at 25).  They have a son, born in January 2001 (AX A at 5).  
Applicant adopted his spouse's daughter in October 2000 (AX A at 6; Tr. 29).  His adoptive daughter's natural father is a Russian businessman currently 
residing in Ukraine, but his contact with her is limited to annual birthday greetings (Tr. 59).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's 62-year-old mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Russia.  She worked as a mechanical engineer in a truck manufacturing plant in Russia until 
she retired about 10 years ago (Tr. 33, 49).  She receives a pension, but the record does not reflect whether it is from the Russian government.  Other than this 
possible pension, she has no connections with the Russian government (Tr. 33-34).  The only other family member related to Applicant's spouse is her uncle 
(her mother's brother), who is a retired engineer (Tr. 34).  Applicant's mother-in-law was divorced long before he met his spouse.  Neither Applicant nor his 
spouse has any contact with her father (Answer to SOR).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's spouse has visited her mother in Russia three times since June 1999, and her mother has visited Applicant and his spouse in the U.S. twice (Tr. 44-45).  His spouse talks with her mother on the phone about once a week and occasionally talks to friends in Russia (Tr. 43).  Applicant has virtually no 
conversation with his mother-in-law because of the language barrier (Tr. 47).  Applicant's adopted daughter and natural son are able to speak some Russian and 
are close to his mother-in-law (Tr. 65).  Applicant and his spouse hope to bring his mother-in-law to the U.S. so that she can be closer to her daughter and 
grandchildren.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant traveled to Russia three times.  In March 1999, he went to Russia to visit his future spouse and to present a seminar at a Russian university.  He 
proposed marriage to his future spouse during this trip.  He worked for a government contractor at the time and also used the visit to facilitate an exchange 
program between his employer and their Russian counterparts.  In June 1999, he escorted his fianc&eacute; and her daughter to the U.S.  In July 2000, he helped his 
wife dispose of her Russian apartment.  He has not visited Russia since July 2000 (Tr. 42-43).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant does not believe he is vulnerable to direct or indirect exploitation or coercion, because his in-laws in Russia are retired and he does not work on 
weaponry.  If anyone attempted to use his family ties to obtain information, he would report it to the appropriate authorities (Tr. 50).  He is aware that Russia is 
"a bit chaotic," but he and his spouse have never encountered any problems while visiting Russia (Tr. 56).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At Department Counsel's request and without objection from Applicant, I have taken administrative notice of adjudicative facts pertaining to Russia, based on 
official U.S. government documents.  The Russian Federation emerged after the December 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, inheriting the permanent seat 
on the United Nations Security Council and the bulk of its foreign assets and debt. The 1993 constitution established a strong executive branch and a 
considerably weaker legislative branch.  In spite of efforts to foster judicial independence, many judges still see their role as protectors of state interests.  The 
precise distribution of powers between the central government and regional and local authorities is still evolving.  Russia's human rights record is uneven, 
especially in the treatment of prison inmates and detainees.  </SPAN>U.S. Dept. of State, <EM>Background Note: Russia</EM> at 4-6 (Aug. 2005), attached to the record as Hearing 
Exhibit (HX) I.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although the Russian constitution guarantees its citizens the right to choose where they live and to travel abroad, some city governments have restricted this 
right through residential registration rules.  U.S. citizens who previously held Russian citizenship often must formally renounce their Russian citizenship before 
applying for a Russian visa, lest they be considered Russian citizens and not permitted to leave without a Russian passport.  </SPAN>U.S. Dept. of State, <EM>Consular 
Information Sheet, Russia Federation </EM>at 4 (Jun. 7, 2005), attached to the record as HX II.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because of continued civil and political unrest, the U.S. Department of State strongly discourages U.S. citizens from traveling in or near Chechnya.  There is a 
heightened potential for terrorism, including bombings and hostage taking, throughout Russia.  </SPAN>U.S. Dept. of State, <EM>Public Announcement, Russia Federation 
</EM>(Mar. 30, 2005), attached to the record as HX III.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Violent crime</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is a problem, especially in large cities.  Extortion and corruption are common in the business 
community.  It is not uncommon for foreigners to be harassed or mistreated by law enforcement and other officials.  </SPAN>HX II at 6-7.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The U.S. and Russia share common interests on a broad range of issues, including strategic arsenal reduction, the war on terrorism, controlling the proliferation 
of nuclear weapons, and resolving international conflicts. U.S. strategy is to assist Russia's transition to a democratic, free-market society and to promote 
establishment of lasting ties at all levels of society. </SPAN><EM>Id.</EM> at 12<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Notwithstanding its cooperation with the U.S. on controlling nuclear proliferation, Russia sells 
technology for weapons of mass destruction and missiles to other countries to generate revenue and gain diplomatic influence.  The Russian government and 
non-government entities within Russian support missile programs and civil nuclear projects in China, Iran, India, and Syria.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>Vice Admiral Lowell E. Jacoby,

and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The concern under this guideline is that a security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress.  "These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that 
could result in the compromise of classified information."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may arise when "[a]n immediate family 
member [spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters], or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or 
resident or present in, a foreign country."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A disqualifying condition (DC 2) also may arise when an applicant is "[s]haring living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if 
the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.2.  Where the cohabitant is also an immediate family member under DC 1, 
both disqualifying conditions may apply.  Both conditions are raised in this case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Family ties with persons in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, automatically disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, such ties raise a prima facie 
security concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of 
persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></SPAN></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Directive&para; E3.1.15; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case 
No. 99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The totality of an applicant's family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family 
tie must be considered.  </SPAN>ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003).  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse."  ISCR Case 
No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant has rebutted the presumed ties of affection for his mother-in-law, but not the 
presumed ties of obligation.  Based on evidence that Applicant has never had any contact with his spouse's father, and his mother-in-law was divorced long 
before Applicant met his future spouse, he has rebutted the allegation that he has a Russian father-in-law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Since the government produced substantial evidence to establish DC 1 and DC 2, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never 
shifted to the government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In cases where an applicant has immediate family members who are citizens or residents of a foreign country or who are connected with a foreign government, 
a mitigating condition (MC 1) may apply if "the immediate family members, cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a 
position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States."  
Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of MC 1("agents of a foreign power <STRONG>or</STRONG> in a position to be exploited"), it requires proof "that an applicant's 
family members, cohabitant, or associates in question are (a) not agents of a foreign power, <STRONG>and</STRONG> (b) not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way 
that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  "The United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified 
information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has 
interests inimical to those of the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  The distinctions between friendly and unfriendly 
governments must be made with caution.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national 
security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.</SPAN>  <EM>See</EM> 
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation's government, its relationship with 
the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant's family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The 
risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or 
dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Neither Applicant's spouse nor his mother-in-law is an agent of a foreign power.  His spouse resides with him in the U.S., and thus is somewhat insulated from 
the direct influence of the lawless, corrupt, and dissident elements of Russia. However, his spouse is vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress exercised 
indirectly through her mother.  Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that his spouse and mother-in-law could not be exploited in ways that could 
force him to choose between loyalty to his spouse and her mother and the security interests of the U.S.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After evaluating each family member's individual 
circumstances as well as the totality of Applicant's family ties to Russia, I conclude MC 1 is not established</SPAN>.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A mitigating condition (MC 3) may apply if "[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.3.  
Applicant has virtually no significant communication with his mother-in-law.  Thus, MC 3 is established for him and his mother-in-law. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Foreign travel is not an enumerated disqualifying condition under this guideline.  Applicant made three trips to Russia, all of which occurred in connection with 
his marriage.  The first trip also was connected with his employment by a government contractor.  I conclude his foreign travel has no independent security 
significance, and I resolve SOR &para; 1.c in his favor. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Whole Person Analysis</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>In addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline, I have also considered the general adjudicative guidelines 
in the Directive &para; E2.2.1.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">I have considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through E2.2.1.9.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is little evidence in the record regarding the personal history of Applicant's spouse before Applicant met her.  There is no evidence of the circumstances 
in which they met and became sufficiently acquainted to decide to marry. The evidence concerning the personal history of Applicant's mother-in-law is sparse.  
Applicant's spouse clearly has strong ties of affection for her mother, and Applicant's children and his mother-in-law share strong ties of affection.  These 
strong family ties make Applicant vulnerable to indirect coercion, exploitation, or duress exercised through his spouse and her mother.  On the other hand, 
Applicant is a mature, well-educated adult who has devoted most of his adult life to using his education and skills to enhance the security of the U.S.  He grew 
up in a military family and served honorably in the U.S. Navy.  He has held a security clearance for many years.  He was direct, sincere, and credible during the 
hearing.  Nevertheless, he has not allayed the security concerns raised by his family ties.   Close cases must be resolved in favor of denying a clearance.</SPAN></P>
