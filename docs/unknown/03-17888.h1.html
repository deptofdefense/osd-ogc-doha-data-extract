<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's criminal conduct, deliberate falsification of his 2 January 2002 security clearance application, and his financial irresponsibility disqualify him for a

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 13 February 2004 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation 
of his clearance because of criminal conduct, personal conduct, and financial considerations.<A HREF="03-17888.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant answered the SOR on 8 March 2004 and requested a 
hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 10 September 2004 and I convened a hearing on 10 January 2005. DOHA received the transcript 18 January 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the Guideline J allegations, except for 1.h., the Guideline E allegations, except for 2.f., and the Guideline F allegations; accordingly, I 
incorporate his admissions as findings of fact. He is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a 55-year-old facility support associate employed by a defense contractor since December 2001. He has not 
previously had a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant applied for an industrial clearance in January 2002, he answered "no" to a series of questions requiring him to disclose his criminal record 
(questions 21-26), any drug or alcohol abuse (questions 27-29), and any adverse financial history (questions 33-39). In fact, he had a substantial criminal 
history, some of which was required to be reported, an extensive drug abuse history, all of which was required to be reported, and was currently experiencing 
financial difficulties.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's criminal involvement covers a period of nearly 20 years, 1978-1997. He was arrested for DWI in 1978.<A HREF="03-17888.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He was arrested for disorderly conduct in 
April 1982 and November 1989. Both charges were ultimately dropped. He was arrested in July 1990 for possessing stolen mail (GE 3). The charge was later 
dismissed. He was arrested in August 1990 for possessing stolen mail, trespass, and forgery.<A HREF="03-17888.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> On the advice of counsel, he later pled to the forgery charge and 
received three years probation (GE 3).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In August 1994, Applicant was charged with larceny of a $35.00 watch from a department store. The charge was nolle prossed (GE 2, 3). In December 1996, 
Applicant was arrested for shoplifting. The charge was later dismissed. In October 1997, Applicant was arrested for theft under $300.00 and later had a bench 
warrant issued when he failed to appear for his court date (GE 6).<A HREF="03-17888.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In addition to concealing his 1978 DWI arrest, Applicant concealed a 1993 arrest for possession of cocaine (GE 5).<A HREF="03-17888.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> He also concealed his extensive history of 
cocaine abuse from 1992-1997.<A HREF="03-17888.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Furthermore, when Applicant completed his clearance application, he had an outstanding $2,500.00 judgment from 1998,<A HREF="03-17888.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> and 
three delinquent accounts totaling over $1,500.00.<A HREF="03-17888.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admitted concealing his criminal arrest record because he thought revealing it would keep him from getting his clearance and cost him his job (GE 5). 
However, he denied deliberately omitting his drug and alcohol abuse history and his financial difficulties. He thinks he misread the drug questions and 
overlooked the financial questions entirely.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to a lengthy period of unemployment he experience between January 1996 and March 1998. However, he has not 
taken any steps to address his past due accounts despite continued employment in his current job since December 2001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's character ref</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">erences (AE A) consider him an honest individual and a trustworthy employee. Neither appears to be aware of the allegations of the 
SOR.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classif</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ied information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct),</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-17888.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government established a Guideline J case under disqualifying conditions 1 and 2,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-17888.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant did not mitigate the conduct. His spate of drug and 
alcohol offenses, disorderly conduct offenses, and petty larceny and shoplifting offenses cast serious question on his judgment and reliability notwithstanding 
the last of these offenses occurred in 1997. In 2002, he deliberately concealed his criminal record, drug use, and financial problems from the government in 
violation of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">18 U.S.C. &sect;1001.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I resolve Guideline J against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established a Guideline E case under disqualifying condition 2,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="03-17888.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided 
false answers to six different questions on his clearance application. His conduct demonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared personnel and suggests he is 
willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government interests. The government has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse 
information about an applicant before making a clearance decision, and relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information. Further, an 
applicant's willingness to report adverse information about himself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security violations or other 
security concerns in the future, something the government relies on in order to perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of classified information. 
I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established a Guideline F case under disqualifying conditions 1 and 3,<A HREF="03-17888.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Although his 
two-years' unemployment from 1996-1998 was beyond his control,<A HREF="03-17888.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> he has taken no steps to address the past due debts after regaining full time employment.
