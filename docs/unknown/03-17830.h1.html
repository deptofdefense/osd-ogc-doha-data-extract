<P>Applicant, a dual citizen of the United States and Lebanon, has acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for a country other than the United States. This 
has included Applicant using his Lebanese passport <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">to enter and exit </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Lebanon</SPAN>, identifying himself to the Lebanese Government as Lebanese citizen, and 
working for a Lebanese Government owned company, all after he became a United Sates citizen.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's immediate family members, including his aunts 
and uncles, with whom he has close and continuing contact, are citizens and residents of Lebanon, and he continues to own a home in Lebanon. The evidence 
establishes that Applicant is vulnerable to foreign influence. </SPAN>Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated  March 11, 
2004, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct 
proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. The SOR was based on Foreign Preference (Guideline C) 
related to his exercise of dual citizenship with the United States and Lebanon, and on Foreign Influence (Guideline B) concerns because of the foreign residency 
and citizenship of close family members and financial interest in Lebanon.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant<EM></EM> filed a notarized response dated March 22, 2004, to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative 
Judge.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 20, 2004, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the 
parties on June 7, 2004, and the hearing was held on July 2, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 through 7) and no witnesses were called. Applicant, through his personal 
representative, offered two documentary exhibits, (Exhibits A and B), and offered his own testimony and that of one other witness. The transcript (TR) was 
received on July 29, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains  two allegations, 1.a. and </SPAN>1.b.,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under Guideline C and five allegations, 2.a. through 2.e., under Guideline B. Applicant admitted all of the 
SOR allegations. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon 
due consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 40 year old employee of a </SPAN> United States <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">defense contractor  </SPAN>that wants him to have a security clearance.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He is married and has five children.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He 
received a masters degree in electrical engineering from a United States university.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference). The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in 
such a way as to indicate a preference for another country over the United States.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was born in the Lebanon in 1964 and immigrated to the United States in 1975.  He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1987. In October 
1995 he moved back to Lebanon with his family, and he remained there through October 1998. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> retained and renewed his Lebanese passport after he became a United States citizen, the last time in 2001. When he traveled to Lebanon in 1995, he 
used his Lebanese passport and identified himself as a Lebanese citizen.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He ultimately used his </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Lebanese passport </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">to enter and exit </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Lebanon</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> on three occasions 
after he became a United States citizen, the most  recent in 2002. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's current Lebanese passport was issued from Beirut in 1996.  Applicant finally 
</SPAN>relinquished this Lebanese  passport to the proper Lebanese authorities <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">on May 28, 2004. </SPAN>However, he did not renounced his Lebanese citizenship, although he 
had the opportunity to do it on that date. While he has indicated that he would be willing to renounce his Lebanese citizenship in the future, he had no 
legitimate explanation for his failure to renounce it when he had the opportunity (TR at 84-86) <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> (Exhibit B)</SPAN>. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence). The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has immediate 
family members or people to whom he may be bound by affection or obligation who are citizens of Lebanon, and that he has other significant ties to Lebanon.  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has aunts and uncles who are citizens </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and residents of</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Lebanon. He generally speaks to them once a month by telephone or E-mail. Applicant still 
owns a home in Lebanon. He has indicated a plan to travel to Lebanon, once every three years, to visit his family and to "check on my house" (Response to 
SOR).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>During part of the three year period that he resided in Lebanon as a Lebanese citizen, 1996-1997,  he worked for a company, which was owned and run by the 
Lebanese Government. Applicant testified that he might consider moving back to Lebanon if it became safe to live there again. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination required. 
Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other 
pertinent behavioral changes; the potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in 
the future. <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2. </P> 
 
<P>Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or 
that the factors apply equally in every case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable 
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or 
emotionally unstable behavior. See Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.4. </P> 
 
<P>Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon 
an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination 
required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In 
addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Decisions under the Directive include 
consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets its burden and 
establishes conduct cognizable as a security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, 
extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." Any doubt as to whether access 
to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security. <EM>See</EM> Enclosure 2 to the Directive, Section 
E2.2.2.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I 
conclude the following with respect to guidelines C and B:</P> 
 
<P>Guideline C is based on actions taken by an individual that indicates a preference for a foreign country over the United States. Applicant's continued use of his 
Lebanese passport after he became a United States citizen raises serious Foreign Preference (Guideline C) concerns. Applicant's</P> 
 
<P>questionable willingness to renounce his Lebanese citizenship must also be considered adversely to Applicant. </P> 
 
<P>Disqualifying Conditions (DC) E2.A3.1.2.1. applies because of Applicant's use of his Lebanese passport on many occasions, his identifying himself several 
times upon entering and exiting Lebanon as a Lebanese citizen, and  and his working for a Lebanese Government owned company, all after he became a United 
States citizen, are continuing examples of Applicant's exercising dual citizenship.  DC E2.A3.1.2.2. also applies because of Applicant's continued use and his 
failure to return his Lebanese passport to the proper authorities, until May 28, 2004. No mitigating condition (MC) applies in this case under Guideline C.</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, 
influence or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. </P> 
 
<P>DC E2.A2.1.2.1. must be considered adversely when an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, 
is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country, must be considered in assessing Applicant's current suitability for access to classified information. 
The existence of <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">immediate </SPAN>Applicant's uncles and aunts, who are citizens of and reside in Lebanon comes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1.  
Additionally, his home ownership in Lebanon would be a substantial financial interest so that  DC E2.A2.1.2.8. also applies in this case.  No MC applies under 
Guideline B.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Formal Findings as required by Section 3. Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 to the Directive are hereby rendered as follows:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1. Guideline C:  AGAINST APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1. a.:  Against Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.b.:  Against Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 2. Guideline B:  AGAINST APPLICANT</P>

<P>Subparagraph 2.e.:  Against Applicant</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for Applicant. </P>
