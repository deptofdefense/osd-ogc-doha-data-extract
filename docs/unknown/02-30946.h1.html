<P>Applicant had substantial financial problems paying his debts when he was an employee of the federal government.  He left government service and became a 
computer technician for a defense contractor.  It is a temporary position and Applicant has been laid off for nine of the approximately 22 months he has been 
employed there.  Applicant failed to sufficiently mitigate the financial security concerns alleged in the statement of reasons.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 30 April 2003, under the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="02-30946.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-30946.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns 
raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 7 August 2003 and elected to have a hearing 
before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to another administrative judge on 6 November 2003, but was transferred to me on 26 November 2003.  
On 17 December 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 29 December 2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 41 years old, married, and paying child support on one child.  He served four years in the military during the early 1980s.  He worked for a 
government agency from 1986 until 2002.  He now works as a computer technician for a defense contractor.  He is a temporary employee and has been laid off 
when there is no work-five times in less than two years for periods totaling approximately nine months.  Ex. B.  He was unemployed from June - November 
2003.</P> 
 
<P>In his security clearance application (SCA) signed on 15 April 2002, Applicant denied that, in the previous seven years, he had any property repossessed or 
debts delinquent for more than 180 days.  He also denied having any current debts delinquent more than 90 days.  The chart below summarizes the status of the 
financial issues alleged in the SOR:</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2000, but it was dismissed because he failed to pay (&para; 1.a.); had his house 
foreclosed on (&para; 1.b.); and has several delinquent debts totaling approximately $15,000 (&para;&para; 1.c.-1.h.).  An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of 
having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.l.l. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations (DC 
E2.A7.1.2.1.) and has been unable or unwilling to satisfy his debts (DC E2.A7.1.2.3.).  Although he claims to have made a few payments totaling $200, he 
produced no evidence to support these claims.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant claims his financial problems are due in large part to his periods of unemployment-conditions beyond his control.  MC E2.A6.1.3.3.  However, most 
of his financial difficulties arose before he switched to the temporary job with the defense contractor.  He commenced his Chapter 13 bankruptcy on 24 
February 2000 and it was dismissed at Applicant's request on 9 August 2000 because it was not in his "best interests at the time."  Tr. 15. His auto loan was 60 
days past due within two months of his switch from government employee to contractor employee.  Ex. 3 at 6.  Applicant failed to establish that his poor 
financial condition was as a result of his layoffs at the new job.  Although he was out of work for one period of approximately five months in 2003, he 
presented no evidence that he tried to ameliorate his condition by taking another job.  Applicant failed to sufficiently mitigate the security concerns alleged in 
the SOR.</SPAN></P>
