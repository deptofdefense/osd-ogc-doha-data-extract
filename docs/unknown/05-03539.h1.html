<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On July 29, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="05-03539.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline E ( personal conduct). Applicant submitted a sworn answer to the SOR, 
dated August 22, 2005, admitted the Guideline F allegations, denied the Guideline E allegations,<A HREF="05-03539.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and requested a hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">This case was assigned to me on January 19, 2006. A notice of hearing was issued on February 13, 2006, scheduling the hearing for February 28, 2006.<A HREF="05-03539.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted six documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6, and admitted 
into the record without objection. Applicant testified and submitted eight documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-8, and 
admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on March 8, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the 
following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 46 years old and has been employed as a mechanic by a defense contractor since March 2004. He was steadily employed by a different company 
from 1987 until June 2000, when he was laid off. He remained unemployed until about October 2002, but did attend school and earn a certificate as an airframe 
and power plant mechanic during those years. From about October 2002, until he was hired by his present employer, Applicant worked sporadically on contract 
assignments at various locations around the country. He has never held a security clearance.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant escaped from South Viet Nam with two of his brothers when that country fell to Communist North Viet Nam in 1975. He eventually made his way to 
the United States and became a U.S. citizen in September 1986. The remainder of his immediate family has since immigrated to the United States. Applicant 
married a Vietnamese immigrant in July 1989, and that marriage ended in divorce in June 1999. He has a nine-year-old son from the marriage. While Applicant 
is able to read, write, and understand English, it is obvious from his testimony that English is his second language.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">SOR subparagraph 1.a lists a collection account owing in the amount of $12,506.00. The information contained in GE 4-6 disclose this account was opened in 
August 1998, listed as having been charged off at least as of June 2003, and was paid off in September 2005. The account had a $0 balance as of January 2006. 
Applicant explained the account became delinquent during the time he was unemployed and/or underemployed. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">SOR subparagraph 1.b lists a collection account owing in the amount of $15,177.00. GE 4-6 disclose this account was listed as having been submitted for 
collection at least as of June 2003, and was transferred to the creditor listed in the SOR at least as of June 2005. The earliest listed date for any activity related 
to this account is the date of last activity being December 2000. Applicant has consistently and credibly asserted this account was opened by his ex-wife 
misusing his name and social security number without his knowledge after their divorce. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant failed to list the delinquent accounts listed in the SOR in a security clearance application (SF 86) he submitted in May 2003. He credibly explained he 
was unaware of the existence of the account listed in subparagraph 1.b when he submitted the SF 86. Regarding the account listed in subparagraph 1.a, 
Applicant indicated in his response to the SOR and in a statement he provided in February 2005 (GE 2) that he had not reviewed a credit report before 
submitting the SF 86 and was unaware of the delinquency. He testified he attempted to make some payments on this account while unemployed/underemployed 
but got behind sometime between 2002 and 2003 (Tr. p. 36). In attempting to explain why he did not list the account in the SF 86, Applicant testified as 
follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">JUDGE LAZZARO:  The debt that you paid off, how was it that you didn't know it was delinquent when you filed your security clearance application?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">THE WITNESS: I do not completely understanding when I fill out - -</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">JUDGE LAZZARO: Say that over again.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">THE WITNESS: I am not clearly understanding when I fill out the Form 86 at the time I fill out the Form 86, and I do not have my report, credit report at the 
time I fill out the form.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">JUDGE LAZZARO: What didn't you understand about the question?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">THE WITNESS: I do not understand the delinquent 180, and 90 because I never got that kind of question in my mind all my life?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">JUDGE LAZZARO: What did you think it was asking about?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">THE WITNESS: I think it ask me about am I short on my money at this time, or I got understanding what I owe. (Tr. pp. 43-44)</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F, 
pertaining to financial considerations and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="05-03539.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="05-03539.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="05-03539.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="05-03539.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="05-03539.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="05-03539.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-03539.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="05-03539.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="05-03539.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="05-03539.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal acts to generate funds. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has consistently and credibly explained that the account listed in subparagraph 1.b was opened by his ex-wife after their divorce without his 
knowledge. However, he was responsible for allowing the account listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a to become delinquent and ultimately submitted for collection 
while he was unemployed and/or underemployed. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>; and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debt</EM> apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has satisfied the sole delinquent account properly chargeable to him. Mitigating Conditions (MC) 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment  . . . )</EM>; and MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts</EM> apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's explanations for not disclosing the delinquent account properly chargeable to him in the SF 86 he submitted are credible. In making that 
determination, I have carefully considered his appearance and demeanor while testifying, the substance of his testimony and statements, the fact that English is 
clearly his second language, and his obvious lack of sophistication in such matters. Applicant did not deliberately provide false information or fail to disclose 
accurate information when he submitted the SF 86. No disqualifying condition applies under Guideline E. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, including the testimony and evidence provided by Applicant, the whole 
person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns in this case. He has overcome the case against him and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. Guideline F and Guideline E 
are decided for Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
