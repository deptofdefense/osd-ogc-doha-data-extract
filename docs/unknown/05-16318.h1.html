<P>Applicant is vice president of contracts for a federal contractor.  He abused illegal drugs over a ten-year period, mostly in high school and college.  He quit using illegal substances in August 2004, 
contemporaneous with receiving a substantial promotion from his employer with added responsibilities.  He stated an intention to not use drugs in the future.  He demonstrated more mature 
judgments as his responsibilities increased.  Drug usage was not recent and he successfully mitigated the drug involvement security concerns.  Clearance is granted.</P>

</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 &para;&nbsp;E3.1.2 (Jan. 2, 
1960), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 24, 2006 detailing the basis for its decision - security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of the 
Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on February 14, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on July 11, 2006.  Notice of 
hearing was issued August 25, 2006.  I convened a hearing on September 19, 2006, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.  The government offered one exhibit, Applicant offered six exhibits, and all exhibits were admitted without objection.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 29, 
2006.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted all allegations in the SOR.<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> He listed the incidents set forth in the SOR in his security clearance application.<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He admitted this conduct during his testimony.<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  These 
admissions are incorporated herein.  In addition, after thorough and careful review of the evidence, I make the following findings of fact. </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a married, 27-year-old vice president of contracts for a federal contractor.  He has a double major in business, and finance and international business.<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency between 1994 and August 2004.<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>   He purchased marijuana.<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  He abused the prescription drug Ritalin<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> that had not been prescribed for him from 
October 1995 to December 2001, and the prescription drug Percocet<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> until 2000.  He twice tried cocaine between 1999 and December 2001, and used hashish in 2000.<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Between March and May 
1999, he twice used MDMA (Ecstasy).<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>   Between 1995 and 2000, he used psilocybin (mushrooms) and/or LSD at least five times.<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>The majority of Applicant's drug use occurred between 1994 and December 2001, when he was in high school and college.  He used drugs in social settings, with friends at parties, just "hanging 
out."<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  After graduation, he only used marijuana.  He has taken no alcohol education classes or treatment programs.<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  He never went to school or work while under the influence of drugs.<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN>  
Applicant used drugs because of "youth, curiosity, being social," and for experimental purposes.<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  He has not used any illegal substances since August 2004.<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN>  His promotion to his current 
position was the "driving force" behind his decision to quit abusing drugs.<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN>  "I was promoted.  I now have people that report directly to me in my job.  I've gotten a substantial salary increase.  I 
bought a car.  I bought a house.  My wife is pregnant.  These are the big changes in my life."<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN>  He stated his intent  not to use illegal drugs in the future.<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>Two of Applicant's co-workers (one was his supervisor)  testified that Applicant was "mature for his age and experience,"<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> had "impressive knowledge level for his job,"<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> had "tremendous work 
ethic,"<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> and "is reliable, trustworthy, and will maintain classified information."<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>"No one has a 'right' to a security clearance."<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN>  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether 
an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."<EM><A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN>  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicants eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  Each security clearance decision "must be a fair and 
impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy."<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  An applicant "has the ultimate 
burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating the security 
worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding 
circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with 
knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or presence of rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  The decision to deny an 
individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.<EM><A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the 
Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline H--Drug Involvement</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The government established its case under Guideline H.  Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1. (<EM>Any drug abuse</EM>)<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> and DI DC E2.A8.1.2.2. (<EM>Illegal drug possession, 
including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution</EM>)<EM> </EM>are applicable, because Applicant admitted drug use, possession, and purchase. </P> 
 
<P>Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC)  E2.A8.1.3.1. (<EM>The drug involvement was not recent</EM>) applies.  Applicant has been drug free for over two years.  The Directive does not define 
"recent." In ISCR Case No. 04-12648 at 9 (App. Bd.  Oct. 20,  2006), the Appeal Board   </P> 
 
<P>declined to set any "bright-line" rule as to what constitutes "recent" under the Directive regarding illegal drug use. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-10454 (November 23, 2004) at p. 4. The Board has 
indicated the matter requires an Administrative Judge to evaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion as to the recency of an applicant's conduct. See, e.g., ISCR Case 
No. 02-22173 (May 26, 2004) at p. 4. The application of a mitigating condition like Guideline H Mitigating Condition 1 can depend upon a number of factors in addition to the simple passage of 
time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0611 (November 1, 1999) at p. 2. The interval of time presented in this case, slightly less than two and a half years, must be evaluated in light of other factors in 
the case.<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>"Consider a person drug-free for at least two years<STRONG>,</STRONG> marijuana was used regularly, or any other drug was used occasionally, and there are no aggravating circumstances.  There was no evidence of 
psychological or physical dependence at the time subject was using drugs, and subject has demonstrated a stable life style with satisfactory employment record since then."<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Applicant fits this 
profile.  Applicant's use of marijuana fell between occasional and frequent use.  All other drugs were experimental use.  I conclude guideline H for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Whole Person Analysis</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance."<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></SPAN>  "Available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination."<EM><A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A></SPAN>  In evaluating Applicant's case, I have considered the adjudicative 
process factors listed in the directive.<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A></SPAN>  </P> 
 
<P><EM>  </EM>In addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I  considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.<A HREF="05-16318.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A></SPAN>  I 
considered his age (26), his education which includes two majors, his employment, and what might motivate him to stop his drug abuse.  Candor with the government about a person's negatives is 
the crux of a trustworthiness determination.  If a person discloses the adverse information about himself, he may be trusted with confidential or classified information.  Applicant was completely 
truthful about his drug use, disclosing it on his security clearance application, admitting his usage in his answer to the SOR, and in his testimony.  Even though his drug use extended over a ten-year 
period, most of this time he was in high school or college.</P> 
 
<P>The illegal use of drugs raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Moreover, impaired ability while under the influence of illegal drugs 
increases the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified material.  Here, Applicant's motivation to use drugs was peer pressure and a desire to be sociable. In the last three years, Applicant has 
made significant changes in his life.  He married in 2003.  He discontinued use of marijuana in 2004.  He bought a car and a home.  He received a major promotion from his employer, one that 
carries with it increased responsibility for himself and other employees, and compensation.  Applicant is now 26 and is a more mature decision-maker.  He stated an intent not to use drugs in the 
future.  I found his testimony to be both believable and credible.  I believe Applicant will remain drug free in the future.  I, therefore, have no reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant's 
willingness and ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests.  I conclude it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.</P>
