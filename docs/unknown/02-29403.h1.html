<P>Applicant, a certified public accountant who owns his own business, was born in Pakistan.  He has lived in the United States since he was approximately 15 
years old, and he received his secondary, college, and graduate education in the United States.  Applicant's father, who is in poor health, and two of his siblings 
are residents and citizens of Pakistan.  His wife is a U.S. citizen.  Her father, who is in fragile health, three of her siblings, and an aunt are residents and citizens 
of Pakistan.  Applicant and his wife are in frequent telephone contact with their fathers and solicitous of their health.  Applicant's continuing ties of affection 
and obligation to family members in Pakistan create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Clearance 
is denied.  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On January 31, 2003, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-29403.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-29403.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive.  Applicant initially answered the SOR in writing on March 22, 2003 and requested that 
his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  On July 23, 2003, Applicant requested a hearing before an administrative judge instead of a decision 
on the record.  The case was assigned to me on October 29, 2003.  On November 26, 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on December 8, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains eight allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, of the Directive.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant 
admitted seven of the allegations and denied one allegation.  At his hearing, Applicant supplied evidence that his wife had recently become a U.S. citizen, plans 
to relinquish as soon as possible her Pakistani passport, and has applied for a U.S. passport, thus providing mitigation to the allegation at &para; 1.c. of the SOR.  He 
also admitted that in addition to the 1994 and 1999 trips to Pakistan alleged in SOR &para; 1.h., he had also traveled to Pakistan in 2002 to visit family and to 
London in 2003 to visit his father and sister, who had traveled there from Pakistan.  Applicant's admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Pakistan and came to the United States with his father, who was employed by the government of Pakistan.  He is now 52 years old and 
has lived in the United States since his early teens.  Applicant married first in 1981.  He was divorced in1990.  Applicant married again in 1994.  His second 
wife was born in Pakistan.  Applicant and his second wife are American citizens.  They are the parents of a young child.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a certified public accountant.  He holds a master's degree in business administration, which he earned with distinction.  In 1990, he founded his 
own accounting business.  The business is a government contractor.  Applicant has not held a security clearance in the past.  He has twice served as an officer in 
a business group comprised of Pakistani-American businessmen.  He has been recognized as an outstanding businessman by numerous civic and professional 
organizations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother, a resident and citizen of Pakistan, died in September 2001.  His father and two siblings are residents and citizens of Pakistan.  Before his 
mother died, Applicant sent his parents approximately $300 to $600 per year.  His father now lives alone and is in ill health, and Applicant speaks with him by 
telephone twice a month.  One of his siblings, a brother, is an accountant who works for a government entity in Pakistan.  His other sibling living in Pakistan, a 
sister, is a homemaker and part-time English teacher.  He speaks on the telephone with his siblings in Pakistan three or four times a year.  Applicant also has a 
brother who is a United States citizen and a sister who is a citizen of the United Kingdom.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife's father, three of her siblings, and an aunt are residents and citizens of Pakistan.  Applicant's father-in-law is in deteriorating health.  
Applicant's wife speaks with her father in Pakistan every two weeks.  She traveled to Pakistan with her daughter in 2002 to visit her father and other relatives.  
In 1994, 1999, and 2002, Applicant traveled to Pakistan to visit relatives.  On his 2002 trip, he traveled to Pakistan to visit his father and to escort his wife and 
child back from a visit with the wife's relatives.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant reported on his SF-86 that he owned, for investment purposes, two parcels of undeveloped land in Pakistan.  He stated that he owned one parcel 
solely and he owned the other parcel jointly with his brother in Pakistan.  At his hearing, Applicant presented documentation to show that he had relinquished to 
his brother the property of which he had been the sole owner.  He also stated he was mistaken and did not own the second property jointly with his brother. 
Instead, he reported that the property was owned entirely by his brother and sister-in-law.  Applicant has no financial holdings or bank accounts in Pakistan.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant stated that he would not relinquish classified information even if members of his family or his wife's family were threatened with physical harm.  He 
said he would notify appropriate authorities if his family members were threatened in an attempt to force him to divulge classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  In 
evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The 
decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely an 
indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Adjudicative Guideline B, Foreign Influence, applies to this case.  Under Guideline B, a security concern may exist when an individual's immediate family and 
other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These 
situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries 
or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or 
pressure.  &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B identifies several conditions that could raise security concerns:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An immediate family member of a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country (&para; 
E2.A2.1.2.1.);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The individual seeking clearance shares living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or 
duress exists (&para; E2.A2.1.2.2.);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Relatives, cohabitants, or associates who are connected with any foreign government. (&para; E2.A2.1.2.3.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The individual seeking clearance displays conduct which may make him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a foreign government (&para; 
E2.A2.1.2.6.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B mitigating conditions that might apply to this case include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A determination that the immediate family members (spouse, mother, brothers) or associates in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be 
exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the United States  (&para; E2.A2.1.3.1);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent (&para; E2.A2.1.3.3.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged, under Guideline B of the Directive, that Applicant's close familial and friendship ties with and obligations to citizens of Pakistan 
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">created the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  The SOR alleged that Applicant's father and two 
siblings reside in and are citizens of Pakistan (&para;&para; 1.a. and 1.b.); that his wife is a citizen of Pakistan and currently holds a Pakistani passport (&para; 1.c.); that his 
wife's father, three siblings, and an aunt reside in and are citizens of Pakistan (&para; 1.d.); that his wife maintains telephone contact once every two weeks with her 
family in Pakistan (&para; 1.e.); that Applicant sent money to his parents in Pakistan in recent years (&para; 1.f.); that he owned two investment properties in Pakistan, one 
solely and one jointly with a brother (&para; 1.g.); and that he traveled to Pakistan in 1994 and 1999 to visit his family and father-in-law (&para; 1.h.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A Guideline B security concern exists when an individual seeking clearance is bound by ties of affection, influence, or obligation to immediate family, close 
friends, or professional associates in a foreign country, or to persons in the United States whose first loyalties are to a foreign country.  A person who places a 
high value on family obligations or fidelity to relationships in another country may be vulnerable to duress by the intelligence service of the foreign country or 
by agents from that country engaged in industrial espionage, terrorism or other criminal activity.  The more faithful an individual is to family ties and 
obligations, the more likely the chance that the ties might be exploited to the detriment of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's case requires the recognition that Pakistan and the United States have a special political and economic relationship.<A HREF="02-29403.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  At the same time it is also 
necessary to recognize that Pakistan is on the front lines in the war against international and regional terrorism and, despite the efforts of its government, there 
are individuals and groups within Pakistan who have acted and continue to act in a hostile manner to U.S. security interests.<A HREF="02-29403.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits allegations of the SOR which raise security concerns under Guideline B, &para;&para; E2.A2.1.2.1, E2.A2.1.2.2, E2.A2. 1.2.3, and E2.A2.1.2.6.  His 
father and two siblings are residents and citizens  of Pakistan.  While his wife is now a U.S. citizen, her father, three siblings and an aunt are also residents and 
citizens of Pakistan.  Because both of their fathers are in ill or declining health, Applicant and his wife are in frequent telephone contact with them.  In 
December of 2002, Applicant's wife, while still a citizen of Pakistan, traveled with her young daughter to visit her family in Pakistan, and Applicant traveled to 
Pakistan to visit his family and to escort his wife and daughter back to the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is close to his father and solicitous of his health and well being.  In the past, when his mother was alive, he sent his parents money each year, 
although he has sent no money to his family in Pakistan since September 2001.  Applicant has traveled to Pakistan three times in the past 10 years to visit his 
father and other relatives.  In 2003 he traveled to London to visit his father and his two sisters.  Applicant's filial conduct toward his father and his past financial 
support of his parents have the potential to make him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a foreign government under disqualifying condition &para; 
E.2.A.2.1.2.6.  His wife's relationship with her father and her family in Pakistan creates the potential for adverse foreign influence upon Applicant pursuant to 
disqualifying condition &para; E2.A2.1.2.2.  The record indicates that mitigating condition &para; E2.A2.1.3.1 applies only in part to the facts of Applicant's case.  While 
his widowed father and father-in-law are not agents of a foreign power, they are in fragile health and could be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could 
force Applicant to choose between loyalty to them and the United States.  While Applicant has stated that hypothetically he would not be vulnerable to such 
pressure by a foreign power, his actions toward his father and father-in-law make it clear that his relationship with them is not casual and infrequent but intense 
and seriously concerned for their welfare.  Thus, mitigating condition &para; E2.A2.1.3.3. does not apply to Applicant's relationship with his father, nor does it apply 
to his relationship with his wife's father.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has one brother who is a resident and citizen of Pakistan and who works for a Pakistani governmental entity.  Since the brother's livelihood likely 
depends upon his government connection, a security concern is raised under disqualifying condition &para; E2.A2.1.2.3.  This disqualifying condition is mitigated in 
part.  While, pursuant to mitigating condition &para; E2.A2.1.3.1., nothing in the record indicates that Applicant's brother is an agent of a foreign power, there is no 
evidence to show that he is not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that might force Applicant to choose between him and his well-being 
and his loyalty to the United States.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At his hearing, Applicant supplied persuasive evidence to show that his wife is now a U.S. citizen, has taken steps to apply for a U.S. passport, and will destroy 
her Pakistani passport when she receives her U.S. passport.  By providing notarized real estate documents from Pakistan, indicating that his land interests would 
be transferred to his brother's ownership after Eid holidays, Applicant provided persuasive evidence that he has relinquished all real property interests he had in 
Pakistan.  Thus, SOR allegations 1.c. and 1.g. are concluded for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Nothing in Applicant's testimony or demeanor suggested he was not a loyal American citizen and a credit to his adopted country.  However, despite Applicant's 
sincere demeanor and his assurances that he is not a security risk, the circumstances of his family situation argue otherwise.  He was unable to put forward 
evidence that could mitigate the security concerns discussed herein and demonstrate that he would not be vulnerable to foreign influence that would result in the 
compromise of classified information.  Accordingly, allegations in subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., 1.e. 1.f., and 1.h. under Guideline B of the SOR are concluded 
against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1.  Guideline B: AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P>
