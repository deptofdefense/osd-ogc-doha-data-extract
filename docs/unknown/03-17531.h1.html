<P>In August of 2001, the Applicant was arrested for Making or Uttering a False or Forged Prescription or Written Order.  He subsequently pled guilty to this 
charge.  The Applicant was less than candid with the Government, however, as to his forging of the prescription, in a sworn statement executed in December of 
2001, and again in a sworn statement executed in February of 2002.  These wilful falsifications are violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001.  Although the Applicant's 
isolated Drug Involvement is not recent, there is a fairly recent pattern of Personal Conduct and Criminal Conduct.  Mitigation is not shown; and as such, his 
clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 23, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on January 5, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on July 6, 2004.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt 
of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on July 29, 2004, and Applicant's reply was received on August 27, 2004.  The case was received by the 
undersigned for resolution on January 6, 2005.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's past Drug Involvement, and his Criminal and Personal 
Conduct militate against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant denies the underlying facts upon which his guilty plea was predicated, and denies 
any wilful falsifications.]</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of Relevant Material and Applicant's Response.  The Applicant is 37 years 
of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline H - Drug Involvement</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  The Applicant was prescribed the drug, Percocet, in August of 2001 (Item 5 at page 1).  The Applicant avers the following: "My normal doctor was not in 
town at the time, and I was due to go on a trip.  When I got the prescription I decided to alter it from twelve of the Percocet pills to reflect 120 of the pills.  
When I took the prescription to the pharmacy, I was arrested with the forged prescription" (<EM>id</EM>).  In January of 2002, the Applicant pled guilty to Making </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or 
Uttering a False or Forged Prescription or Written Order</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> (Items 9 and 10).  The case was continued for one year; and upon a showing of drug free good 
behavior, the charge was reduced (<EM>id</EM>, and Item 3 at page 1).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct &amp; Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a. and 3.a.  In a signed sworn statement executed in December of 2001, the Applicant averred, "I did not pay attention to the prescription nor the amount" 
(Item 7 at page 4).  This was a wilful falsification as the Applicant had, in fact, altered the prescription (Item 5 at page 1).  This wilful falsification is also a 
violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.b. and 3.a.  In a second signed sworn statement executed in February of 2002, the Applicant averred, "I was arrested . . . and charged with uttering a false 
prescription. . . . I was innocent of this charge" (Item 6 at page 1).  This was a wilful falsification as the Applicant had, in fact, altered the prescription (Item 5 at 
page 1).  This wilful falsification is also a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.c. and 3.a.  Finally, in a third signed sworn statement executed in September of 2002, the Applicant admitted, "When I got the prescription I decided to alter it 
from twelve of the Percocet pills to reflect 120 of the pills" (Item 5 at page 1).  There is no evidence that the Applicant did not also tell the truth during his 
interview, as is alleged, prior to executing this sworn statement.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant offers little in the way of mitigation.  In his reply to the Government's FORM, the Applicant maintains his innocence, despite his admission in 
his September 2002 sworn statement that he altered the prescription (Item 5 at page 1).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive,"[each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant 
and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out its case under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), which 
establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's 
adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct 
evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct is conduct involving questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  The 
commission of Criminal Conduct also reflects a lack of judgment and discretion.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a 
security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the 
law in his private affairs, there then exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering first the Applicant's Drug Involvement, he altered a drug prescription in August of 2001.  The first disqualifying condition is therefore applicable 
as there was "drug abuse;" i.e., "use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction."  However, the first and second mitigating 
conditions are also applicable as the "drug involvement was not recent," more than three years ago, and it "was an isolated . . . event."  As mitigation is shown, 
Guideline H is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same can not be said, however, as to his Personal Conduct and related Criminal Conduct.  The Applicant was not truthful as to his altering the prescription 
when he executed his December 2001 sworn statement, and he continued this ruse when he executed his February 2002 sworn statement.  The third 
disqualifying condition under Personal Conduct is therefore applicable; i.e., "[d]eliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and 
material to an investigator . . . in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination."  Under Criminal Conduct, the first disqualifying 
condition is clearly applicable as there are "[a]llegations . . . of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged."  I can find no 
countervailing mitigating conditions here as the last violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 was fairly recent, less than two years ago; and as there were repeated violations 
of this Federal Statute, the criminality was not "an isolated incident."  The Applicant's repeated lack of candor is clearly of security significance; and as such, 
Guidelines E and J are found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his Personal Conduct and related Criminal Conduct.  The 
Applicant has thus not met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines E and J, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate 
burden of persuasion under Guidelines E and J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>
