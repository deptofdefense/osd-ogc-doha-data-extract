<P>The Applicant was born, raised, and educated in Italy, and served in the Italian Air Force, all prior to his moving to the US and 
becoming a naturalized US citizen.  The Applicant believed his foreign citizenship continued after he became a US citizen, but he was 
mistaken.  He lost his Italian citizenship when he took the oath of US naturalization, so he is not a dual citizen.  The Applicant did have 
an Italian passport which was granted to him prior to his United States naturalization which has both expired and been annulled.  The 
Applicant owns real estate and bank accounts in Italy but his foreign assets are not as significant as his US financial interests.  Contacts 
with his cousins who reside in Italy are casual and infrequent.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On September 8, 2000, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, 
stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="00-0359.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On March 22, 2001, the Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case 
was assigned to me on April 18, 2001.  Notice of Hearing was issued on April 26, 2001, scheduling the hearing for May 15, 2001.  
The Applicant's counsel requested a continuance, which, for good cause, was granted.  Notice of Hearing was issued on June 4, 2001 
rescheduling the hearing, for June 20, 2001. </P> 
 
<P>At the hearing on June 20, 2001, the Government's case consisted of two exhibits (Gov Ex).  The Applicant relied on his own testimony 
and eight documents. (App Ex).  A transcript (tr) of the hearing was received on July 23, 2001.  Corrections to the transcript were 
received from Applicant's counsel on September 4, 2001, and Department Counsel's comments were received on September 5, 2001. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The SOR alleges foreign influence (Guideline B) and foreign preference (Guideline C).  The Applicant admits some of the allegations 
and denies the rest.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant is 65 years old and has worked for a defense contractor since May 1971.  He is seeking to maintain a top secret security 
clearance.  His recent performance evaluations have been outstanding. (App Ex F)  He has a reputation for being honest, loyal, open, 
hard working, trustworthy, and for personal integrity and ethics above reproach.  He is a valuable asset to his job, working long and 
hard hours with excellent results. (App Ex H)</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant was born in Italy.  His father was a civil engineer, his mother a school teacher and his brother had Down's Syndrome.  
All were Italian citizens. (tr 61)  From August 1959 until February 1961, he served in the Italian Air Force as a lieutenant, which was 
required by Italian law.  The Applicant received two Ph.D. degrees in Italy and studied in London and Germany before moving to the 
United States in January 1964. (App Ex C)  Except for his military service time, the Applicant has never worked in Italy.  In September 
1977 he became a naturalized US citizen. </P> 
 
<P>The Applicant had an Italian passport prior to 1977, which was expired for eight to ten years when he requested it be renewed in May 
1994. (tr 44)  The Applicant never used his Italian passport for travel. (tr 42)  Not aware Applicant had taken the oath of citizenship in 
the United States, the passport was renewed, to expire in February 1999. (App Ex B) In March 2001, the Applicant sent his passport 
to Department Counsel.  Department Counsel advised him to turn it into the Italian consulate, which he did.  On May 4, 2001, the 
passport was annulled by the consulate (App Ex B) and returned to him.  On May 11, 2001, the Consulate General made a declaration 
the Applicant was not an Italian citizen. (App Ex A) </P> 
 
<P>In December 2000, after receiving the SOR, the Applicant investigated how to renounce his Italian citizenship and discovered he had 
not been an Italian citizen since 1977, when he became a naturalized US citizen. (tr 30)  Under Italian law, Italian citizenship is 
automatically rescinded when foreign citizenship is acquired.  The Applicant had operated under the mistaken belief his Italian citizenship 
continued to exist unless formally renounced. (tr 34)  The Applicant formally rescinded his former Italian citizenship by contacting the 
Italian consulate in May 2001. (App Ex A) </P> 
 
<P>When his parents died,<A HREF="00-0359.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> the Applicant inherited, with his brother, several acres<A HREF="00-0359.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> of unimproved real estate in the mountains of Italy 
which had been in his family for 700 years.  Following his parents' deaths his brother continued to live in the apartment where the 
brother had been residing with his parents prior to their deaths.  Following his brother's death in 1984, the Applicant continued to rent 
their apartment for $300.00 per month.  In 1996, the apartment was offered for sale by the quasi- national company that owed the 
building.  The quasi-national company was replaced by a private association. (tr 65)  In 1998,<A HREF="00-0359.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> the Applicant bought the apartment at a 
cost of $110,000.00. (tr 26, 55)  He also inherited a second apartment from his parents and brother. (tr 57, 58)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In 1973 or 1974, the Applicant purchased two apartments in Italy (tr 25, 41) which were split into three apartments.  The apartments 
together valued at $90,000.00 are in long term leases.  Two of the apartments are leased full time and one is leased part time.  The 
Applicant receives $5,000.00 yearly in rental income, which pays the real estate taxes on the properties. (tr 48, 57) These three 
apartments plus one inherited and the one purchased in 1998 makes five apartments owned by the Applicant in Italy.  The five 
apartments have a combined value of $200,000.00. (tr 47, 58) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In 1984, when his brother died, the Applicant received his brother's car.  At Christmas time in 2000, the Applicant passed the title of 
the car to a demolition company. (tr 53) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant has two cousins, who are citizens of, live in Italy.  His cousins are sisters ages 65 and 70, who he last saw five and a half 
years ago and last had telephone contact with three and a half years ago.  He does not send them birthday or holiday cards.  One sister 
had worked for a bank and his other sister was a housewife. (tr 61)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Since 1992, the Applicant has been a registered voter in the US. (App Ex D)  He has never voted in Italy. (tr 24)  The Applicant 
belongs to a local theater group, owns a car in the US and has a state driver's license.  He owns no vehicles in Italy and does not have 
an Italian driver's license. He has $425,000.00+ in a 401-K plan and two other accounts totaling almost $8,000.00, all in the US. (App 
Ex G)  He maintains a bank account of approximately $6,000.00 in Italy into which he receives rent payments and pays the expenses of 
his foreign real estate.  He also maintains a savings account of approximately $35,000.00 in Italy. (tr 68)  The Applicant owns no real 
estate in the US.  He has no medical, welfare, social security, or other benefits in Italy. (Gov Ex 2, tr 25, 28) He has never participated 
in the Italian health program.  He belongs to no organizations in Italy. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant has a US passport which he uses to travel abroad.  The Applicant visits Italy approximately twice a year.  In 1992, he 
went to Italy in January and June; in 1993, in June; in 1994 in June and December; in 1995, in June and December; in 1996, in 
February; in 1997, in January and July; in 1998, in September and December; in 1999, the Applicant's trip started in December 1998 
ended in mid-January 1999; in 2000, in June and December.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead, they are to be applied by 
Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security.  In making overall common sense determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the 
evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of 
factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not only has the burden of proving any 
controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also demonstrate the facts proven have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security 
worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is 
to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence 
of a particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a 
case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this 
case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Foreign Preference (Guideline C)  The Concern:  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country 
over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the 
United States. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include E2.A3.1.2.: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  2.  Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;  E2.A3.1.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  3.  Military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country;  E2.A3.1.2.3. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  4.  Accepting educational, medical, or other benefits, such as retirement and social welfare, from a foreign country;  E2.A3.1.2.4. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  E2.A3.1.3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">1.  Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country;  E2.A3.1.3.1. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  2.  Indicators of possible foreign preference (e.g., foreign military service) occurred before obtaining United States citizenship;  
E2.A3.1.3.2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Foreign Influence (Guideline B)  The Concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, 
and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be 
subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations 
if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include (E2.A2.1.2.):</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">1.  An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident 
or present in, a foreign country; E2.A2.1.2.1. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  8.  A substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign-owned or -operated business that could make the individual vulnerable 
to foreign influence. E2.A2.1.2.8.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  E2.A2.1.3. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">   3.  Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent. E2.A2.1.3.3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">5.  Foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities.E2.A2.1.3.5.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government 
meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant who must remove that doubt and establish his security suitability 
with substantial evidence in explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of 
guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and 
confidence.  Where the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the 
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States 
Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands the Court's rationale, 
doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline C, the security eligibility of an applicant is placed into question when an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a 
preference for a foreign country over the United States; he or she may then be prone to provide information or make decisions that are 
harmful to the interests of the United States. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant was born, raised, and educated in Italy, and served in the Italian Air Force.  All of these events took place before he 
moved to the US in 1964 and becoming a naturalized US citizen in 1977.  Mitigation Conditions (MC) 1<A HREF="00-0359.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN> and 2<A HREF="00-0359.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN> apply to these 
events.  The Applicant did have an Italian passport granted to him prior to him becoming a US citizen, which he did not use.  The 
passport expired in 1999 and was annulled by the Italian consulate in May 2001.  The Applicant did have the mistaken belief his Italian 
citizenship continued to exist, after becoming a US citizen, until he renounced it.  This was a mistake, the Applicant had actually lost his 
foreign citizenship in 1977, when he became a naturalized US citizen. (tr 30)  Under Italian law, Italian citizenship is automatically 
rescinded when foreign citizenship is acquired.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant formally rescinded his former Italian citizenship. (App Ex A)  In May 2001, the Italian Consulate General made a 
declaration the Applicant was not an Italian citizen. (App Ex A)  The Applicant has done more than merely expressing a willingness to 
renounce dual citizenship, MC 4,<A HREF="00-0359.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN> he took steps to ensure he is not a dual citizen.  Since the Applicant does not maintain dual 
citizenship, and never used his Italian passport for travel after becoming a United States citizen, I find for him as to SOR subparagraphs 
1.a., 1.b, and 1.c.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant own five apartments in Italy valued at approximately $200,000.00.  Some of the apartments are rented and the rental 
income received pays the real estate taxes owed on the properties.  He also owns some undeveloped, mountainous real estate valued at 
less than $500.00, which he inherited.  The Applicant is not an Italian citizen and has not been one since 1977.  Therefore, as a matter 
of law, he could not rely on Italian citizenship to afford him privileged protection of financial assets, including real estate interests, in Italy.  
I find for the Applicant as to SOR subparagraph 1.d. <SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>  The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline B, (Foreign Influence).  Under Guideline B, the security 
eligibility of an applicant is placed into question when the person has immediate family members who are citizens of and/or residing in a 
foreign country.  Additionally, although not alleged in the context of guideline B, it is noted that Applicant has financial interests in a 
foreign country which could raise his vulnerability to foreign influence. </P> 
 
<P>A security risk may exist where the Applicant is bound by affection, influence, or obligation to individuals who are not citizens of the 
United States or may be subject to duress.  The Applicant does have two cousins who are citizens of and reside in Italy whom the 
Applicant last saw five and a half years ago and last had telephone contact with three and a half years ago.  He does not send them 
birthday or holiday cards.  MC 3<A HREF="00-0359.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN> applies since the Applicant's contacts with his cousins are casual and infrequent. </P> 
 
<P>The risk posed by the Applicant's foreign financial interests and contacts are balanced against the Applicant's financial interests and 
contacts in the US.  The Applicant does own approximately $200,000.00 worth of real estate and has $31,000.00 in two bank 
accounts in Italy.  In the US, he has $425,000.00+ in a 401-K retirement plan and two additional accounts totaling approximately 
$8,000.00.  The Applicant is a registered voter in the US and has never voted in Italy.  He owns a car in the US and has a state driver's 
license.  He owns no vehicles in Italy and does not have an Italian driver's license.  He has lived in the US since 1964--37 years--but 
does take trips to Italy every six months.  The Applicant does not maintain a foreign citizenship to protect his financial interests.  In 
balancing the Applicant's financial interests and contacts, I find his foreign financial interests, although not minimal, are insufficient to 
affect the individual's security responsibilities and find MC 5<A HREF="00-0359.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN> applies.  I find for the Applicant as to the allegation of foreign financial 
interests raised during the hearing but not listed in the SOR. </P> 
 
<P>  In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity 
at the time of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the 
motivation for the conduct; the frequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </P>
