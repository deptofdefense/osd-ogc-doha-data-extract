<P>The Applicant has done everything possible to renounce his foreign citizenship, and surrendered his foreign passport.  He has no financial interest in the country 
of his birth.  His mother and two sisters are citizens of and reside in the country of his birth.  His brother is immigrating to Canada.  There is no evidence that 
they are connected with any country's government, or are in position to be exploited by any country.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 26 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an undated Answer to the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on August 21, 2002.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 9, 2002, and the case was heard on October 8, 
2002.  The Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who called six witnesses to testify on his behalf.  The 
transcript was received on October 16, 2002.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's alleged foreign preference and perceived foreign influence 
militate against the granting of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN> 45 years of age, has a 
Bachelor of Science Degree from an American university, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline C - Foreign Preference</SPAN></P> 
<P>1.a.~1.c.  The Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in October of 1985 (Transcript (TR) at page 34 lines 12~16, and Government Exhibit (GX) 3 at page 
2).  Since becoming a U.S. citizen, he traveled to the country of his birth in 1992, 1995 and again in 2000 (TR at page 23 line 25 to page 24 line 14, at page 43 
lines 23~25, and GX 3 at page 3).  He used his Country A passport in 1992 and 1995, and his U.S. passport in 2000 to visit his ailing mother (<EM>id</EM>).  He used his 
Country A passport in 1992 and 1995, as "it would have been suicidal" to use his U.S. passport (TR at page 24 lines 2~7).  He has recently done everything 
possible to renounce his Country A citizenship, and has returned his Country A passport to that Country's Consulate (Applicant's Exhibits (AppXs) A and B).</P> 
<P>1.d. and 1.e.  As to financial interests in Country A, he has none (TR at page 36 line 15 to page 37 line 5, and page 44 lines 6~16).  He gave one of his sisters, 
who reside in Country A, a Power of Attorney to settle their deceased father's affairs (<EM>id</EM>).  The proceeds were used to purchase medicines for his ailing mother 
(<EM>ibid</EM>).</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN></P> 
<P>2.a. and 2.b.  The Applicant's 82 year old mother and two sisters are citizens of and reside in Country A (TR at page 24 line 21 to page 25 line 3, at page 30 
lines 7~12, and at page 42 line 1 to page 43 line 18).  One sister owns a small toy shop and the other is a teacher.  Neither of his sisters nor his mother have any 
connection to Country A's government, or are in a position to be exploited by Country A (<EM>id</EM>).  His brother is a lawyer, who has been granted Canadian 
citizenship, and is in the process of immigrating to Canada (<EM>ibid</EM>).  He is not in a position to be exploited by any foreign government.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></P> 
<P>The Applicant offered the testimony of six individuals who are his friends and associates (TR at page 10 line 25 to page 16 line 13, and at page 46 line 15 to 
page 68 line 17).  They all think most highly of the Applicant, and would recommend him for a position of trust (<EM>id</EM>).</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN> should be followed in every case <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Preference</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  The exercise of dual citizenship;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  An immediate family member . . . is a citizen of . . . a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), . . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference), and Guideline B (foreign influence), which establishes doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to 
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates a foreign preference, or who is subject to a foreign influence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are 
harmful to the interests of the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all 
security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has done everything possible to renounced his dual citizenship.  In conjunction with this renunciation, he surrendered his foreign country 
passport to that country's consulate.  Although he was forced to use his Country A passport to visit his ailing mother in 1992 and 1995, more recently, in 2000, 
he has begun to use his U.S. passport for trips to Country A.  I therefore conclude that the Applicant has not only met but has clearly surpassed the requirement 
of the last mitigating condition under Guideline C, which merely requires that he "express a willingness to renounce dual citizenship."  He is not now a dual 
national, but only a U.S. citizen with a U.S. passport.  Guideline C is therefore found in his favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's mother and two sisters are citizens of and reside in Country A.  They have no connection with the government of the country of his birth; and 
there is no evidence that their presence in that country can be exploited by that government.  In addition, I conclude that it would be unlikely that the Applicant 
would even consider any such attempt at exploitation.  Guideline B is also found in the Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his alleged foreign preference, and foreign influence.  The Applicant 
has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines B and C, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion 
under Guidelines B and C.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security
