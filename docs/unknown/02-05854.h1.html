<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Fifty one year old Applicant has abused marijuana - including purchase, possession, and use, and in a  December 2001 declaration she stated that she intends to 
continue to use marijuana in the future. Furthermore, the application of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 disqualifies her from eligibility.</SPAN> Applicant's alcohol abuse has resulted

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 19, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted or denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated March 14, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. She requested that her case be decided on the written 
record in lieu of a hearing. On July 8, 2003, Department Counsel prepared the Department's written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM) <A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided to Applicant, and she was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. 
Applicant filed no response to the FORM . The case was assigned to me on September 4, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Department Counsel offered seven documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-7). Applicant has offered no documentary evidence into the record. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the SOR. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> The SOR contains eight allegations, 1.a. 
through 1.h., under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and one allegation, 2.a., under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">admitted</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and upon due 
consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is 51 years old. She is employed by a defense contractor, and she seeks to retain a DoD security clearance in connection with her employment in the 
defense sector.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">abuses illegal substances. Applicant first used marijuana in 
1972 when she was 18 years old. During the period form 1971 to 1981 she used marijuana approximately 2 times a week. From 1981 until December 2001 she 
used marijuana approximately one time during every three to four week period. Applicant stated in the signed, sworn statement she made to a DSS agent in 
December 2001, "I never stopped using marijuana because I do not see that there is anything wrong with it."  She also said, "I have intention of using marijuana 
in the future . . ."  Based on these statements and the fact that Applicant gave no affirmative indication that she would not use marijuana in the future in her 
answer to the SOR, I conclude that she has continued using marijuana after her 2001 statement, and she will continue to use marijuana in the future (Exhibits 3 
and 6).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant purchased some of the marijuana that she used on three occasions from 1981 through 1996. Applicant also continued to use marijuana, even after she 
applied for a security clearance (Exhibit 6).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant used LSD three times in the 1970's, which she recalls that she purchased from a friend. She also used cocaine, and while she furnished some 
conflicting information as to when she used it, the evidence shows that she first used it in the 1970's, and  she last used it in approximately 1996 or 1997 
(Exhibits 6). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she abuses alcohol.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In April 2001, Applicant consumed approximately five glasses of rum and Coke over a four hour period each day. Thereafter, Applicant began to drink three 
rum and Coke drinks during her lunch period, and then she would report back to work in an intoxicated state, which affected her work in that she would not be 
able to think and function in a focused manner. Based on her sense that alcohol was causing her problems, Applicant attended Alcoholics Anonymous for a 
period of time in 2001.  Applicant continues to consume one to four alcoholic beverages in a four hour period, approximately three times a week (Exhibit 6). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to 
an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Guideline H (Drug Involvement) </STRONG> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Concern: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. 
Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(E2.A8.1.1.2.1.) drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or 
cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens); and(E2.A8.1.1.2.2.) inhalants and other similar substances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(E2.A8.1.2.1.) any drug abuse (see above definition);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(E2.A8.1.2.2.) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(E2.A8.1.2.5.) Failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by a credentialed medical professional. Recent drug involvement, 
especially following the granting of a security clearance, or an expressed intent not to discontinue use, will almost invariably result in an unfavorable 
determination.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(None)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">On June 7, 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a Memorandum, <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM>Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances 
as Mandated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. The memorandum provides policy guidance for the 
implementation of Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United States 
Code, to add a new section (10 U.S.C. &sect; 986) that precludes the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense under specific 
circumstances. The situation described above involves one of those specific circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Guideline G (Alcohol consumption)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the 
risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(E2.A7.1.2.2.) Alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(E2.A7.1.2.5.) Habitual of binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">None</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly<STRONG> </STRONG>consistent<STRONG> </STRONG>with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day. The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and conduct that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future." The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this 
order...shall be </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between Applicant's conduct and 
the continued holding of a security clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM></EM> case. Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that Applicant has used illegal drugs for many years under (Guideline 
H) and that she has used alcohol to excess (Guideline G). Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or 
mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against her.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">With respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case. Applicant's improper and illegal drug 
abuse, including the purchase, possession, and use of marijuana, as well as the purchase and use of LSD and cocaine, is of concern, especially in light of her 
desire to have access to the nation's secrets. Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to her illegal substance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement 
Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A8.1.2.1. (<EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">any drug abuse</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">), and DC E2.A8.1.2.2. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, 
purchase, sale, or distribution</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's stated  intention to continue using marijuana in the future clearly falls within DC E2.A8.1.2.5. (<EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Failure to successfully complete a drug treatment 
program prescribed by a credentialed medical professional. Recent drug involvement, especially following the granting of a security clearance, or an expressed 
intent not to discontinue use, will almost invariably result in an unfavorable determination</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">). I do not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC) applies to 
guideline H.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Finally, under the circumstances herein, Applicant's lengthy period of illegal substance abuse plus her indication as recently as December 2001 that she will 
continue to use marijuana brings her within the scope of provision 2 of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 in that she </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">is an unlawful user of a controlled substance.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Accordingly,

of impaired judgment. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">I do not find that any MC applies to Guideline G.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant continues to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">consume alcohol on a regular basis,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> consuming one to four alcoholic beverages in a four hour period, approximately three times a week.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> 
Applicant has a demonstrated history of drinking to excess, and she presents no credible evidence to support a conclusion she has reformed her habit. Paragraph

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">On balance, it is concluded that Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing her request for a security clearance. Accordingly, the
