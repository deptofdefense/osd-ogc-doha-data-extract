<P>The Applicant abused alcohol for several years before March 2001.  In March 2001 he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence.  He has been abstinent for 
over two years, has successfully attended outpatient alcohol treatment, has a favorable prognosis from the same doctor who diagnosed him as alcohol 
dependent, and has considerable favorable mitigating evidence.  Adverse inference is overcome.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 27, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on April 4, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was received by the undersigned on August 19, 2003, and a 
Notice of Hearing was issued on September 12, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A hearing was held on September 18, 2003, at which the Government presented four documentary exhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also 
submitted eight exhibits.  The transcript was received on September 29, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 45, married and has a Master of Arts degree in applied mathematics.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Deputy Team Lead, and he 
seeks to retain a Top Secret-level DoD security clearance previously granted in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  
The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits 
and the live testimony.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol abuse)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses 
intoxicants to excess.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant first began using alcohol to excess when he was attending college in the late 1970s.  After he received his Master's degree and married, his 
alcohol use decreased.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In about 1993 the Applicant began traveling frequently for business.  During these business trips his drinking increased markedly.  He primarily drank when he 
was out of town and did not drink to excess at home.  During the 1990s, on two occasions, the Applicant was talked to informally about his drinking by fellow 
employees.  (Transcript at 34-37.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant continued this pattern of excessive drinking while traveling for business until March 6, 2001.  On that date the Applicant was arrested for 
Driving While Under the Influence of Alcohol.  The Applicant was granted a deferred prosecution and was ordered to attend a Alcohol Information School.  
(Government Exhibits 2 and 3.)  The Applicant stopped drinking immediately after his arrest.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Instead of attending an Alcohol Information School, the Applicant elected to go into an intensive outpatient alcohol treatment program at a hospital.  The 
medical director of the chemical program, a doctor, diagnosed the Applicant as being alcohol dependent when he entered treatment in July 2001.  (Government 
Exhibit 4, Transcript at 21-24.)  The Applicant testified about his treatment:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The program had three parts to it.  The first part was an intensive, I think you had to have 80 hours over two months.  I entered the [hospital] outpatient program 
which met four days a week, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, for eight weeks, three hours a night.  We got there about six and finished by nine.  After that I 
completed that, the next step was a six month period where you had to have weekly aftercare.  There was a two hour meeting that I would attend at home on a 
weekly basis and then after six months, you had to have a monthly interaction and I used the [hospital] aftercare program on a monthly basis.  (Transcript at 20-21.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The medical director of the program, and the continuing care coordinator, submitted statements on the Applicant's behalf.  The medical director states, "As [the 
Applicant] has more than two years of sobriety, his prognosis of staying sober is excellent."  (Applicant's Exhibit F.)  The continuing care coordinator writes, 
"[The Applicant] entered our program on July, 2001, has stayed closely connected to [the hospital] since that time and has had continuous sobriety. [The 
Applicant] is very comfortable with his sobriety and is very active in his continuing care group.  He is working a strong recovery program and it is a pleasure to 
be able to participate in his recovery."  (Applicant's Exhibit G.)  The Applicant intends on going to aftercare on a monthly basis.  He is comfortable with his 
sobriety and with being a non-drinker.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several of the Applicant's co-workers, and current and former supervisors, all senior executives in the defense industry, submitted written statements on the 
Applicant's behalf.  All of these individuals recommend the Applicant for a position of trust and responsibility.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Director, Plans and Resources, states, "[The Applicant] is a very good team player, with a strong ethical foundation and demonstrated ability to comply 
with both standard engineering processes and company rules and regulations."  (Applicant's Exhibit A.)  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's supervisor when he was arrested also submitted a statement.  This Director, Integrated Defense Systems, a retired Air Force colonel, states:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">[The Applicant] did not hesitate in reporting his DUI to me, nor did he make any excuses.  He fully accepted responsibility for his conduct.  He immediately 
decided to stop drinking, and to pursue a program which would help him address his DUI and his drinking.  I have not seen [the Applicant] take a drink since 
the DUI.  It is well known that he is no longer drinking. [The Applicant] has not had any difficulty in dealing with his decision to stop drinking.  He understands 
the serious nature of his problem, and takes his commitment to sobriety just as seriously.  (Applicant's Exhibit B.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline G (Alcohol consumption)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to 
alcohol abuse;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) the alcohol related incidents do not indicate a pattern;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) following diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with 
aftercare requirements, participates frequently in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization, abstained from alcohol for a period of at least 12 
months, and received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional or licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized 
treatment program.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in act of alcohol abuse or dependence that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has abused alcohol, and been involved in an alcohol 
related incident (Guideline G).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.  The evidence shows that, since he entered treatment in 2001 after his 
single alcohol related arrest, the Applicant has eliminated alcohol consumption.  He has successfully completed an alcohol rehabilitation program and has a 
favorable prognosis from the doctor who is the medical director of the treatment program.  The Applicant's compelling testimony shows that his alcohol abuse 
was situational in nature, that he is determined to remain sober, and that he has learned how to deal with the problems he has with alcohol.  Accordingly, 
mitigating conditions 1, 3 and 4 apply.  In addition, application of the General Factors is appropriate and supports a decision in the Applicant's favor.  The 
Applicant shows considerable evidence of rehabilitation (Factor f), and, under the circumstances of this case, the probability that the Applicant will return to his 
drinking ways are virtually nil (Factor i). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  
Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's 
Statement of Reasons.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</SPAN></P>
