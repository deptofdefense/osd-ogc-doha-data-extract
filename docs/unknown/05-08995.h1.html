<P>On November 25, 2005, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="05-08995.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F, Financial Considerations and 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">January 27, 2006</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on March 29, 2006. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A notice of hearing was issued on

without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Applicant Exhibit (AE) A.  The record was held open until June 14, 2006.  Applicant submitted an additional 30-page document 
which was marked as AE B and admitted without objection. Department Counsel submitted an additional exhibit which was marked as Gov Ex 6.</SPAN> DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 5, 
2006.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his SOR response, Applicant admits to the allegations in SOR &para;&para; 1.a through 1.d but denies the allegations in SOR &para;&para; 2.a and 2.b.  Although he admits he did not list his delinquent debt on his 
security clearance application, he states that the omission was unintentional.  Therefore, I conclude Applicant denied the allegations in SOR &para;&para; 2.a and 2.b. Applicant's admissions are incorporated 
herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is employed as a shipping clerk with a Department of Defense contractor and seeks a security clearance.<A HREF="05-08995.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He has been with his current employer five years.<A HREF="05-08995.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> He is 50 years old and has a

years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?"  He also answered "No" to question "39.  Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 days. Are you currently 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?" </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's background investigation revealed Applicant has four delinquent accounts with a total approximate balance of $12,493.<A HREF="05-08995.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> The accounts included a $531 credit card debt that was charged off

<P>Applicant attempted to resolve his debts through Consumer Credit Counseling.  They advised him to file for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.  On October 10, 2005, he filed for bankruptcy.  He listed total assets 
of $10,772 and total liabilities of $29,419.  He reaffirmed the loan on his truck and continues to make payments.  On January 18, 2006, his debts were discharged.<A HREF="05-08995.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> All of the debts alleged in the SOR

his dates right.<A HREF="05-08995.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and discussed in

age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="05-08995.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> 
Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The applicant has the

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those 
individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication 
that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Financial</STRONG> <STRONG>Considerations  </STRONG> </P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Applicant has had difficulty paying his bills. By the time the SOR was issued he had approximately four delinquent  accounts on his credit report with a total approximate balance of $12,493. Under 
Guideline F, Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1, "A history of not meeting financial obligations," and FC DC 3 E2.A6.1.2.3, "Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts," apply to 
Applicant's case. He experienced difficulty meeting his financial obligations beginning in 2003.</P> 
 
<P>I find the following Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) apply. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3, "The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., 
loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation)," applies. Applicant encountered financial difficulties as a result of an unexpected medical 
condition which put him on disability for at least three months.  His medical condition also forced him to quit his part-time job.  The loss of his part-time job made it more difficult for him to pay his 
debts. </P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4, "The individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control," and FC MC 
E2.A6.1.3.6, "The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts," apply.  Applicant attempted to pay off his debts through consumer credit counseling.  He 
was advised to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  His debts have been discharged.  He has taken steps to save money.  He cancelled his cable subscription. He has no credit card accounts.  He lives within 
his means. Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations concerns.  I find for the Applicant under Guideline F.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard 
classified information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security clearance or in 
other official matters is a security concern.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  </P> 
 
<P>In this case, the record evidence fails to establish Applicant deliberately omitted or concealed information about his delinquent debts. Although his answers to questions 38 and 39 were incorrect, 
Applicant successfully rebutted the allegations that he deliberately provided a false answer. At the hearing he testified he has a faulty memory.  I find his testimony credible that he forgot about these 
debts. Guideline E is decided for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of a person's life to 
make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" 
concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all 
relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>In reaching my decision, I considered all the evidence provided and also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.  
Applicant is a valued employee. While he takes full responsibility for his delinquent debts, his financial situation was aggravated by his medical condition. He sought the assistance of  a credit 
counseling agency and decided to file for bankruptcy based on their advice.  He has taken steps to avoid getting into financial difficulties in the future.  Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the 
evidence in this case that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.<STRONG></STRONG></P>
