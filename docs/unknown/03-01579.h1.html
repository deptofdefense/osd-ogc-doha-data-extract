<P>Applicant admits 10 financial delinquencies, several of which date back to 2000 and 2001.  Another delinquency dates to 1995.  Applicant falsified material 
facts about his financial liabilities on the security clearance application he completed and certified in July 2002.  Applicant's financial problems and his lack of 
candor raise serious security concerns.  Clearance is denied. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On September 22, 2003, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="03-01579.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="03-01579.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 
November 3, 2003,</SPAN> and requested that his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File of Relevant Material 
(FORM) on December 4, 2003.  The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 7.  By letter dated December 12, 2003, a copy of the FORM 
was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant did not submit 
additional information or objections within that time period.  On February 25, 2004, the case was assigned to me for a decision.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains 12 allegations of disqualifying conduct.  Eleven allegations relate to conduct charged under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and one 
allegation related to conduct charged under Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all 12 allegations.  His admissions 
are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 47-year-old electrician employed by a defense contractor.  He was married in 1987.  He and his wife separated in August 1999.  When he 
completed and signed his security clearance (SF-86) in July 2002, he listed his marital status as "separated." It does not appear from the record that the couple 
had any children.  Applicant was unemployed from December 2001 to July 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has numerous debts and admits responsibility for 10 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $7,871.  The financial statement he prepared and 
submitted with his signed, sworn statement indicates he lacks sufficient resources to pay the debts.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed, sworn statement to a special agent of the Defense Security Service, dated November 2002, Applicant identified three debts to medical service 
providers, incurred in 2001 and 2002, that he said were his former wife's.  He said his wife incurred those debts after their separation, and he would not pay 
them because they were not his.<A HREF="03-01579.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> He said his seven-month period of unemployment (December 2001 to July 2002) severely affected his finances.  He said 
since he was no longer unemployed and had acquired a job, he intended to pay all his debts.  In his answer to the SOR, dated October 30, 2003, Applicant again 
expressed his intent to satisfy his financial delinquencies.  He said he would arrange a repayment plan through a credit counselor a plan to pay the debts.  He 
presented no credible evidence to show that he settled or paid his delinquent accounts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed and certified a security clearance application (SF-86) on July 31, 2002.  Applicant answered "no" to Questions 38 and 39.  Question 38 on 
the SF-86 reads as follows: "Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 Days.  In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?"  Question 
39 on the SF-86 reads as follows: "Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 Days.  Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?"  Applicant did not 
offer a credible explanation for answering "no" to both questions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The debts listed in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c., 1.e., 1.g., and 1.h. of the SOR were currently over 90 days delinquent at the time Applicant completed and certified 
his SF-86.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government's concern under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, is that individuals who are financially overextended and unable or unwilling to pay 
their just debts may try to generate funds by engaging in illegal acts.  Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations, and this financial history 
suggests an inability or unwillingness to satisfy his debts, conditions which raise security concerns under subparagraphs E2.A6.1.2.1. and E2.A6.1.2.3. of 
Guideline F.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  DOHA's Appeal Board has concluded that "[a] person who is unwilling to fulfill his legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of 
good judgment and reliability required of persons granted access to classified information."  ISCR Case No. 98-0810 at 4 (App. Bd. June 8, 2000).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had ten unpaid delinquent debts  (&para;&para; 1.a. through 1.j.) and insufficient resources to satisfy the ten debts (&para; 1.k.).  An 
applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his response  to the SOR, Applicant admitted owing the ten debts and stated he intended to pay them at some future and unspecified time.  The Government 
has established, through the FORM and Applicant's admissions, a <EM>prima facie</EM> case that Applicant is financially overextended.  Applicant provided no 
persuasive evidence to rebut the financial concerns specified in the SOR and identified as disqualifying conditions under &para;&para; E2.A6.1.2.1. and E2.A6.1.2.3. of 
Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We turn to a review of the several conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant's financial delinquencies.  Applicant's acknowledged 
delinquencies involve long-standing debts which continue to be unsatisfied to this day.  Thus, neither mitigating condition E2.A.6.1.3.1. nor mitigating 
condition E2.A6.1.3.2. applies.  Applicant asserts his seven-month period of unemployment, from December 2001 to early July 2002, caused him to be 
delinquent in paying his debts.  The record shows, however, that Applicant's financial difficulties go back as far as 1995 and that some delinquencies relate to 
debts incurred well after he obtained his present job.  The record shows Applicant's delinquencies were not the result of circumstances beyond his control, and 
thus, mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.3. does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant stated he intended to seek counseling for his financial problems, but he submitted no persuasive evidence that he had developed and implemented a 
practical plan for resolving his indebtedness.  Thus, neither mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.4. nor E2.A6.1.3.6. applies to the facts of Applicant's case.  
Accordingly, the allegations in the SOR of financial delinquencies (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.j.), and the allegation that Applicant lacks sufficient resources 
to pay his debts (subparagraph 1.k.) are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E  - Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant deliberately falsified his answers on his SF 86 to questions 38 and 39 (&para; 2.a.). Conduct involving questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that an applicant may not 
properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in SOR subparagraphs 2.a., the Government has established its case.  Applicant's assertions that he did not 
intend to falsify his responses to Questions 38 and 39 are not credible in light of his awareness of his financial problems over a period of several years, and his 
creditors' many attempts to put him on notice of delinquent debts.  Additionally, Applicant's statement that he failed to list his financial delinquencies because 
he misunderstood the questions lacks credibility.  He did not  answer Questions 38 and 39 completely, truthfully, and correctly, and this raises a security 
concern under &para; E2.A5.1.2.2 of Guideline E.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's concealment of information he considered embarrassing or negative could make</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">him vulnerable to coercion or blackmail.  E2.A5.1.2.4.  His conduct raises additional concerns under &para; E2.A5.1.2.5. because it suggests a pattern of dishonesty 
or rule violation.  Applicant's reticence to reveal the truth about his conduct suggests that, under some circumstances, he may put his interests before those of 
the Government.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating condition E2.A5.1.3.1. does not apply to the facts of this case.  The information withheld by Applicant is pertinent to a determination of his 
judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. Two other mitigating conditions under Guideline E might be applicable to the instant case.  The security concern 
raised by Applicant's disqualifying conduct could be mitigated if the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and if the Applicant subsequently 
provided the correct information voluntarily.  &para; E2.A5.1.3.2.  While Applicant supplied some of the correct information about his financial delinquencies when 
questioned by a special agent of the Defense Security Service in November 2002, his falsifications were not isolated incidents and they are recent.  Mitigating 
condition E2.A5.1.3.3. is also inapplicable, since Applicant did not make prompt good faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the 
facts.  Accordingly, the allegations in subparagraph 2.a. of the SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
