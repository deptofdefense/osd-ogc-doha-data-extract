<P>Applicant was born in Russia, emigrated to the United States in 1994, and became a U.S. citizen in 2002.  Applicant's mother and cousin are citizens and 
residents of Russia.  Applicant is close to her mother and maintains regular contact.  Her mother is awaiting her visa to immigrate to this country.  Applicant's 
mother-in-law is a citizen of Russia, but lives permanently in the U.S. and is applying for U.S. citizenship.  Applicant's extensive bonds with the U.S. mitigate 
the security concerns arising from having relatives who are citizens or residents of Russia.  Applicant's eligibility for assignment to a sensitive position is 
granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On September 15, 2002, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to 
grant the application under Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program</EM>, (Jan. 1987), as amended and modified (the 
"Regulation"), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and 
modified (the "Directive").  On May 18, 2004, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.  The SOR alleges security 
concerns raised under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on July 10, 2004.  She elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on October 14, 2004.  With the concurrence of the parties, I conducted the hearing on November 16, 2004.  The government 
introduced five exhibits.  Applicant presented 15 exhibits and the testimony of two witnesses.  Additionally, Applicant testified on her own behalf.  DOHA 
received the transcript on December 9, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR and noted mitigating conditions.  Applicant's Answer to SOR, dated July 10, 2004, at 1, 9, 10.  Those 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional 
findings of fact:</P>

times a year to stay in touch and discuss family matters.  Tr. at 105.</P> 
<P>Russia is a federation, and came into existence after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.  Ex. 3 at 4.  The executive branch wields considerable power; 
the legislative and judicial branches are comparatively weak.  <EM>Id. </EM>at 5. <EM> </EM>The new government has made progress in recognizing international human rights, 
however its record on human rights remains uneven and has worsened in some areas in recent years.  <EM>Id. </EM>at 6.  The Russian constitution provides for freedom of 
religion, but some faiths continue to encounter prejudice and discrimination that has not been prosecuted effectively by governmental authorities.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 7.  </P>

launched numerous major terrorist attacks against government and civilian locations.  Ex. 5 at 1.  The attacks have not targeted Americans, although it is 
possible Americans may be random victims.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 1-2.  The State Department warns Americans against travel in Chechnya and neighboring regions.  <EM>Id.</EM>  </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently 
trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 
Executive Order 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM>, &sect; 3.1(b) (August 4, 1995), the President provided that eligibility for access to classified information 
shall be granted only to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of 
character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and 
willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in DoD 5200.2-R.  "The standard that must be met 
for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning 
the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security."  DoD 5200.2-R, &para; C6.1.1.1.  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this 
case is: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Foreign Influence:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, or other persons to whom he or she may be bound 
by affection, influence, or obligation, are (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries 
are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  DoD 5200.2-R, Appendix 8.  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the 
available, reliable information about the person. <EM> Id.</EM>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. <EM>Id.</EM>  <BR> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in DoD Directive 5220.6 before any final unfavorable access determination may be 
made.  DoD 5200.2-R, &para; C8.2.1.  Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify 
the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  Directive, &para; E3.1.14.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to 
rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive, &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to 
classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive, &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President has established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government's evidence and Applicant's admissions constitute substantial evidence of a potentially disqualifying condition under the Foreign Influence 
Guideline of Appendix 8 of DoD 5200.2-R.  The Regulation provides that it may be a disqualifying condition if "an immediate family member, or a person to 
whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country<EM>.</EM>"  The Regulation does not define the 
phrase "immediate family member," but the Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.3.1, defines the phrase to include a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and 
sisters.  Applicant's mother is a citizen and resident of Russia.  Additionally, Applicant has close ties of affection or obligation to her mother-in-law, who is a 
citizen of Russia residing in the U.S., and her cousin, who is a citizen and resident of Russia.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These circumstances "could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information."  DoD 5200.2-R, Appendix 
8, Foreign Influence.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mere possession of family ties with persons in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, automatically disqualifying . . . [it] does raise a prima facie security 
concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for the applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 at **33-34 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concerns raised by Applicant's relatives who are citizens or residents of Russia may be mitigated where it is determined that "the immediate family 
member(s) . . . would not constitute an unacceptable security risk."  DoD 5200.2-R, Appendix 8, Foreign Influence.  The Regulation does not provide a 
definition or explanation for the phrase, "unacceptable security risk."  However, in similar circumstances, &para; E2.A2.1.3.1. of the Directive provides that it may 
be mitigating where the relatives in question "are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the 
individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United States."  <STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother, mother-in-law, and cousin are not "agents of a foreign power."  <EM>See</EM> 50 U.S.C.A. &sect; 1801(b).  They are not employees of the Russian 
government, or otherwise associated with a "foreign power."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In assessing whether relatives are vulnerable to exploitation, it is helpful to consider several factors, including the character of the government of the relevant 
foreign country.  Russia was once an authoritarian state controlled by the communist party.  Ex. 3 at 4.  Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, 
Russia has reformed its government toward democratic ideals.  Russia is on good relations with the United States, and is cooperating in numerous significant 
areas.  Russia's constitution protects human rights, but its record of enforcing these rights is uneven.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 6.  Additionally, terrorist groups have launched 
several attacks in Russia.  Thus, a possibility exists that a foreign power in Russia would attempt to exploit or pressure its residents to act adversely to the 
interests of the United States.<STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is important to consider also the vulnerability to duress of Applicant's relatives.  Applicant's mother is 70 years old and retired.  She relies on her 
governmental stipend for support.  Under these circumstances, Applicant's mother is vulnerable to governmental pressure or duress.  I also note that her petition 
to immigrate to the U.S. was approved and she is awaiting her visa.  Once she is physically located in the U.S., her susceptibility to adverse influence from a 
foreign power will be greatly diminished.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's cousin is a citizen and resident of Russia.  She does not work for the government or rely upon a government pension.  Under the circumstances, she 
is potentially vulnerable to coercion or pressure from the Russian government, although there is no evidence this has ever occurred.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother-in-law is a citizen of Russia, but resides permanently in the U.S.  She was a religious refugee from Russia, and has never returned to that 
country.  Since she resides in the U.S., the possibility that a foreign power in Russia could exert improper influence against her is extremely limited.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Another significant factor is Applicant's vulnerability to pressure or duress applied indirectly through her ties with her relatives.  Applicant has not lived with 
her mother since she was 17 years old, but she still has strong familial and emotional ties to her mother.  She has close familial ties to her mother-in-law as 
well.  Although Applicant does not have frequent or regular contact with her cousin, I find some ties of familial obligation exist.  Nevertheless, Applicant has 
substantially greater ties to the United States.  She left Russia because of difficult living conditions and the religious persecution of her husband's family.  She 
has lived here since 1994, and has been a citizen since 2002.  Her husband and two children are citizens of the U.S., and all her family's financial interests are 
here.  She has worked for her present employer for several years.  I conclude Applicant is unlikely to allow herself to be adversely influenced by a foreign 
power in such a way that would force her to chose between loyalty to the relative n question and the United States. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I balanced all the factual circumstances and applied them to the adjudicative criteria established in the Regulation in light of the whole person concept.  I 
considered the likelihood that the government of the Russia or a foreign power in that country would exploit Applicant's relatives, their vulnerability to 
pressure, coercion, or duress, and Applicant's ties of affection or obligation to her relatives and to the United States.  I conclude the mitigating condition set out 
in the Regulation applies.<EM>  </EM>Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her family ties to relatives who are citizens or residents of Russia.</SPAN></P>
