<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>On April 28, 1998, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued the attached Statement of Reasons
(SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant
and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 26, 1998, in which he elected to have the case determined on a
written record in lieu of a hearing.   Department Counsel submitted  the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM)
to the Applicant on July 16, 1998.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or
mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on July 29, 1998, and he submitted no response.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The case was transferred to the undersigned for resolution on October 1, 1998. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></STRONG><U></U></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Applicant is 48 years old, unmarried and is employed by a defense contractor as a Aircraft Mechanic.  He is applying
for a Secret-level security clearance in connection with his employment.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the
attached Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and criterion in the
SOR:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><U>Paragraph 1 (Criterion J - Criminal Conduct)</U>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he has engaged in a history of criminal conduct, including Assault with a Deadly Weapon with Intent to Commit
Murder, Theft of Personal Property, Attempted Murder, Inflicting Corporal Injury and Resisting or Obstructing an Officer
in Discharge of Duties and Battery Against a Peace Officer.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Applicant denies that his history of criminal conduct shows a pattern.  He admits a history of criminal conduct as set
forth in subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c.  He denies subparagraphs  1.d., and 1.e.  The record evidence indicates that
beginning in 1969, and continuing until as recently as May 1997, the Applicant has engaged in criminal conduct resulting
in numerous arrests.  (See, Government Exhibits 1 through 19).  </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Applicant was first arrested in August 1969, and charged with Assault with a Deadly Weapon with Intent to Commit
Murder, a felony in the state in which it occurred.  The Applicant and his friend went to a liquor store to buy some beer,
where they met other males who were strangers to him.  Together they drank beer and drove around in a car.  The
Applicant was then invited to go along with the males to kill someone.  The Applicant claims that he was forced at gun
point to participate in the crime.  In fear for his own life, he agreed to help them.  </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Once at the victim's residence, they told the victim that someone wanted to see him down at the corner.  Suspecting that
something was up, the victim took a .22 caliber single shot rifle with him.  When the victim arrived at the corner, one of
the males fired at the victim with a pistol, striking him in the elbow and abdomen.  The police report indicates that the
Applicant did not witness the shooting as he had proceeded back to the waiting vehicle, which was parked a short distance
away.  The Applicant states that his drinking beer caused him to get into the situation.  The Applicant pled guilty to an
amended charge of Assault with Force with Intent to do Great Bodily Injury.  He was placed on three years probation, and
was fined $300.00 plus penalty assessment.  (See, Government Exhibits 5 and 10).</P>

<P> </P>

<P>The Applicant was arrested in January 1980, and charged with Theft of Personal Property.  The Applicant went into a
department store to buy a lock for his tool box, put a wrench in his pocket and walked out of the store with it.  He was
stopped by store security and arrested.  He pled guilty, and was sentenced to 48 hours in jail, and fined $50.00 plus a
penalty assessment.       </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Applicant was arrested in October 1983, and charged with Obstructs/Resists Public Officer.  (See, Government
Exhibit 14).</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Applicant was arrested in September 1994, and charged with Attempted Murder, a felony in the state in which it
occurred.  The police report of the incident states that the Applicant and his girlfriend were in the Applicant's truck where
they had been drinking and arguing.  The  Applicant's girlfriend pulled a .22 caliber pistol out of her purse and pointed it
at the Applicant.  As the Applicant grabbed the gun away from his girlfriend, it went off, shooting her in the neck.  The
Applicant drove her to the fire station where she was transported by paramedics to the hospital.  She later died.  The
charges were dismissed as it was determined to either be an accident or self-defense.  (See, Government Exhibit 12).</P>

<P>  </P>

<P>The Applicant was arrested in May 1997, and charged with Inflicting Corporal Injury, Resisting or Obstructing an Officer
in Discharge of Duties, and Battery Against a Peace Officer.  The Applicant had been drinking alcohol when a domestic
dispute occurred between him and his girlfriend at their trailer.  The police were summoned.  The police report reveals
that the Applicant hit his girlfriend several times with his fist on the back of her head.  The Applicant denies ever hitting
her.  The Applicant claims that the police entered his trailer, and hit him in the back of his head which caused him to go
unconscious.  He was later transported to the hospital for stitches.  The charges were dismissed.  A probation revocation
hearing was initiated.  (Reference allegation 1.e., and See, Government Exhibit 17).  </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><U></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><U>Paragraph 2 (Criterion G - Alcohol Consumption)</U>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he abuses intoxicants.</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> The Applicant denies subparagraphs 2.a., through 2.f.  The record evidence reveals, to the contrary, that at the time of the
arrests of August 3, 1969, September 4, 1994, January 9, 1996, January 22, 1996, and May 22, 1997, he was under the
influence of alcohol.  The Applicant began drinking in 1969 and drank alcohol habitually to excess until at least May
1997.  He states that until May 1997, he consumed about a twelve pack of beer on a weekly basis.  In May 1997, he quit
drinking altogether and has no intentions of ever drinking again as he wants to get his life turned around.  (See,
Applicant's Answer to SOR).  </FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Applicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol on January 9, 1996, and again on January 22,
1996.  In both instances, he pled either nolo contendere, or guilty to an amended charge of Reckless Driving.  For each
offense, he was ordered to complete 40 hours of community service, and fined $25.00.      </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><U>Paragraph 3 (Criterion E - Personal Conduct)</U>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because his conduct involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness and unreliability, or an unwillingness to comply
with rules and regulations.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Applicant admits subparagraph 3.a., and 3.b., and denies subparagraph 3.c.  The record evidence indicates that the
Applicant was arrested in October 1970, and was charged with Reckless Driving, and an outstanding bench warrant for
Disturbing the Peace.  He was found guilty of disturbing the peace and was sentenced to serve ten days in jail or a fine of
$65.00.  (See, Government Exhibit 4).</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Applicant was cited in July 1996, for Driving with a Suspended License, and Tail Light needed to illuminate License
Plate.  He pled guilty to an amended charge of Driving with a Suspended License on the highway.  The Applicant was
placed on one year probation and fined $135.00.  In July 1997, the Applicant's probation was revoked due to the fact that
he was arrested again as set forth in allegation 1.e.  His probation was subsequently reinstated and extended until October
1999.  He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, and was released after one day served.     </P>

<P><STRONG><U>POLICIES</U></STRONG><U></U></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of  the
1992 Directive sets forth policy factors and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case
according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in
any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on  own common sense.  Because each security
clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm
of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most
applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><U>Criterion J (Criminal Conduct)</U></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><U>Conditions that could raise a security concern</U>:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>(1)  any criminal conduct regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>(2)  a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><U>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</U>:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><U>Criterion G (Alcohol Consumption)</U></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><U>Conditions that could raise a security concern</U>:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>(1)  alcohol related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>(4) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgement.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>(5) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations</P>

<P>(6) association with persons involved in criminal activity.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><U></U><U>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns:</U></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>None.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at page 2-1,  "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's
conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general factors:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P>

<P> </P>

<P>c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>e.  The voluntariness of participation</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>g.  The motivation for the conduct </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence."</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The eligibility criteria established in the DOD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are
reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly
consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted
upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately
concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in criminal conduct,
alcohol abuse and personal conduct which demonstrates poor judgment, untrustworthiness or unreliability.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an
affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is
predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful
weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The
Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence
of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in
nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this
order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty
of the Applicant concerned."</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG><U></U></STRONG><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG><U></U></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted
upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is
therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved
in criminal and dishonest conduct, which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational
connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been
established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation
which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of
persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by evidence that the Applicant has engaged in criminal
conduct (Criterion J), alcohol abuse (Criterion G), and poor personal conduct (Criterion E).  This evidence indicates poor
judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Where an Applicant engages in criminal conduct, or poor personal conduct, it can be presumed that he or she will not take
a serious attitude toward the important matter of protecting classified information.  Criminal Conduct reflects questionable
judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified
information.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by
all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.  If an Applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the
law in his private affairs, then there exists the possibility that he or she may demonstrate the same attitude towards
security rules and regulations.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>This Applicant has failed to introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to
overcome the Government's case against him. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The record evidence establishes that the Applicant has engaged in a pattern and history of criminal conduct starting about
29 years ago, that has continued until as recently as May of last year.  The Applicant remains on probation until October
1999.  His criminal offenses are numerous, serious, recent, and show immaturity and extreme poor judgment. 
Furthermore, as the police reports and the Applicant's version of the criminal conduct alleged in each incident are so
contradictory, I do not find the Applicant to be candid, credible or forthright concerning his involvement. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>  With respect to the Applicant's history of alcohol abuse, at least five of his arrests occurred when he was under the
influence of alcohol.  His two arrests for Driving Under the Influence of alcohol occurred about thirty-four months ago, in
January 1996.  His most recent alcohol related arrest occurred in May of last year.  Although he states that as of May
1997, he has stopped drinking, given the serious extent of his past abusive drinking pattern, which occurred repeatedly
over a period of 29 years, sufficient time in sobriety has not passed to ensure that he will not return to his old ways. 
Accordingly, Criterion G (Alcohol Abuse), is found against the Applicant.  </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The Applicant has also failed to respond to the File of Relevant Material, which leaves the record silent on the issue of
rehabilitation.  The Applicant does not shows remorse or sensitivity to his past wrong behavior.  It is not clear that the
Applicant has gained the necessary insight into the seriousness of his criminal conduct or personal conduct, or whether he
is prepared to act responsibly in the future.  I cannot say that he is unlikely to repeat his irresponsible conduct.  I find that
the Applicant's criminal conduct and personal conduct was not isolated, was recent, and could possibly recur in the future. 
Accordingly, Criterion J, (Criminal Conduct), and Criterion E, (Personal Conduct) are found against the Applicant.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a
security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary
allegations expressed in Paragraph 1, 2, and 3 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.</P>
