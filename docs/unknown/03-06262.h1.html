<P>Applicant is a U.S. citizen working for a defense contractor in Southern California.  He has a financial interest in the residential property where he lives in 
Tijuana, Mexico.  His wife, children, mother, younger sister, mother-in-law, and father-in-law are citizens and residents of Mexico.  He used his aunt's 
California address to obtain a California vehicle registration, driver's license, and a U.S. Alien Registration card for his wife.  He pays U.S. and California

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>On April 6, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to not grant a 
security clearance to Applicant.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive). <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference), B (Foreign Influence), and E (Personal 
Conduct) of the Directive.  Under Guideline C, it alleges that Applicant is a citizen of the U.S. but has resided in Mexico since the age of five.  Under Guideline 
B, it alleges that Applicant's spouse, son, daughter, mother, younger sister, mother-in-law, and father-in-law are citizens and residents of Mexico, that his older 
sister is a U.S. citizen residing in Mexico, and that Applicant owns a mobile home and residential property in Mexico.  Under Guideline E, it alleges that 
Applicant improperly used his aunt's California address obtain a driver's license, register his automobile, and obtain a U.S. Alien Registration Card for his 
wife.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on May 7, 2004.  He denied the general security concerns under each guideline.  He admitted  the specific allegations 
under Guidelines C and E and offered explanations.  He admitted the specific allegations under Guideline B, except the allegations that his older sister resides 
in Mexico and that he owns property in Mexico.  He offered explanations and requested a hearing.  </SPAN>The case was assigned to me on August 20, 2004.  On 
September 1, 2004, DOHA issued a notice of hearing setting the case for October 7, 2004.  Applicant appeared as scheduled.  DOHA received the transcript 
(Tr.) on October 26, 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 35-year-old simulator technician for a defense contractor.  His co-workers regard him as honest, loyal to the U.S., and dedicated to his family.  
He has held a security clearance since 1990.  He works in Southern California and lives in Tijuana, Mexico.  He commutes across the border daily.  He has 
worked for several defense contractors at the same location for about 15 years.  His clearance has never been suspended or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is citizen of the U.S., born in the U.S. of Mexican parents.  His parents lived in the U.S. for about nine years.  When Applicant was five years old, his 
parents returned to Mexico because they could not afford to buy a home in the U.S.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is married to a citizen and resident of Mexico.  He has two children, a 12-year-old son and a 7-year-old daughter.  His children are citizens and 
residents of Mexico.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant paid for a plot of land that he and his father purchased in 1990.  Applicant and his father agreed that title to the property would be in his father's 
name, since Applicant is not a Mexican citizen.  After his father died, title passed to his mother, who in turn transferred it to Applicant's wife.  Applicant 
purchased a double-wide mobile home, placed it on the property, and renovated it.  He, his wife, and their children now live in it.  His wife is not employed 
outside the home.  His children attend a private school in Mexico. Applicant lives in Mexico because the housing is more affordable and his neighborhood is 
safe, peaceful, and not exposed to gang violence and drugs.  Some of his co-workers who live in the U.S. commute long distances, up to 150 miles per daily 
round trip, to find affordable housing.</P> 
 
<P>About two years ago, Applicant tried to qualify for a loan to purchase a home in the U.S.  He could not qualify because of his debts.  His employment income 
has risen since then, and he hopes to qualify for a home loan soon.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's mother, two children, wife, mother-in-law, father-in-law, and his younger sister are citizens and residents of Mexico.  He intends to obtain U.S. 
citizenship for his son so that he will not be required to serve in the Mexican military.  His younger sister has a green card and works in the U.S.  His brother 
and older sister are citizens and residents of the U.S.  None of his relatives and in-laws work for the Mexican government or military.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant obtained a California driver's license, registered and insured his automobile in California, payed California and U.S. income taxes, and performed 
jury duty in California.  In each transaction, he used his aunt's California address and represented it as his own.  His aunt gave him permission to use her 
address.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant pays only real property taxes in Mexico.  He receives no medical benefits or retirement benefits from Mexico.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant obtained a U.S. Alien Registration Card (green card) for his wife, representing  she would reside at his aunt's address.  He obtained the green card on 
the advice of an American immigration lawyer to make it easier for her to visit the U.S. for entertainment and shopping.  Her green card expires in December 
2004.</P> 
 
<P>At the hearing Applicant admitted he knew he was making a false statement when he represented that his wife would live in the U.S.  He intends to renew the 
green card using the false address.  (Tr. 58-61) He asserted he did not know that using a false address was a crime. (Tr. 66-67)</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  
Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person 
concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus 
or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec 19, 2002); </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Guideline C (Foreign Preference)</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an applicant acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S., he may be prone to provide information or make decisions 
that are harmful to the interests of the U.S.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.1.</SPAN>  None of the enumerated disqualifying conditions under Guideline C are established by the 
evidence.  The evidence shows that Applicant resides in Mexico because of economic preference, not political preference.  His political ties are to the U.S.  He 
is a U.S. citizen, votes in the U.S., pays U.S. and California taxes, served on a jury in California, has a California driver's license and vehicle registration, and 
has attempted qualify for a loan to buy a house in California.  I conclude that the allegation of foreign preference is rebutted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not 
citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may arise when "[a]n immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has 
close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.  Applicant's admissions establish DC 1 
for the SOR &para;&para; 2.a. (wife), 2.b. (son), 2.c. (daughter), 2.d. (mother and younger sister), and 2.f. (mother-in-law and father-in-law).  DC 1 is not established for 
the SOR &para; 1.e. (older sister), because the uncontroverted evidence shows she is a citizen and resident of the U.S. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In cases where an Applicant has immediate family members who are citizens or residents of a foreign country or who are connected with a foreign government, 
a mitigating condition (MC 1) may apply if "the immediate family members (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters) . . . are not agents of a 
foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved 
and the United States."  Directive &para; E2A2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of MC 1("agents of a foreign power <STRONG>or</STRONG> in a position to be exploited"), it requires proof "that an applicant's 
family members, cohabitant, or associates in question are (a) not agents of a foreign power, <STRONG>and</STRONG> (b) not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way 
that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004); <EM>see</EM> 50 
U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b) (defining "agent of a foreign power").  Since the Government has produced substantial evidence to establish DC 1, the burden has shifted to 
Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The totality of an applicant's family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  </SPAN>ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. 
Sep. 22, 2003).  Applicant's family ties to Mexico and the possible effect they may have on Applicant's conduct are relevant considerations under Guideline B 
(Foreign Influence).  ISCR Case No. 01-02452 at 8 (App. Bd. Nov. 21, 2002).<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  His ties to his in-laws are also relevant because "there is a rebuttable 
presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse."   ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 
DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Guideline B is not limited to countries that are hostile to the United States.  "The United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding 
classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or 
country has interests inimical to those of the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  Distinctions between friendly and 
unfriendly governments must be made with caution.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, even friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or 
national security. Finally, we know that even friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and 
technical fields.</SPAN>  <EM>See</EM> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation's government, 
its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant's family members are vulnerable to 
government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family 
member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of Applicant's family members or in-laws are agents of a foreign power.  They are not employed by or connected with the Mexican government.  Their 
modest social and economic statuses make them unlikely targets of exploitation.  They are not engaged in businesses that engage in economic espionage.  They 
all live in a border town whose economic and cultural interests are closely linked to the U.S.  Although violent crime and drug trafficking are problems in many 
areas of Mexico, Applicant's community is peaceful and safe.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mexico's economy is strongly linked to the U.S.<A HREF="03-06262.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Although Mexico has experienced human rights abuses, it is a democracy with strong economic and cultural 
ties to the U.S.  Its relations with the U.S. are cooperative and generally friendly.  Its military forces focus on national defense, narcotics control, and civic 
action assignments such as road building, search and rescue, and disaster relief.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-06262.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  I conclude MC 1 is established, and the security concern based on 
Applicant's ties to his family and in-laws in Mexico is mitigated.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A disqualifying condition (DC 8) may arise if an applicant has "a substantial financial interest" in a foreign country.  Directive &para; E2A2.2.1.2.8. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Applicant's 
admission that he has a financial interest in real estate and a mobile home in Mexico that are worth about $25,000.00 establishes DC 8</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">When an applicant has a "substantial financial interest" in a foreign country, that disqualifying condition can be mitigated by showing that the financial interests 
are "minimal" and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.5.  Applicant's income is limited, and his ability to 
obtain a loan has been hampered in the past by the extent of his debts.  He would be homeless and without resources to obtain another home if he lost his 
property.  I conclude Applicant's financial interest in Mexico is not "minimal" in light of  his overall financial condition.  Accordingly, I conclude the security 
concerns based on Applicant's financial interests in Mexico are not mitigated.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations 
could indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  A "pattern of dishonesty or rule violations" can 
raise a security concern and be disqualifying (DC 5).  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.5.  The evidence shows that Applicant registered his motor vehicle in California 
and obtained a California driver's license by falsely representing that he resided in California.  His conduct was dishonest, demonstrated unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations, and may have violated the California Vehicle Code, &sect;&sect; 4150 and 12800 (2004).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant also obtained a green card for his wife by falsely representing that she resided in California.  His fraudulent conduct may have made his wife 
ineligible for lawful admission to the U.S.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182 (alien who has fraudulently procured visa or admission to the U.S. may not be admitted).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's daily border crossings with a U.S. passport undoubtedly would be more difficult, if not impossible, if he registered his vehicle in Mexico and had a 
exican driver's license.  Having chosen to live in Mexico, however, he must live with the consequences.  Personal convenience and economic advantage do 
not justify or mitigate fraudulent conduct.  Furthermore, Applicant's fraudulent conduct in obtaining a green card for his wife was motivated by personal 
convenience and enjoyment rather than economic necessity or a patriotic desire to be recognized and treated as a U.S. citizen.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I find the allegations in SOR &para;&para; 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c. are established.  I conclude DC 5 is established, and Applicant's fraudulent conduct is not mitigated.</SPAN></P>
