<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns were raised regarding a 32-year old Vietnam-born naturalized U.S. citizen Applicant--who managed to escape from the Communist regime 
in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRVN) on his 10<SUP>th</SUP> attempt in 1980--but who has several family members who remain either citizens or residents of

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 17, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn written statement, dated December 5, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing.  The case was 
assigned to, and received by, me on February 20, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued that same day, with a corrected notice issued on February 23, 2004, and 
the hearing was held before me via video-teleconference on March 12, 2004.  During the course of the hearing, one joint exhibit (a stipulation), one government 
exhibit, and the testimony of three Applicant witnesses (including the Applicant), were received.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 22, 2004.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the proceeding, under Rule 201(b)(2), Federal Rules of Evidence, Department Counsel requested that official notice be taken of certain adjudicative 
facts as set forth in a document furnished for consideration.  There being no objection interposed by Applicant, I took official notice of the U.S. Department of 
State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, <EM>Consular Information Sheet: Vietnam</EM>, dated January 13, 2004, consisting of 10 pages.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted all of the factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence under Guideline B (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f.).  Those admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance the level of which was not divulged.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in 1971 in what was then the Republic of Vietnam (RVN).<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  He resided with his parents and younger brother.  Upon the collapse of RVN 
in 1975, Applicant's uncle (his mother's brother), a member of the defeated RVN military, escaped and fled to the U.S.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Wishing to escape the tyranny of the Communist regime, Applicant's family split into two separate units with his father and brother in one unit and he and his 
mother in another so they would all not be captured together.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  They made nine attempts to escape to freedom<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> by small boat, but were caught by the 
authorities and returned home on three of those occasions.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  On six other attempts they evaded capture but missed the larger boat that would have taken them 
to freedom.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Applicant and his mother were finally successful, and in 1980, when he was 9-years-old, they made their way to Singapore from where they 
contacted an uncle in the U.S. who had previously escaped in 1975.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  That uncle sponsored them for immigration into the U.S.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his uncle petitioned for his father and brother to come to the U.S., and in 1991, under their sponsorship, his father and brother were permitted to 
immigrate to the U.S. as well.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Applicant's mother became a naturalized U.S. citizen in May 1993,<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and Applicant was naturalized in August 1993.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  
Applicant's father was also naturalized,<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> but the date of that action has not been specified.  He passed away in 1999.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  Applicant's brother eventually 
obtained his permanent residency, but he is not yet a naturalized U.S. citizen.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father also had three daughters from a previous marriage.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  They were initially left behind in SRVN when the family emigrated.  The oldest half-sister (about 42-years-old)<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> is a housewife, a SRVN citizen,<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> married to a U.S. citizen residing in the U.S,<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> and is currently in the process of immigrating to 
the U.S. through the sponsorship of her husband.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  Before her marriage, Applicant generally sent her about $200.00 every few months<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> or a maximum of 
about $500.00 per year.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  His second half-sister (about 40-41-years-old)<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> is a single factory worker who is a citizen of SRVN<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> and a permanent resident of 
the U.S.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  The youngest half-sister (about 36-years-old)<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> is a housewife residing in the U.S.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When he arrived in the U.S., Applicant attended local schools<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> and completed two years of college and university.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  When his employer stopped funding his 
education Applicant was unable to continue his education.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  He intends to continue his education on his own.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For a variety of reasons, Applicant returned to SRVN on five occasions since escaping the country.  In 1995, he returned to visit with his ill grandmother, 
staying for a period less than one month with his half-sister.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  He returned in January 1997, when his grandmother passed away and remained there again for 
less than one month.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  It was during that trip that he met the woman who eventually became his wife.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A>  In June 1997, he returned to SRVN to visit with her 
for 10 days and discussed a potential engagement.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>  In September or October 1997 she came to the U.S. and they were married.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A>  They returned to SRVN in 
early 2001, along with their respective relatives to have a family wedding banquet, and remained there for less than one month.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A>  In November 2001, after 
getting laid off from his job, and feeling depressed, he returned to SRVN to see his sick half-sister.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A>  He has no further plans to return to SRVN for a long 
time.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A>  At no time during any of his visits to SRVN was Applicant ever approached or questioned by anyone as to what he considered to be inappropriate 
inquiries.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife, a French citizen, was born in RVN to French citizens.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A>  Her grandmother was half French and half Vietnamese.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A>  Her grandfather was a 
wealthy businessman in RVN before the collapse of the government to the Communists in 1975, when he lost everything.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A>  Her father (born in 1930)<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> was a 
property manager in SRVN unaffiliated with the governments of France or SRVN.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A>  Her mother (born in 1936)<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A> worked in a factory.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A>  In 1981, after 
completing the appropriate paperwork, most of her family, consisting of her parents, two sisters, as well as herself, were permitted to leave SRVN and flew to 
France by plane.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A>  One sister, a housewife, remained in SRVN with her family.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A> Applicant's wife has two uncles, both of whom had served with the RVN 
Army (ARVN), and who were sent to re-indoctrination and re-education camps by the Communist regime of the victorious SRVN.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_49_"><SUP> (49)</SUP></A>  One uncle (an enlisted 
man) remained for two years, and the other (an officer) remained for 10 years, before they were released.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_50_"><SUP> (50)</SUP></A>  The enlisted uncle has remained in SRVN as a 
farmer,<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_51_"><SUP> (51)</SUP></A> but the officer uncle was sponsored by a U.S. government program for immigration to the U.S.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_52_"><SUP> (52)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father-in-law and mother-in-law both retired in France and in 1997-98, seeking warmer weather, moved back to SRVN where they now reside 
supported by French pensions.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_53_"><SUP> (53)</SUP></A>  His mother-in-law visits him in the U.S. every two years and remains three to six months per visit.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_54_"><SUP> (54)</SUP></A>  One sister is still in 
SRVN and the other two reside in France.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant renounced his Vietnamese citizenship when he became a naturalized citizen of the United States and pledged his loyalty to protect and defend the 
interests of the U.S.  Applicant is not a dual citizen and considers himself to be a citizen of only the U.S.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_55_"><SUP> (55)</SUP></A>  The government has offered no evidence to rebut 
Applicant's contention, and I accept it as fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No member of Applicant's immediate family is an employee of any SRVN governmental agency or department or affiliated with any intelligence organization 
or with the Communist Party.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_56_"><SUP> (56)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife was granted permanent U.S. residency and is in the process of applying for U.S. citizenship.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_57_"><SUP> (57)</SUP></A>  Their son was born in the U.S. about one year 
ago.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_58_"><SUP> (58)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been employed by the same government contractor since February 2002.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_59_"><SUP> (59)</SUP></A> He was initially hired as a security officer,<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_60_"><SUP> (60)</SUP></A> but was recently 
promoted to logistics specialist.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_61_"><SUP> (61)</SUP></A>  His supervisor supports his application and has characterized him as a trustworthy and dedicated individual whose work has 
been outstanding.<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_62_"><SUP> (62)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government of RVN collapsed in 1975, coinciding with the establishment of the Communist SRVN.  Full diplomatic relations were established between 
the U.S. and SRVN in 1995, and, in 2001, a bilateral trade agreement between the two countries finally commenced.  Under that agreement, <EM>temporary</EM>--later 
modified to <EM>conditional</EM>--normal trade relations (formerly known as most-favored nation status) were extended by the U.S.  SRVN has also given the U.S. 
modest support in the war against terrorism.  While SRVN has a Communist totalitarian government which seemingly encourages technology transfers from the 
Vietnamese expatriate intellectuals abroad, the Department Counsel has offered no evidence to indicate SRVN conducts intelligence operations or economic 
espionage against the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E.2.2., Enclosure 2, 
of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>GUIDELINE B - FOREIGN INFLUENCE:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other 
persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  
These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of 
other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable 
to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in 
the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the protection of the national security is the paramount determinant, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_63_"><SUP> (63)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest."  For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded that both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences that are grounded on 
mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government 
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient 
to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
the applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that the government must 
be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to 
the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness testimony, demeanor, and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal 
precepts and factors, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline B.  Applicant has been portrayed as a person who is a potential security risk because members of his 
immediate family or persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence, or are either not citizens or residents of the United States or may be subject to duress.  
These situations raise the potential for vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure, and the exercise of foreign influence that could result in the 
compromise of classified information.  However, the mere possession of family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying 
under Guideline B:<A HREF="02-26920.h1.html#N_64_"><SUP> (64)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The language of [Guideline] B (Foreign Influence) in the Adjudicative Guidelines makes clear that the possession of such family ties <EM>may</EM> pose a security risk.  
Whether an applicant's family ties in a foreign country pose a security risk depends on a common sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of 
those family ties.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0419 (April 30, 1999) at p. 5.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this instance, the government's concerns are as follows: one half-sister and one sister-in-law are both citizens and residents of SRVN; a brother and two half-sisters are SRVN citizens residing in the U.S.; a wife is a French citizen residing in the U.S.; wife's parents are French citizens residing in SRVN; and two 
sisters-in-law are French citizens residing in France.  Those facts raise Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (<EM>an immediate family 
member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>).  However, 
considering the totality of the circumstances, much of the government's concerns seem unwarranted.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Obviously, there is significant concern because of the foreign governments involved.  SRVN is a Communist totalitarian country that is no longer involved in 
open military hostilities with the United States.  Its interests are not necessarily inimical to the United States, and SRVN currently is engaged in normal trade 
relations with the U.S.  It does, however, encourage technology transfers from Vietnamese expatriate intellectuals abroad.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Similarly, France</SPAN> is a somewhat <EM>friendly</EM> democracy and founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) with which the U.S. has had 
some disagreements but whose background and interests are not inimical to the United States.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">France has been known to conduct espionage operations against 
the U.S. especially in the economic or scientific or technical fields.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SRVN citizenship status of Applicant's brother--already a U.S. resident and in the process of becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen--and his oldest half-sister--married to a U.S. citizen and in the process of immigrating to the U.S.--minimizes any security concerns regarding them.  Likewise, the French 
citizenship status of Applicant's wife--already a U.S. resident and in the process of becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen--and two of his sisters-in-law--already 
U.S. residents--minimizes any security concerns regarding them.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With the number of individuals, about whom there might be security concerns, reduced, I turn to focus on the remaining family members.  Applicant's mother-in-law and father-in-law, both of whom are French citizens, immigrated to France in 1981, but upon their retirement in 1997-98, seeking a warmer climate, 
moved back to SRVN.  Their French citizenship and SRVN residency raise the issue of potential foreign influence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, also applicable, in this instance, is Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. (<EM>a determination that the immediate family 
member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position 
to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States</EM>).  After an 
examination of the evidence, and cognizant of Applicant's wife's grandfather's economic losses and her two uncles' experiences with re-indoctrination and re-education camps, all at the hands of the victorious Communist regime in SRVN, I determine that Applicant's family members and his wife's family members, 
including her parents who now reside in SRVN, do not constitute an unacceptable security risk.  The totality of circumstances, as well as common sense, lead 
me to resolve the risks are minimal.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The family is not Communist-to the contrary, they apparently hate the Communists-and with the rapidly improving relations between the two countries, there 
is no indication they are targets of any intelligence gathering.  Thus, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully 
mitigated and overcome the government's case with respect to Guideline B.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.f. of the SOR are concluded in favor of 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.  Clearance is granted.</SPAN></P>
