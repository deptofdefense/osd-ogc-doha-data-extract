<P>Applicant and her husband incurred over $47,547 in delinquent debt. Much of the debt became delinquent in 2003, as a result of Applicant's six month period of unemployment due to health issues 
and her husband's business failure. Applicant and her husband refinanced their mortgage and used the extra money to pay off much of the debt.  She is making regular payments towards her student 
loan account, which accounts for $26,997 of the delinquent debt. She and her husband currently have well paying jobs.  They are able to meet their financial obligations and have made a good faith 
effort towards resolving their delinquent debts. Applicant's eligibility for a assignment to a sensitive position is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On December 6, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an ADP I/II/III position. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the 
application under Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program, </EM>(Jan, 1987), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").<A HREF="06-07434.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On May 25, 2006, DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. 
The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under </SPAN>Guideline F, Financial Considerations.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement dated </SPAN>July 13, 2006<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN>The case was assigned to me on August 16, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A notice of hearing was issued on

the record without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - G which were admitted into the record without objection. </SPAN>The record was held open 
until October 19, 2006, to allow Applicant to submit further documents. A 32 page document was timely submitted and marked as AE H.  It was admitted without objection. DOHA received the

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her SOR response, Applicant admits to all the SOR allegations with the exception of SOR &para;&para; 1.g, 1.i, 1.o and 1.p.  Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough 
and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 42-year-old woman employed as a reconsideration specialist with a Department of Defense contractor who is seeking a position of public trust.  She has worked for her employer for 
two years.<A HREF="06-07434.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> She is married and has two sons, ages 19 and 16.<A HREF="06-07434.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  She has a Master's Degree in Nursing.<A HREF="06-07434.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant suffers from chronic back problems.  From March 24, 2003, to September 14, 2003, she was unemployed as a result of her medical condition.  In the fall 2003, her husband's  business 
failed.  Several of their debts became delinquent as a result.  Her son broke his arm this same year.  Insurance would not pay for his broken arm. Many of the debts are medical bills and delinquent 
student loan accounts. When Applicant  and her husband obtained new employment, their salary was much less than their previous jobs.<A HREF="06-07434.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 6, 2004, Applicant completed a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85-P).<A HREF="06-07434.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Her background investigation revealed 16 delinquent accounts with a total approximate balance of 
$47,547.<A HREF="06-07434.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  The accounts included a $94 medical account placed for collection (SOR &para; 1.a); a $114 medical account placed for collection (SOR &para; 1.b); a $154 department store account placed for 
collection (SOR &para; 1.c); a $177 medical account placed for collection (SOR &para; 1.d); a $2,717 account charged off as a bad debt in May 2004 (SOR &para; 1.e); a $6,258 medical account placed for 
collection in June 2004 (SOR &para; 1.f); a $1,737 department store account placed for collection in May 2004 (SOR &para; 1.g); a $2,944 account which was charged off as a bad debt in August 2004 (SOR 
&para; 1.h); a $78 medical account placed for collection in September 2004 (SOR &para; 1.i); a $3,683 medical account placed for collection in December 2004 (SOR &para; 1.j); four student loan accounts  placed 
for collection in March 2005, total balance $26,997 (SOR &para;&para; 1.k - 1.n); a $1,543 medical account, placed for collection in July 2005 (SOR &para; 1.o); and a $781 medical account placed for collection

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>), and FC DC 3 (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) 
</EM>apply to Applicant's case.  Applicant has had difficulty meeting her financial obligations since 2003.  She incurred 16 delinquent debts with an approximate total balance of $47,547, including 
$26,997 in delinquent student loans.</P> 
 
<P>I considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) and conclude FC MC 3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss 
of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation)</EM>) applies.  Applicant and her family encountered financial problems in 2003 due to the 
failure of her husband's business, and her six month period of unemployment as a result of health issues. Eight of the delinquent debts are medical accounts related to Applicant's chronic back 
condition and the medical expenses for her son's broken arm which was not covered by insurance.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC 4 (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control</EM>) applies.  Although not technically 
a formal financial counseling program, Applicant and her husband received a lot of financial advice from the loan officer who refinanced their mortgage.  They have paid off five of the delinquent 
accounts, an approximate total of $13,176. They are making payments on two of the accounts.  Applicant is close to bringing her student loan payments out of default. Her delinquent student loans 
account for a large part of the delinquent debt, approximately $26,997.  Once they are out of default, she is capable of continuing to make timely payments towards her student loans. She and her 
husband both have well paying jobs. Their financial problems appear to be under control.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC 6 (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) is also applicable. Applicant and her husband have actively worked on resolving their 
delinquent accounts.  I note that Applicant was unable to determine the identity of  the creditors in SOR &para;&para; 1.i, 1.o and 1.p.  She looked through her financial records and found no similar accounts.  
I find that she has made a good faith effort to resolve these accounts considering the vagueness of the allegations. Each of these accounts allege that she owes "an unknown creditor." She takes her 
job very seriously and is sincere about getting her family's financial situation in order.  She has made a good-faith effort to resolve her delinquent debts.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations security concern. Guideline F is decided for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the trustworthiness determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a 
person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in 
considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own 
merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the evidence and the "whole person" in evaluating Applicant's trustworthiness. Applicant has an exemplary work history. Her health issues, her six month period of 
unemployment and the failure of her husband's business contributed to her financial problems. She has taken positive steps to deal with her financial problems. Based on the evidence in the record, 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is granted.</P>
