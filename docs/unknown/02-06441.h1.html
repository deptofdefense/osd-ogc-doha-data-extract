<P>Applicant's marijuana use stopped five years ago.  No possibility of recurrence.  Government failed to prove that the Applicant falsified a questionnaire and a

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 6, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 28, 2003, and requested that the case be decided without a hearing.  </SPAN>The Government submitted its 
File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on July 8, 2003.  The Applicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit any documents in 
rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation.  The Applicant received the FORM on July 28, 2003, and submitted an additional statement dated August 25, 2003<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  
Department Counsel did not object to the Administrative Judge considering the statement.  The case was received by the undersigned on September 2, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 46, married and has a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks to obtain a DoD 
security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the exhibits.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug abuse)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal 
drugs.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant first began using marijuana as an enlisted man in the service in 1976.  He stopped using marijuana in 1978 because of growing maturity and the 
armed forces crackdown on drug use.  (Government Exhibit 5 at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant resumed his drug use in 1995.  At that time he had retired from the service and was attending college.  About once a month he would host parties 
at his home where marijuana was used.  Between 1995 and 1999 the Applicant used marijuana about 40 times.  He occasionally purchased marijuana during 
this period.  He stopped using marijuana in January 1999 and states that he has no intention of using it in the future.  (Government Exhibit 5 at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally 
falsified material aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 5, 2001, the Applicant was interviewed by a Special Agent from the Defense Security Service.  In a sworn statement he stated, "I have never 
used any illegal drug or controlled substance while holding a position of trust or security clearance."  (Government Exhibit 5 at 2-3.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant filled out a Government questionnaire on September 13, 2001, which asked, "Have you EVER illegally used a controlled substance while 
employed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing a security clearance; or while in a position directly or immediately 
affecting public safety?"  The Applicant answered, "No."  (Government Exhibit 4 at question 28.)  (Emphasis in original.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant denied both of these allegations in his answer.  While the Applicant did serve in the armed forces and admitted in his sworn statement using 
marijuana from 1976 to 1978, there is no evidence in the record that the Applicant held a security clearance during that time.  Accordingly, the Government 
failed to make its case under this Guideline.   Paragraph 2 and its subparagraphs are found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant submitted an extensive statement in response to the FORM.  In this statement the Applicant is very open about his foolish use of marijuana both 
in the service and afterwards.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The statement also includes an Eagle Award Nomination Form.  This form indicates that the Applicant is well thought of by his superiors.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline H (Drug involvement)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) any drug abuse;<A HREF="02-06441.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) the drug involvement was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of drug abuse and personal conduct that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's 
part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has used illegal drugs (Guideline H).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has overcome the Government's case.  As stated above, Paragraph 2 of the SOR is found for the Applicant because of a lack 
of evidence.  Even assuming that the Applicant did have a security clearance in the period 1976-1978, there is little or no evidence that he intentionally falsified 
his questionnaire concerning his use of marijuana during that time.  In his questionnaire he freely admitted his more current drug use, which ended not even two 
years before the questionnaire was completed.  In his sworn statement the Applicant openly speaks about his entire drug abuse history.  The available evidence 
shows that the Applicant is vague and uncertain today about whether he held a security clearance over 20 years ago.  Such uncertainty is understandable and 
does not show an intent to deceive.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Turning to the marijuana use, the Applicant has not used marijuana for over five years.  He expresses considerable remorse about his resuming marijuana use in 
the 1990s, when he was retired from the armed forces, a mature person, and should have known better.  A demonstrated intent not to use marijuana in the future 
has been shown.  The possibility of continuance or recurrence is virtually nil.  Mitigating Conditions 1 and 3 apply to his case.  Paragraph 1 is found for the 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  
Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the 
Government's Statement of Reasons.</SPAN></P>
