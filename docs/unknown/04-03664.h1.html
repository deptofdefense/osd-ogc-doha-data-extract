<P>Applicant is a 48-year-old aerospace engineer who has worked for the same federal contractor since 1998. He is a dual citizen of Germany and the United

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On October 24, 2005,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating it was unable to find that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged 
security concerns under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline C (foreign preference) and Guideline B (foreign influence).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">November 17, 2005</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. In his SOR responses, Applicant 
admitted SOR allegations in &para;&para; 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and denied allegations in &para;&para; 1.f, 2.a through 2.d. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on December 12, 2005. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A 
notice of hearing was issued on January 19, 2006, scheduling the hearing for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">February 7, 2006. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government 
submitted seven exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-7. The exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified 
on his own behalf, two witnesses testified for him and he submitted eight exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits A-H. Applicant requested that the 
Adjudicated Guidelines under AE A,<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> be used to determine security clearance eligibility. Department Counsel objected stating that until implementing 
provisions have been approved and specific direction received from the Director DOHA on the specific implementation date, the current guidelines should be 
used. I ruled until directed to use the new guidelines I am bound by the direction of the Director DOHA. The objection was sustained. The exhibits were 
admitted without additional objections. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 27, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR, are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 48-year-old aerospace engineer who has worked for the same defense contractor since 1998. He was born of German parents who immigrated to 
the United States in 1956. He was born in the United States in 1957, and is an American citizen. In approximately 1964, Applicant's family moved back to 
Germany. His parents remained U.S. citizens and were permanent resident aliens in Germany. Applicant currently holds a secret security clearance that he has 
held consistently since approximately 1996.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1985, while in Germany, Applicant researched his viability to be a German citizen.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> He proved to German authorities that his ancestry was German, 
complied with their regulations, and he was therefore entitled to be a German citizen.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The German government then recognized him as such and he assumed 
dual citizen status as a United States and German citizen. Applicant's motivation for pursuing German citizenship was because he had completed his schooling 
in Germany and because he was not a German citizen, he would be required to obtain a labor permit to work in Germany.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> At the time it was very difficult for 
non-members of the European Union to obtain labor permits, so he became a German citizen and benefitted from his status. He was 28 years old at the time. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While in Germany, Applicant was employed by a private company which had a contract with the German Space Agency from about 1988 to 1995.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> He is 
eligible for a German pension commensurate with the time he worked in Germany.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's brother, is also a dual citizen of Germany and the United States, living in Germany with his wife and child who are citizens of Germany. His 
brother works in quality assurance for a private razor company.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> All of Applicant's other relatives, except two cousins that he has minimal contact with, live in 
Germany.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> He is very close to the maternal side of his family, that includes an aunt, uncle, and two cousins and their children.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> He visits them about once a 
year. He maintains contact with his brother and aunt monthly and the other relatives about quarterly.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Although not as close to the paternal side of his family, 
he has given his paternal cousin a power of attorney to attend to his financial affairs in Germany.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> He does not have very much contact with his paternal uncle 
and aunt and their other two children. Applicant travels to Germany approximately once a year to visit family and maintain his pilot's license. While there he 
usually stays with his aunt.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a friend who works for the Germany Space Agency. He has worked there for 21 years. Applicant met him when they both attended the same 
college and shared classes. Later they worked on the same team at the German Space Agency. He and Applicant became very close friends and he would 
celebrate special family occasions with him and would babysit his children.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> They continue to maintain contact usually through email correspondence. They 
have visited each other  sometimes while on personal travel and sometimes combined with a business trip, both in the United States and Germany.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> The last 
time they visited each other was in December 2003. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also has a friend who is a Lieutenant Colonel in the German Army, currently serving as a military assistant to the German Ambassador to a foreign 
country.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> They have known each other since 1963, when they were boys. They maintain contact through email and Applicant also communicates with his 
friend's wife.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a German driver's license that has no expiration and remains valid.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> He obtained a German Identification Card in 1985, that he was required to 
have as a German citizen living in Germany.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> It became invalid when he moved to the United States, although he still retains it. Applicant jointly owns, with 
other family members, a one quarter interest in two small parcels of land in Germany.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> It is valued at approximately $3,500. Applicant intends on retaining his 
property interest in the land. He also has investment interests in Germany and owns approximately $15,000 worth of German bonds that will mature in 
approximately 2008, and may be valued at around $20,000.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> Applicant did not know if only German citizens could buy these German bonds. He also maintains 
a German checking account that he uses when he is in Germany. He also uses this account to pay annual premiums of approximately $1,200-$1,500 on a 
German life insurance policy and for presents for his family.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> The policy is an investment tool that will mature when he is 62 years old and he will receive 
about $50,000. His niece is the beneficiary. He does not own any U.S. life insurance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a pilot's license that he obtained in Germany and returns there annually to complete the mandatory requirements to keep it current.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> He maintains 
a U.S. pilot's license that must be used with his German license for the U.S. license to be valid. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant moved to the United States in 1995 for economic reasons. He believed he would have a better quality of life in the United States and he would be 
able to own his own home. Applicant believes he has held a German passport since approximately 1985, and reapplied for one in 1999 at the German Consulate 
in Los Angeles, California.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> He obtained the passport so it would be easier for him to travel to Germany and throughout the European Union.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> He has since 
relinquished his German Passport to the German Consulate who defaced it and declared it invalid.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> However, the invalidation by the German Consulate 
specifically stated that it did not affect the status of Applicant's German citizenship and he was still considered a German citizen.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> Applicant considers himself 
a dual citizen of Germany and the United States.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> Applicant is not willing to renounce his German citizenship.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> He stated "I have been raised in a German 
culture, and I do not believe by simply making the paper statement of giving up my German citizenship, that that would prove anything. It would not effect any 
contacts or any emotions or any feelings that I have towards Germany. It would simply be a paper statement, but it would not personally affect any ...any 
emotions that I have for Germany."<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> He believes that having a German passport holds himself out as a German citizen.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> He has maintained a valid U.S. 
passport for as long as he can remember.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> He stated his primary loyalty is to the United States.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant owns a home in the United States assessed at approximately $165,000, with about $50,000 worth of equity.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> He has retirement investments in the 
United States worth about $145,000.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> The majority of his assets are in the United States. His mother resides with him. He believes he has a much better quality 
of life in the United States than he would be able to attain in Germany.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant advises his security facilities officer when he travels to Germany and if he has any foreign contacts.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A> He is aware of the pertinent requirements for 
foreign travel. Applicant voted in Germany when he was living there as a dual citizen from 1985 to 1995.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> He did not participate in United States elections 
during this time. Once moving to the United States he participated in U.S. elections. Applicant has not served in either the German or American armed forces. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Three witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. They describe him as very conscientious about security rules and regulations. He is extremely diligent, often 
taking the lead in ensuring classified material is secured and handled properly. He is considered thorough and could always be counted on to do things right. He 
is considered to be very serious about his security responsibilities and played a role in training other employees about security issues. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Germany is a federal republic. It emphasizes close ties with the United States and is a member of North Atlantic Treaty Organization.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A> The United States policy 
towards Germany is to maintain and preserve a close and vital relationship, not only as friends and trading partners, but also as allies.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Considering the evidence as a whole, 
Guideline C, pertaining to foreign preference, and Guideline B, pertaining to foreign influence with their respective DC and MC, apply in this case. 
Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, 
the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding 
circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the 
probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or 
against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">him.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline C-Foreign Preference is a security concern because when an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the 
United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B-Foreign Influence is a concern because a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons 
to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligations are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial 
interest in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guidelines C and B.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) E2.A3.1.2.1 (<EM>The exercise of dual citizenship); </EM>FP DC E2.A3.1.2.2 (<EM>Possession 
and/or use of a foreign passport);</EM> FP DC E2.A3.1.2.4 (<EM>Accepting educational, medical, or other benefits, such as retirement and social welfare, from a foreign 
country);</EM> FP DC E2.A3.1.2.5 (<EM>Residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements); </EM>FP DC E2.A3.1.2.6 (<EM>Using foreign citizenship to protect 
financial or business interest in another country); </EM>and FP DC E2.A3.1.2.8 (<EM>Voting in foreign elections)</EM> apply. Applicant sought, applied for, and secured 
German citizenship in 1985. He obtained and used his German passport. The possession and/or use of a foreign passport is an exercise of dual citizenship. He 
used his passport for travel to Germany and the European Union. A foreign preference can be shown by an applicant's exercise of the rights and privileges of 
foreign citizenship for reason of personal convenience or expediency.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_49_"><SUP> (49)</SUP></A> Use of a foreign passport for personal convenience is not extenuating or mitigating.<A HREF="04-03664.h1.html#N_50_"><SUP> (50)</SUP></A> He 
has since had his passport invalidated by the German consulate, but retains his dual citizenship. Applicant worked as a German citizen in Germany and is 
eligible for a pension. He voted in Germany while living there and then voted in U.S. elections while living in the U.S. Applicant has investments in German 
bonds and accepted educational benefits while residing in Germany. All of the above disqualifying conditions apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition<EM> </EM>(FP MC) E2.A3.1.3.1 (<EM>Dual citizenship is 
based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country); </EM>(FP MC) E2.A3.1.3.2<EM> (Indicators of possible foreign preference (e.g. foreign military 
service) occurred before obtaining United States citizenship); </EM>and FP MC E2.A3.1.3.4 (<EM>Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual 
citizenship),</EM>and conclude none apply. Applicant actively and purposely pursued becoming a German citizen. It is something he sought out and had to go to 
German authorities to prove. He exercised his German citizenship by investing in German bonds, having a German bank account and life insurance, and using 
his German passport to travel in the European Union. He also has a German driver's license and German pilot's licence that he returns to Germany annually to 
renew. Applicant's foreign preference occurred because he applied to become a German citizen. He plans to maintain his dual status and is not willing to 
renounce his German citizenship. In accordance with a memorandum issued by Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communication, and 
Intelligence, Arthur L. Money, dated August 16, 2000, (Money Memorandum), a security clearance must be denied or revoked for an Applicant with a foreign 
passport "unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport." Surrender of the passport contemplates returning it to the issuing authority. Applicant returned 
his German passport to the appropriate authority. Although he has relinquished his German passport, Applicant intends to continue to exercise his dual citizen 
status. He considers himself emotionally tied to Germany. I find none of the above mitigating conditions apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1 (<EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual 
has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country),</EM> and FI DC E2.A2.1.2.8 (<EM>A substantial financial interest in a 
country, or in any foreign -owned or operated business that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence) </EM>apply. Applicant's brother is a dual 
citizen of the U.S. and Germany. His sister-in-law, niece, aunt, uncle and cousins are all citizens and residents of Germany. Applicant is very close to his aunt, 
uncle and cousins and stays with them when he visits Germany. He owns property with his aunt and brother. He communicates with his brother and aunt 
monthly. Applicant also has a two close friends in Germany that he has close ties of affection with, one a friend he worked with, celebrated special occasions 
with, and even cared for his children. He and his friend visit each other and maintain email communication. His other friend a Lieutenant Colonel in the 
German Army, has been a friend since childhood and they maintain contact through emails. Both friends are individuals with close ties of affection to 
Applicant. In addition, both friends work for the government, one is a senior officer in the German army, the other is a long time employee of the German Space 
Agency. Applicant owns real property in Germany, maintains a bank account, investments in German bonds, and a life insurance policy. Applicant maintains a 
dual economic life in both the U.S. and Germany.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1 (<EM>A determination that the 
immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign 
power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the 
United States);</EM> FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3 (<EM>Contacts and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent); </EM>and FI MC E2.A2.1.3.5 (<EM>Foreign financial 
interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities)</EM> apply<EM>. </EM>Applicant maintains close ties with his family in Germany. 
Applicant's relationship with his relatives and friends is more than casual and infrequent. Although his family members are not likely agents of a foreign power 
because of his affection and loyalty to them their contact is more than casual and infrequent. He is very close to his family, communicating often and visiting 
annually. Applicant's friends are agents of a foreign power by virtue of their jobs. He maintains contact with them and visits when they are traveling for 
business or pleasure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The question is whether Applicant's relatives and friends are in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force Applicant to choose 
between loyalty to his relatives vice the United States. Another consideration is whether these people are vulnerable to exploitation in such a way as to have 
Applicant act adversely to the interests of the United States. A factor to consider, while not determinative, is an analysis of the character of the foreign power 
and entities within the foreign country. This review is not limited to countries that are hostile to the United States. Friendly countries may have profound 
disagreements with the United States or have engaged in espionage against the United States especially in economic, scientific, military, and technical fields. A 
friendly relationship is not determinative, but it may make it less likely that a foreign government would attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen through relatives or 
associates in that country. Although there are terrorist activities and components in most country, Germany is a country with longstanding close ties with the 
United States. The United States has maintained a large military presence in Germany since World War II and conducts numerous joint military and civilian 
operations. Although at times Germany may disagree with the United States on political issues it does not have a history of human rights violations or 
exploitation of its citizens. I find Applicant's relationship with his family and friends in Germany is not the type that would be exploited. Every person with a 
relative in another country could pose a risk. I have balanced that probability in this case and find due to the nature of the relationship between the United States 
and Germany, that the risk does not rise to the level of potential exploitation. I find Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns regarding his 
family and friends in Germany. I find the potential vulnerability is minimal.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has substantial financial interests in Germany. Although he has greater accumulated wealth in the United States, he still maintain a bond investment 
valued at $15,000 today and estimated to be more at maturity in 2008, a German life insurance policy that will mature when he is 62 and be worth $50,000, a 
checking account with about $1,200 to $1,500 in it, and he owns two parcels of land in Germany. Applicant's financial interests are not minimal and sufficient 
to potentially affect his security responsibilities. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding his financial interests under Guideline B, foreign 
influence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered the whole person and kept in mind that any doubt as to whether access to classified information must be resolved in favor of national security. 
Applicant is a citizen of both Germany and the United States and maintains strong ties to Germany. He has family, friends, and financial interests there. 
Although Applicant has held a security clearance since 1996, his continued exercise of dual citizenship is a serious concern. Balancing the potentially 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions and considering the totality of all the evidence, I conclude Applicant has failed to meet his heavy burden and failed to 
mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines C. I also find that although he has mitigated the security concerns regarding his family and friends, he has not 
mitigated the concerns regarding his financial interest. Therefore, I find he has failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline B. </SPAN></P>
