<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This forty four year old Applicant has used marijuana for many years, through at least November 2003, including after he completed a Security Clearance 
Application (SCA) and responded to the Statement of Reasons (SOR) .   In a May 2002 signed, sworn declaration and in his September 2003 response to the 
SOR, Applicant indicated that he intended to continue using marijuana in the future. The application of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 disqualifies him from eligibility.</SPAN> 
itigation has not been shown. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 29, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued an SOR to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons under Guideline H 
(Drug Involvement) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether 
clearance should be granted or denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated October 4, 2002, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He requested that his case be decided on the written 
record in lieu of a hearing. On October 29, 2002, a second SOR was issued and on September 30, 2003, Applicant filed a signed and sworn response again he 
requested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Subsequently on November 7, 2003, Applicant requested that this matter be 
decided based on a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 29, 2004, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to 
the parties on February 2, 2004, and the hearing was held on March 11, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered sixteen documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1 through 16), and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered 
one documentary exhibit (Applicant Exhibit A), and offered his own testimony. All of the documents were entered into evidence without objection. The revised 
and corrected transcript (TR) was received on March 30, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the SOR. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The SOR contains four allegations, 1.a. 
through 1.d., under Guideline H (Drug Involvement). </SPAN>  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits three allegations 1a. through 1.c. These allegations are 
incorporated as findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and the testimony of 
Applicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is 44 years old. He is the president and CEO of a company that is pursuing work as a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in 
connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">abuses illegal substances. Applicant estimated that his first usage 
of  marijuana occurred during his senior year in high school in approximately 1978. With some exceptions , he continued to use marijuana approximately two 
times a week (Tr at 42, Exhibit 11). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is some dispute as to when, or if, Applicant has stopped his usage of marijuana. In a signed, sworn statement he made to a DSS agent on May 17, 2002, 
Applicant stated, "If I have  marijuana I will use it again."  While at the hearing Applicant testified that he had last used marijuana in May 2003 (Tr at 42), in 
his September 30, 2003 response to the SOR he admitted that he planned to continue using marijuana. In a letter written by Applicant on November 7, 2003, he 
stated regarding his drug usage, "If eliminating its use entirely creates a new opportunity to secure the desired security clearance, consider it done" (Exhibit 14). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude that Applicant continued using marijuana after his May 2002 statement to the DSS, after the May 2003 date that he claimed to have stopped using 
marijuana during testimony at the hearing, and after the September 2003 response to the SOR. I believe Applicant continued using marijuana, at least until 
November 7, 2003, the date of Exhibit 14. While Applicant now claims to have no future intention to use marijuana, based on the inconsistency of his 
statements, I cannot conclude that he does not plan to continue to use marijuana in the future. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.</SPAN> Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to 
an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline H (Drug Involvement) </STRONG> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Concern: </SPAN>Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. 
Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</P> 
 
<P>Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:</P> 
 
<P>(E2.A8.1.1.2.1.) drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or 
cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens); and(E2.A8.1.1.2.2.) inhalants and other similar substances.</P> 
 
<P>Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.</P> 
 
<P>On June 7, 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a Memorandum, <EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances 
as Mandated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. The memorandum provides policy guidance for the 
implementation of Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United States 
Code, to add a new section (10 U.S.C. &sect; 986) that precludes the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense under specific 
circumstances. The situation described above involves one of those specific circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><EM></EM>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</P> 
 
<P>a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P> 
 
<P>c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>e. The voluntariness of participation</P> 
 
<P>f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</P> 
 
<P>g. The motivation for the conduct</P> 
 
<P>h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P> 
 
<P>I. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </P> 
 
<P>The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly<STRONG> </STRONG>consistent<STRONG> </STRONG>with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day. The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and conduct that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</P> 
 
<P>The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future." The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this 
order...shall be</P> 
 
<P>a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegation set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between Applicant's conduct and 
the continued holding of a security clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM></EM> case. Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that Applicant has used illegal drugs for many years under (Guideline 
H). Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case against him.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) </STRONG></SPAN>With respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case. Applicant's improper and illegal drug 
abuse, including the possession and use of marijuana, is of concern, especially in light of his desire to have access to the nation's secrets. Applicant's overall 
conduct pertaining to his illegal substance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A8.1.2.1. (<EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">any drug abuse</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">), and DC 
E2.A8.1.2.2. (</SPAN><EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's stated  intention to continue using marijuana in the future <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in his signed, sworn statement made to a DSS agent </SPAN>and in his Response to the SOR falls 
within DC E2.A8.1.2.5. (<EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by a credentialed medical professional. Recent drug 
involvement, especially following the granting of a security clearance, or an expressed intent not to discontinue use, will almost invariably result in an 
unfavorable determination</SPAN>). I do not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC) applies to guideline H.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, under the circumstances herein, Applicant's lengthy period of illegal substance abuse plus his indication as recently as September 2003, that he will 
continue to use marijuana , brings his conduct within the scope of provision 2 of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 in that he </SPAN><EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is an unlawful user of a controlled substance.</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The 
application of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 disqualifies him from eligibility. </SPAN>Accordingly, Paragraph 1of the SOR is concluded against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT.</SPAN></P>
