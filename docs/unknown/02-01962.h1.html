<P>Applicant's financial irresponsibility was not mitigated where Applicant's debts were caused both by circumstances beyond her control and her own 
irresponsibility and where she had taken no effective action to address her indebtedness, despite having the means to do so. Applicant did not falsify her 
financial history because she was unaware of an alleged state tax lien at the time she completed her clearance application. Clearance denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 6 January 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="02-01962.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Applicant 
answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on 14 March 2003, and received by me and set the same day. On 18 March 2003, I 
issued a notice of hearing for 3 April 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, the Government presented seven exhibits--six admitted without objection--and no witnesses;  Applicant presented three exhibits--admitted 
without objection--and the testimony of three witnesses, including herself. DOHA received the transcript on 11 April 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, I gave Applicant until the close of business on 25 April 2003 to provide me with copies of any financial records relating to the allegations in the 
SOR. To date, I have received no submissions from Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted  the allegations of subparagraphs 1. a., d., e., g., h., i., j., and k. of the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate these admissions as findings of fact. 
She denied subparagraph 1.b. because she claims to have paid the auto loan in full. She denied subparagraph 1.c. because she  disputes the amount of damage 
claimed by the landlord. She denied subparagraph 1.f. because she claims that it is a duplicate of subparagraph 1.g., albeit for a different amount. She denied the 
allegation of paragraph 2.<A HREF="02-01962.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 47-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. She has previously held a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 8 May 2001, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA)(SF 86)(G.E. 1) on which she truthfully disclosed a variety of adverse financial 
circumstances, including a 1996 IRS lien for $19,000.00 in taxes and penalties. The SOR alleges that she failed to disclose a state tax lien for back taxes filed in 
1999. Applicant testified that she was unaware of the lien until she was given a copy of it at the hearing (G.E. 7).<A HREF="02-01962.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> I find her testimony credible on this point. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges Applicant's 11 delinquent credit accounts totaling approximately $26,573.00. Except for 1.k. ($19,000.00), 1.c. ($4,117.00),1.i. ($1,164.00), 
and 1.a. ($914), none of the debts are over $500.00. However, only the debt at 1.j. ($412.00) has been paid, despite the fact that Applicant has the apparent 
means to begin payment on the small accounts and none of the remaining small accounts are more than $300.00.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although the debts (to the same cable company) at 1.f. and 1.g. have different amounts and different account numbers, I accept Applicant's claim that the 
accounts are the same. Applicant disputes the debt at 1.b., asserting that she had paid off the amount owed on the automobile, but did not provide corroboration 
of that claim. She also disputes the amount of the damage asserted by her former landlord in 1.c.<A HREF="02-01962.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> However, Applicant has taken no formal action to contest the 
landlord's asserted claim.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant attributed her past due accounts to a variety of factors: sporadic support from her self-employed husband, later separation and ultimate divorce from 
him in 2000, a separated  daughter--and three of the daughter's four children--living with her, and her husband's failure to accurately report his self-employment on their joint IRS returns. She asserts that the medical debts at d. and e. are co-pay amounts required by her divorce decree to be paid by her former 
husband, but has provided no corroboration of that claim.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant is currently making payments on only one of the debts alleged in the SOR, the IRS lien, and that only because the IRS is seizing her income tax 
refunds. She has been unable to avail herself of "innocent spouse" protections, although she has refiled her petition. She is also preparing an offer in 
compromise to the IRS, but is waiting to see the IRS response to her former spouse's offer in compromise. She tried credit counseling, but gave it up when the 
agency fees left virtually nothing to pay her creditors.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's co-worker considers her an honest employee who is not a security risk. Applicant's daughter confirms that she is living with Applicant, but unable 
to contribute much to family finances because of her own domestic situation. Applicant's daughter also confirms that the debts at 1.h. and 1.i.--while in 
Applicant's name--are for wireless and telephone service fees generated by the daughter and her husband while living in Applicant's house.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant acknowledges her debts and states a desire to satisfy them. However, she admits she has taken no action to pay even the small debts that she does not 
dispute in any fashion (1.g. and 1.h.). Nor has she taken any action to enter into a repayment plan for the larger debts that she does not dispute (1.a. and 1.i.). 
She puts the needs of her family ahead of her personal finances. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section 6.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS (GUIDELINE F)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.1. The Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3.3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment. . . divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PERSONAL CONDUCT (GUIDELINE E)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2A5.1.1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Concern</SPAN>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. . . </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2. A5.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts  from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.3. Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and  material matters to an investigator, . . . in connection with a 
personnel security or trustworthiness determination;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOReasons. If the government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to 
the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly establishes Applicant's indebtedness and her current unwillingness to 
address that indebtedness. While circumstances beyond her control may have contributed to the original indebtedness in some instances, she has taken no 
effective action to address the debts that she does not dispute or to take effective action to dispute the debts she disagrees with. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her financial difficulties are both recent and not isolated; indeed they are ongoing. It 
does not appear that Applicant has stopped digging herself into a financial hole, much less started to pull herself out of it. I resolve Guideline F against 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline E. Applicant disclosed the financial difficulties she was aware of, but did not know that the state had 
filed a tax lien for back taxes in 1999. I resolve Guideline E for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
