<P>Applicant erroneously omitted his misdemeanor citations in 1994 and 1999 for marijuana possession from his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) in March 
2001. However, he did not intend to conceal the information or mislead the government about it. Because Applicant lacked the requisite intent to mislead, no 
disqualifying conditions apply. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On May 23, 2003, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant 
a Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-17465.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline E (personal conduct). The SOR further 
informed Applicant that, based on information available to the Government, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant's security clearance.<A HREF="02-17465.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>On June 16, 2003, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) and requested that his case be decided without a hearing.<A HREF="02-17465.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant has admitted with an 
explanation the single SOR allegation. </P> 
 
<P>On December 29, 2003, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant materials (FORM) in support of the government's preliminary decision, a copy 
of which was sent to Applicant on January 22, 2004. Applicant received the FORM on February 5, 2004. He thus had until March 6, 2004, to submit any 
response, rebuttal, or objection to the FORM. However, Applicant did not submit anything further in his own behalf and the case was assigned to me on March 
29, 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's aforementioned admission is incorporated herein as facts. A<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional 
findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 27 years old and is employed by a defense contractor as a security guard. He has been with his current employer since April, 2001. He also worked 
as a security guard for a different company from 1998 until 2001. He is married and has two children. Applicant graduated from high school in 1994 and has 
held a variety of jobs since then. This appears to be his first employment with a defense contractor and his first application for a security clearance. </P> 
 
<P>In October 1994, Applicant was with some friends outside a recreation center when a police officer approached the group and saw a small quantity of marijuana 
on the ground near them. Applicant, who had just turned 18 years old, and his friends were issued citations for possession of marijuana. When he appeared in 
court several months later, the charges were dropped.</P> 
 
<P>In November 1999, Applicant was pulled over by the police because the car he was driving - his brother's - had a burned out tail light. The police conducted a 
search of the car and found the remnants of a marijuana cigarette in the ashtray. Applicant again received a citation for possession of marijuana and assigned a 
court date. When Applicant appeared in court his license was suspended for six months and the possession charge was dropped. </P> 
 
<P>Both of these charges are misdemeanors under the applicable laws of the state where they occurred. In neither of the aforementioned incidents did the marijuana 
belong to Applicant; nor does it appear he knew the drugs were present until the police found them. Further, in neither of the aforementioned incidents was 
Applicant taken into custody, photographed, or placed in jail.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on March 28, 2001. In response to question 24, which asked if he had ever been arrested or 
charged with any criminal offense related to drugs or alcohol, Applicant answered "no."<A HREF="02-17465.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> When interviewed about his arrests and his answers to the SF 86 by a 
Defense Security Service (DSS) agent on October 19, 2001, Applicant stated he did not intentionally falsify his answers. He further explained that he did not 
understand the question and that he thought the word "charge" meant an actual custodial arrest and prosecution, neither of which occurred in his case.<A HREF="02-17465.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="02-17465.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the SOR allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative 
guidelines to be applied here are those conditions listed in the Directive under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="02-17465.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted 
facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the 
Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's case. Because no 
one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="02-17465.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's 
suitability for access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="02-17465.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline E, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a security concern arises where it is shown an applicant has exhibited  questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such conduct may indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified 
information.<A HREF="02-17465.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN> Here, the government's concerns are about Applicant's honesty in situations where the truth may not be favorable to Applicant's personal 
interests.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The SOR alleges that Applicant falsified question 24 in an electronically-submitted SF 86 dated May 1, 2001. However, the only security 
questionnaire provided in the FORM is a handwritten SF 86 dated March 28, 2001. (Item 4) The question at issue in Item 4 is question 23.d, which poses the 
same question as that quoted in SOR 1.a, albeit in a different format. It is also worth noting that Applicant did not answer question  23.d in Item 11. 
Nonetheless, Applicant discussed his alleged SF 86 omission with a DSS agent in October 2001, and he has admitted the allegation as presented in the SOR. 
Therefore, I conclude Department Counsel has presented sufficient evidence in the FORM to establish that Applicant deliberately omitted relevant and material 
information about his background from a security clearance form.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E disqualifying condition (DC) 2<A HREF="02-17465.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> appears to apply  here.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> However, a key facet of this guideline is that there be a deliberate attempt to mislead or 
conceal. I do not believe that element is present here. Just because a person erroneously answers "no" to a question does not mean he intends to conceal 
information from the government to protect his own interests. Applicant has offered a perfectly plausible explanation for his omission. He was never taken into 
custody, fingerprinted and photographed, or jailed; rather, he was given what amounts to a traffic ticket in each instance. Both times the charges were 
dismissed. It is perfectly understandable that Applicant did not equate two minor infractions in which he was not culpable<A HREF="02-17465.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> and for which he was not 
prosecuted, with formal criminal charges and arrests. As attorneys, we know that even a parking ticket is, technically, a charge that one has violated a law or 
ordnance even though we have not been detained or locked up. But for the average, lay applicant, receiving a summons may not necessarily equate with being 
charged with a crime. The circumstances in this case are not unlike instances in which an applicant who has a felony arrest in his past fails to respond 
affirmatively to SF 86 question 23.a, which asks if one has in fact been charged with or convicted of a felony, because the charge was later reduced to a 
misdemeanor. Or the applicant may simply not know the difference. I conclude, therefore, that this Applicant lacked the requisite intent to mislead but simply 
made an understandable mistake. Thus, I conclude no disqualifying conditions apply and I resolve Guideline E for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under each applicable adjudicative 
guideline. To the extent possible given the paucity of information in this regard, I have also considered the whole person concept as contemplated by the 
Directive in Section 6.3, and as called for by a fair and commonsense assessment of the record before me as required by Directive Section E2.2.3.</P>
