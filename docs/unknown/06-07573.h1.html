<P>Applicant was convicted in military court for his role in an insurance-fraud scheme in 2000. He was sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge and confinement for six months. Although he  presented a 
good case in mitigation, it is not strong enough to overcome the negative security implications of his dishonest and deceitful criminal conduct. Clearance is denied. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is challenging the Defense Department's preliminary decision to deny or revoke his eligibility for a security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,<A HREF="06-07573.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> on 
June 16, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR--which is in essence the administrative 
complaint--alleges security concerns under Guideline J for criminal conduct and Guideline E for personal conduct (falsification). On July 28,  2005, Applicant replied to the SOR and  requested a 
hearing.</P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to me on September 19, 2006, and a notice of hearing was issued scheduling the case for October 19, 2006. Applicant appeared without counsel and the hearing took place as 
scheduled. At Applicant's request, I left the record open until November 17, 2006, to allow him to submit additional documentary evidence. Without objections by department counsel, the 
following post-hearing matters are admitted: (1) Exhibit B-a letter from Applicant's facility security officer; and (2) Exhibit C-seven monthly evaluations from Applicant's employer. DOHA 
received the hearing transcript November 13, 2006.   </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR in light of dropping or withdrawing one of the two falsification allegations under Guideline E. Without objections, the motion to amend was granted. 
Accordingly, the SOR, as amended, reads as follows:</P> 
 
<UL> 
  <LI>SOR &para; 1 alleging criminal conduct under Guideline J now consists of the following two subparagraphs:</LI> 
 
 
<P>a. On February 28, 2000, you were charged with (1) making a false report; (2) conspiracy to commit larceny; and (3) attempt to commit larceny by the United States Navy. You were confined until 
your general court-martial on July 11, 2000, when you pled guilty to making a false report. You were sentenced to six months of imprisonment and to receive a bad-conduct discharge.</P> 
 
<P>b. You falsified your May 21, 2004, security-clearance application, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001, a federal felony, as set forth in subparagraph 2.b, below.</P> 
 
<UL> 
  <LI>SOR &para; 2 alleging personal conduct under Guideline E now consists of the following two subparagraphs:</LI> 
 
 
<P>a. You engaged in conduct as set forth in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b, above.<A HREF="06-07573.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>b. You falsified material facts on a security-clearance application, Standard Form 86, executed by you under date May 21, 2004, in response to "Question 33. Your Financial Record - Bankruptcy   
In the last 7 years have you filed a petition under any chapter of the bankruptcy code (to include Chapter 13)?" You deliberately failed to disclose that you had filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 7 
on April 30, 2004, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division. </P> 
 
<P>As a result, my findings of fact and conclusions are limited to the amended SOR. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In reply to the SOR, Applicant admitted the criminal conduct in SOR &para; 1.a, but he explained that he is now a different person compared with when the incident happened six years ago when he was 
young and used poor judgment. Concerning SOR &para; 2.b, he admitted not listing his Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in response to Question 33 of his security-clearance application, but he explained that 
when he completed his application he had not yet filed for bankruptcy. He further explained that his application was done in June 2003, but his company misplaced it and he was unaware that it was 
found and resubmitted. In addition, I make the following findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P>1. Applicant is a 28-year-old man who is employed as an electrician technician. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance for his employment with a federal contractor. </P> 
 
<P>2. Applicant married in May 2000. He and his wife have three children, to include a stepson whom Applicant has parented since the child was about three years old. His stepson is now ten, his son 
is four, and his daughter is six months old. </P> 
 
<P>3. In February 2000, while serving as a sailor on active military duty, Applicant was charged by Navy authorities for his role in an insurance-fraud scheme involving his automobile. A few months 
later in July 2000, Applicant pleaded guilty to attempted larceny, conspiracy to commit larceny, and making a false official statement (Exhibit 3). Based on his guilty pleas, a military judge sitting as 
a general court-martial convicted Applicant and sentenced him to confinement for six months and a bad-conduct discharge. The convening authority approved the sentence as adjudged. Nearly five 
years later in March 2005, a military court of criminal appeals affirmed the convictions for the three offenses and the sentence. Further legal review was denied, and Applicant received his discharge 
certificate (DD Form 214) reflecting a bad-conduct discharge in about August 2005. Since his release from confinement, Applicant has had no further criminal activity (e.g., arrests, charges, or 
convictions). </P> 
 
<P>4. In affirming Applicant's general court-martial case, the court of criminal appeals described some of the facts developed during the guilty-plea hearing (Exhibit 3). The court noted Applicant 
provided the location of his vehicle and his keys so that his co-conspirator could dispose of the vehicle. After that, Applicant made a false report to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and his 
insurance company that his vehicle had been stolen. His actions were all part of a scheme to collect the insured value of his vehicle from the insurance company. The co-conspirator got the vehicle 
and burned it.  In doing so, a co-conspirator suffered burn injuries. The information about the manner in which the co-conspirator disposed of the car and the injury suffered by a co-conspirator was 
admitted as aggravation evidence during the presentencing stage of the general court-martial.   </P> 
 
<P>5. On April 30, 2004, Applicant and his wife sought financial relief by filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. The summary of schedules reveals that Applicant was claiming total assets of about 
$17,181, consisting of personal property, and total liabilities of $47,878, consisting primarily of $31,368 in Schedule F unsecured debt (Exhibit 2). The case was processed during the next few 
months and the bankruptcy court granted Applicant and his wife a discharge on August 9, 2004 (Exhibits 2 and A).</P> 
 
<P>6. To obtain a security clearance, Applicant was required to complete a security-clearance application (Exhibit 1). In signing it, he was required to certify that his statements were true, complete, and 
correct to the best of his knowledge and belief and made in good faith. Also, he acknowledged that a knowing and willful false statement on the application could be punished by a fine or 
imprisonment or both under federal law. Applicant did not mention the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in the application. In particular, in response to Question 33, he denied filing a petition under any 
chapter of the bankruptcy code within the last seven years. </P> 
 
<P>7. There is some confusion about when the paperwork was initiated to obtain a security clearance for Applicant. The application's first page is dated February 25, 2004, and it was signed by 
Applicant on May 21, 2004 (Exhibit 1). It shows that Applicant first started working for a federal contractor in June 2003.  </P> 
 
<P>8. According to a letter from his facility security officer (FSO) (Exhibit B), Applicant's next employer was the sister company of his present employer from July 29, 2004, through August 19, 2005. 
In this position, he did not require a security clearance. Then from August 22, 2005, until the present, Applicant has worked for his present employer. Subsequently, in February 2006, the FSO was 
notified that Applicant needed a security clearance to perform his job duties. The FSO checked the system and learned that Applicant had an investigation opened on July 26, 2004, three days before 
starting with the sister company. <STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>9. Applicant testified about the circumstances surrounding his security-clearance application.</P> 
 
<P>He explained that he first started working for a federal contractor on June 10, 2003, and was asked to complete a security-clearance application a few days later (R. 60). He did so using a software 
program designed for that purpose (R. 60-61). In early 2004, he inquired about the status of his application and was told to resubmit it because it could no longer be found (R. 61). He resubmitted  
another application in February 2004 by accessing the file saved on a disk (R. 61-61). He believes he resubmitted it on or about February 25<SUP>th</SUP>, the date on the security-clearance application at issue 
here (R. 62). A few months later in May 2005, he was asked to sign a hard copy version of his application (R. 62). Also, he explained that he thought a bankruptcy was required to be reported in 
response to Question 33 once the case had been completed as opposed to when the petition was filed (R. 52-53). </P> 
 
<P>10. Concerning his court-martial conviction, Applicant explained that the incident was a mistake he made as a young man. He is moving forward with his life, trying to stay positive. He describes 
his conviction as a changing point in his life, and he does not intend to ever go back to such an ordeal. </P> 
 
<P>11. Applicant considers himself hardworking, he's eager to learn and move up the ranks in his field. His monthly performance evaluations (Exhibit C) are uniformly good, rating his job 
performance in various areas as competent, commendable, or exceptional. The most recent evaluation, dated November 1, 2006, describes Applicant as a dependable, hardworking employee who 
can be counted on to get the job done. </P>

<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for 
each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria 
and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept.<A HREF="06-07573.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government must be able to 
have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination of an 
applicant's loyalty.<A HREF="06-07573.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance. </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN> </CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>1. The Criminal Conduct Security Concern</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline J,<A HREF="06-07573.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> criminal conduct is a concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. A history of illegal 
behavior indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling sensitive information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, a criminal conduct security concern is raised under Guideline J. The record evidence shows Applicant has a history of criminal conduct based on his 
general court-martial conviction in July 2000. He pleaded guilty to three offenses (attempted larceny, conspiracy to commit larceny, and making a false official statement) stemming from his role in 
an insurance-fraud scheme. He received serious punishment, as evidenced by a punitive separation from the Navy (the bad-conduct discharge) and confinement for six months. Indeed, a bad-conduct discharge, while less severe than a dishonorable discharge, is a severe punishment and carries with it a certain stigma recognized by our society. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I reviewed the MCs under the guideline and conclude that some apply in Applicant's favor. First, the insurance-fraud scheme and his court-martial conviction took place in  2000. Since his release 
from confinement, there has been no further criminal activity. Given the passage of time since then, his criminal conduct is not recent within the meaning of the guideline.<A HREF="06-07573.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Second, although 
Applicant pleaded guilty and was convicted of three distinct offenses under military law, his offenses stemmed from a single course of conduct as opposed to multiple offenses over a period of 
months or years. Viewed in this light, Applicant's insurance-fraud scheme in 2000 was an isolated incident within the meaning of the guideline.<A HREF="06-07573.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> Third, there is evidence of rehabilitation<A HREF="06-07573.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> based 
on the following: (1) the passage of time since his release from military confinement without further criminal activity; (2) his employment as an electrician technician with defense contractors since 
June 2003 and his good employment record (Exhibit C); and (3) his family involvement as a husband and father to three young children. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>2. The Personal Conduct Security Concern</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct under Guideline E<A HREF="06-07573.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> is always a security concern because it asks the<STRONG> </STRONG>central question: Does a person's past conduct justify confidence the person can be trusted to properly 
safeguard classified information. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security 
clearance or in other official matters is a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully. </P> 
 
<P>An omission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the 
information did not need to be reported. </P> 
 
<P>To prove the falsification allegation, the government relied on the security-clearance application, the bankruptcy records, and its cross-examination of Applicant. Although substantial evidence is a 
low standard, the evidence here is not sufficient to prove that Applicant gave a deliberately false answer when he responded "no" to Question 33 about bankruptcy. The state of the evidence is a 
muddle due to the circumstances surrounding the completion and submission of his application. It appears he initially submitted an electronic version of his application in June 2003. He submitted 
another on or about February 25, 2004. At both times, this was before the Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition was filed on April 30, 2004. He was then asked to sign a hard copy version of his previous 
electronic application. He signed it on May 21, 2005, which amounted to certifying that the answers he gave in February 2005 were true and correct. Muddling the situation further is his layman's 
misunderstanding of when a bankruptcy was considered filed for purposes of responding to Question 33. Taken together, these circumstances persuade me that Applicant was not trying to 
deliberately omit or conceal the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case from his security-clearance application. Accordingly, no DCs under Guideline E apply and it will be decided for Applicant. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>3. The Whole-Person Concept</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have also considered the available information in light of the nine factors of the whole-person concept.<A HREF="06-07573.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> Each factor is discussed below.</P> 
 
<P>First, the nature, extent, and seriousness of his conduct are noteworthy because his crimes show dishonesty and deceit. His offenses involved a plan where he agreed with at least one other person to 
engage in criminal conduct for financial gain. To carry out the plan, he made a false statement to military law-enforcement and his insurance carrier. As a result of the conspiracy, Applicant's 
vehicle was torched and an individual suffered burn injuries. Given these circumstances, I consider his offenses quite serious. </P> 
 
<P>Second, the circumstances surrounding the conduct show that Applicant was a knowledgeable participant in the insurance-fraud scheme. It was his car and he stood to gain by making a false 
insurance claim. </P> 
 
<P>Third, the frequency and recency of his conduct are noteworthy. This was essentially a one-time event that happened more than six years ago and has not recurred. </P> 
 
<P>Fourth, he was a relatively young man, about 21 or 22, when he committed these crimes. </P> 
 
<P>Fifth, his participation in the scheme was voluntary. There is no evidence suggesting he was pushed, forced, or coerced into committing these offenses. </P> 
 
<P>Sixth, as discussed above, there is ample evidence of rehabilitation. </P> 
 
<P>Seventh, the motivation for the conduct appears to be a lack of financial means to repair his car (R. 71), and the insurance-fraud scheme was the way Applicant chose to remedy the problem. In that 
regard, I note that Applicant went through Chapter 7 bankruptcy rather recently in August 2004. </P> 
 
<P>Eighth, the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress stemming from his conduct is unlikely. His court-martial conviction is a public record, and he has put the matter behind him, 
getting on with his life. </P> 
 
<P>And ninth, the likelihood of continuation or recurrence of similar conduct is, as always, difficult to measure, but it appears to be low. Applicant is now six years older, a  husband and father to three 
young children, and a hardworking, dependable employee. </P> 
 
<P>Considering the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the criminal conduct security concern arising under 
Guideline J. Although he presented a good case in mitigation, his crimes reeked of dishonesty and deceit, which cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. After weighing the 
disqualifying and mitigating information and giving substantial weight to the seriousness of his crimes, I conclude his case in mitigation is not strong enough to overcome the negative security 
implications of his criminal conduct. In reaching this decision, I considered all the evidence, both favorable and unfavorable, including any evidence not specifically discussed. Applicant has not 
met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  </P>
