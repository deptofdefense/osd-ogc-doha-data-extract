<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 29-year-old data entry clerk who worked for a government contractor and her government manager recommends her highly. Her previous 
employer was a law firm for two years until fired for being late to work. She was injured on the job in an accident when several boxes were spilled on her 
requiring therapy causing her absence. Applicant was arrested in 1994 for grand larceny, pled guilty, and was sentenced to one year, suspended, two years 
probation, and community service. She did not report either the conviction or the discharge on her application for a security clearance and this omission is 
charged as criminal conduct. The Personal Conduct has not been mitigated but there is no proof of criminal conduct. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On October 7, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
<P>On October 15, 2004, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. The matter was assigned to me on December 22, 2004. A notice of 
hearing was issued on January 5, 2005, and a hearing was held on January 18, 2005. Four government exhibits and two exhibits for Applicant were admitted 
into evidence. A security investigator testified for the government and the Applicant testified. The transcript was received on January 26, 2005.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted with explanations the two specific SOR allegations regarding omissions of information from her application for a security clearance (SF 
86). After a complete review of the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 29-year-old data entry clerk who has worked for a government contractor assigned to work at the Department of State on security issues. The 
employment lasted over three years until terminated as a result of this proceeding. Her government manager speaks highly of her work and dedication to the job 
(Exh. A). </P> 
<P>Before working for the government contractor she was employed by a law firm for two years as a quality control specialist. She was fired for being late to work 
several times. While employed at the law firm she was injured on the job in a freak accident when another firm employee or a private contractor spilled several 
boxes on her that required her to have medical treatment. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>In 1994, when she was 18 years old, Applicant was arrested in Virginia for grand larceny of a coat from a department store, pled guilty, and was sentenced to 
one year confinement, suspended, with two years probation, and 100 hours of community service plus a fine and costs. She did not report either the conviction 
or the discharge on her SF 86 submitted in May, 2002. In December, 2004, she requested information from the District of Columbia on her criminal record and 
information came back to her stating that she had no record (Exh. B). </P> 
<P>Applicant discussed both of the omissions with a security investigator on November 19, 2002 (Exh. 4). The investigator's report indicates failure to fully reveal 
the reasons for the discharge and a theory that there was no record of the conviction (Exh. 4). <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. "Any doubt as to whether 
access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all 
allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive, questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified information. (E2.A5.1.1.) The Government has established that Applicant has been 
involved in a pattern of rule violations (E2.A5.1.2.5.) and has failed to give complete and accurate information on her SF 86. (E2.A5.1.2.2.) The allegations 
include the fact that these willful omissions constitute a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001, a felony.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant stated that she believed the discharge did not need to be reported since she had intended to resign when the issue of tardiness was raised by her 
employer and thus did not report it as a firing. She stated that she believed she was not required to report the larceny since she believed when the sentence was 
served no record existed of the crime. She offered the District of Columbia report in evidence to substantiate the reasonableness of her belief although it does 
not establish the fact. She denied she deliberately withheld the information and noted that she voluntarily discussed both issues with the investigator.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) is also applicable to Applicant. The Government has established a sufficient basis that Disqualifying Condition E2.A10.1.1. is 
applicable to Applicant in that she withheld information on the SF 86 that was a possible violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 making such deliberate withholding a 
criminal offense. It could be mitigated by application of the facts in the case to certain of the Mitigating Conditions (MC) if the conduct was not deliberate. 
While withholding the information was done deliberately, I do not find that it rises to the level required to conclude that it was criminal in nature, but only that 
it was in violation of Guideline E.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All the criminal conduct with which she was charged and convicted occurred over 11 years ago and she has not had any criminal record since that time. The 
discharge from the law firm was seemingly over very minor matters particularly in view of the fact that the proximate cause of the problem was as a result of 
medical attention for an accident occurring in the workplace from negligence by either an employee or contractor of the law firm. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking 
into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Although Applicant is an impressive person 
of talent who has risen in her last employer's company to a responsible position, her failure to fully report adverse information on two instances leads me to the 
conclusion that it is premature to grant a security clearance. While she expresses regret for the conduct and the omissions on the SF 86 she has offered excuses 
that are not sufficient to justify a clearance under the guidelines. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude Applicant's record of conduct 
justifies a finding that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1. Guideline E:  AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P>
