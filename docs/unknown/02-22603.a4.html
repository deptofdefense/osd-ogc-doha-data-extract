<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On October 17, 2003, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Jan. 2 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April 26, 2004, after the hearing, Administrative Judge  Richard A. Cefola 
denied Applicant's request for a security clearance. Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  The Appeal Board remanded 
the case back to the Administrative Judge on September 3, 2004.  The Judge issued a new unfavorable decision on September 17, 2004.  Applicant timely 
appealed.  The Board remanded the case on August 9, 2005.  The Judge issued  a new unfavorable decision on November 2, 2005.  Applicant timely appealed.  
The Board remanded the case on December 22, 2005. The Judge issued a new unfavorable decision on December 29, 2005.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant 
to Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge erred in addressing Applicant's drug involvement as criminal conduct; 
whether the Judge's decision was arbitrary capricious and contrary to law; whether the Judge erred by failing to provide due process; whether the Judge erred by 
failing to amend the SOR.</P> 
 
<P>The Board now has a complete file in the case.  Because it is uncontested that Applicant's history of criminal conduct places his case under the current 
prohibitions of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986,<A HREF="02-22603.a4.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clear that Applicant may not be granted a security clearance by the Department of Defense.  The Board need not reach the 
other issues raised by Applicant in his appeal.  The Administrative Judge's ultimate adverse conclusion must be sustained.</SPAN></P>
