</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is 35 years old and has worked for a federal contractor doing sheet-metal repairs since 1999. Applicant was arrested in 1999, for possession of 
marijuana. Applicant failed to divulge his arrest on his security clearance application, despite being on notice that it was an issue. He failed to mitigate security 
concerns under Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline J, criminal conduct. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P>.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On December 22, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges security concerns under Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline J, criminal conduct.</P> 
<P>In a sworn statement dated January 4, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. In his statement Applicant elected to have his case decided on the 
written record. Department Counsel submitted the government's file of relevant material (FORM) on May 20, 2005. The FORM was mailed to Applicant on 
September 27, 2005, and received on October 13, 2005. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, 
or mitigation. Applicant did not provide any additional material. The case was assigned to me on November 30, 2005. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR, are incorporated herein, In addition, after a through and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I 
make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is 35 years old and has been a fabrication sheet metal worker for a federal contractor since 1999. Applicant is married and has two children. 
Applicant served in the Navy from 1989 to 1992 and was honorably discharged. </P> 
<P>Applicant was arrested on April 24, 1999, and charged with possession of marijuana. Applicant was stopped by a police officer for having a broken headlight 
on his car. His wife was in the car at the time. The police officer saw a marijuana cigarette in the car's ashtray. Applicant was a friend of the police officer's and 
was told he would have to go to court and pay a fine. Applicant believed the police officer was going to list his arrest under a false name so the arrest would not 
show up on Applicant's record.<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He went to court, pled guilty and was ordered to pay fines and court costs totaling approximately $315.00. </P> 
<P>On May 22, 2003, Applicant provided information on a electronic security clearance application (SCA) that was then submitted on May 23, 2003.<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> On that 
application Applicant answered "No" to Question 24 (<EM>Your Police Record-Alcohol/Drug Offenses-Have you ever been charged or convicted of any offense(s) 
related to alcohol or drugs? For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been 'sealed' or otherwise stricken from the 
court record. The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an 
expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 .U.S.C. 3607."<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> </EM>Applicant's answer was false in that he had been charged and convicted of drug 
possession in 1999. </P> 
<P>In a sworn statement to an investigator from the Defense Security Service (DSS) on October 2, 2003, Applicant admitted he intentionally did not provide the 
requested information. Applicant's explanation was that he thought his police officer friend had concealed his name when he was given a ticket for possession 
of marijuana, and that it would therefor not be on his record.<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Applicant also claimed the marijuana did not belong to him, but was his wife's.<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> He admitted that 
he did not provide information about his arrest on his SCA, and it was only after the investigator read him the police report regarding the marijuana possession 
charge did he admit the incident occurred.<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Applicant stated "It was my understanding that this arrest was not supposed to show up on my record. The police 
officer, my friend, who charged me with this offense insured me that<STRONG> </STRONG>it would appear under the name of "[Blank Doe]" rather than my name. That is the reason I 
did not list this drug related offense on my security questionnaire."<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On May 12, 2004 Applicant submitted another  SCA. Before signing it he swore under oath that the information was true, complete and correct to the best of 
his knowledge and belief and was made it good faith. He attested that he understood that a knowing and willful false statement on the form could be punished 
by fine or imprisonment or both under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. <A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Applicant again answered "No" to Question 24 (<EM>Your Police Record-Alcohol/Drug Offenses-Have 
you ever been charged or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs? For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your 
case has been 'sealed' or otherwise stricken from the court record. The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal 
Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 .U.S.C. 3607." </EM>Applicant's answer was 
false in that he had been charged and convicted of drug possession in 1999. His false answer constitutes a felony violation under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>In Applicant's answer to the SOR he contradicts his previous sworn statement to the DSS investigator regarding his arrest stating "I was given a ticket for 
simple possession of marijuana. I was not arrested or detained."<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> He again complained that, because of the alleged promise that his police officer friend made 
to him, the arrest should not have been part of his record.<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Considering the evidence as a whole, 
Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, and Guideline J, pertaining to  criminal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, apply in this case. Additionally, 
each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding 
circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the 
probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or 
against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against </P> 
<P>him.<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="03-24159.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Based upon consideration of all the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
<P>Guideline E-Personal Conduct is a security concern when an individual's conduct involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </P> 
<P>Guideline J-Criminal Conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior indicates 
an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling classified 
information.</P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a prima facie case for disqualification under 
Guideline E and Guideline J.</P> 
<P>Based on all the evidence, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant 
and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine 
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM> <EM>),</EM>applies in 
this case.</P> 
<P>Despite being on notice that his previous falsification about his drug arrest had raised a security concern, Applicant deliberately falsified his SCA on May 12, 
2004. PC DC E2.A5.1.2.2 applies. There is a consistent pattern to Applicant's responses regarding his drug charge and it is that he did not believe the charge 
was part of his record because he thought a police officer friend was going to falsify a police report for him. He does not deny the charge, or that he pled guilty, 
and paid a fine, but rather his concern is that the charge should have been concealed for him as an act of friendship by a police officer. The plain language of the 
question put Applicant on notice that even if the record had been expunged or in his case concealed in an illegal manner, he still was required to divulge the 
drug charge. Applicant's actions were deliberate and meant to mislead. Applicant's willingness to hide his past and his lack of truthfulness demonstrate 
questionable judgment and dishonesty that makes him vulnerable as a security risk. </P> 
<P>I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) E2.A5.1.3.2 (<EM>The falsification was 
an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily), </EM>PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3 (<EM>The individual made 
prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts),</EM>and<EM> </EM>PC MC E2.A5.1.3.5 (<EM>The individual has taken positive steps to 
significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress). </EM>I conclude none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant deliberately 
concealed his drug charge because he thought it would not show up on his record where the government could find out about it. He failed to divulge the charge 
to the DSS investigator until confronted with the police report. Applicant continues to believe that because he thought his police officer friend was going to 
conceal the charge he did not have to report it on his SCA, and in his latest statement he argues that he was not really arrested. Applicant's falsifications are not 
isolated, but rather show a continuing pattern of deception. He did not volunteer the required information until confronted with it. Applicant failed to show any 
positive steps towards reducing his vulnerability, but rather continues to contradict himself regarding his transgressions. Applicant failed to mitigate the security 
concerns regarding his personal conduct. </P> 
<P>Based on all the evidence Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of 
whether the person was formally charged), </EM>and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser charges) </EM>apply. Applicant was arrested and 
charged with possession of marijuana in 1999. He pled guilty to the offense. Applicant falsified his SCA by deliberately denying he had been charged or 
convicted of any offense related to drugs. Applicant's falsification was made under oath and is a violation of 18 U.S. C. &sect; 1001, a felony.</P> 
<P>I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>The conduct was not 
recent),</EM> CC MC E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>The crime was an isolated incident), </EM>CC MC E2.A10.1.2.4 (<EM>The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors 
leading to the violation are not likely to recur)</EM>, and CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6 (<EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation)</EM>. I conclude Applicant's offense 
of deliberately providing false information is criminal and recent. The combination of his drug and falsification offenses negate that his crimes were isolated. 
CC MC E2.A10.1.2.1 and CC MC E2.A10. 1.2.2 do not apply. Applicant's deliberate omissions were voluntary, he still believes he was somehow justified in 
concealing the sought after information. Therefore, I find both CC MC E2.A10.1.2.4 and CC MC E2.A10.1.2.6 do not apply. I find Applicant failed to mitigate 
the security concerns regarding his criminal conduct. </P> 
<P>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
<P>I considered all the evidence provided and also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our 
national interests. I find Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his personal conduct and criminal conduct. Therefore, I am persuaded 
by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Accordingly, 
Guideline E and Guideline J are decided against Applicant.</P>
