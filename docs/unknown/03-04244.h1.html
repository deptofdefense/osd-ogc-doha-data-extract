<P>Applicant had a delinquent debt of over $21,000, was arrested and charged with DUI in 1991 and 1998, and was involved in several domestic affrays between 
1997 and 1999. Applicant mitigated the financial considerations, criminal conduct, and alcohol consumption security concerns. He failed to mitigate the 
security concerns raised by his failure to list his arrests, charges, and convictions on his security clearance application. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 3 June 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-04244.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 6 July 2004 
and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 19 January 2005. On 31 March 2005, I convened a hearing to 
consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript 
(Tr.) on 12 April 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 33-year-old electronic technician for a defense contractor. He was married between January 1993 and January 1995. He has two children by his 
ex-wife. Tr. 14.</P> 
<P>Applicant had over $21,000 in delinquent debt from student loans. He started making payments in April 2004 and has kept them up to date. He owes the IRS 
$1,500 for tax year 2004 that he stated he would pay before it was due on 15 April. Applicant was late on his mortgage twice in the past seven years, but is now 
current.</P> 
<P>In September 1991, police stopped Applicant for driving a vehicle with only one headlight. After they determined he had consumed alcoholic beverages, he was 
tested with a Breathalyzer that revealed a blood-alcohol content of 0.135%. He was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and consuming alcohol 
while a minor. After he was arrested, Applicant was placed in jail where he broke a light in his cell trying to get his jailer's attention that he needed a drink of 
water.</P> 
<P>Sometime after his divorce, Applicant moved back in with his ex-wife. In April 1997, Applicant went out with some friends despite his ex-wife's protestations. 
She was pregnant at the time. After he returned home, Applicant, who had been drinking, and his ex-wife became embroiled in a physical dispute. Applicant 
went to the police department for assistance. The police observed injuries to both Applicant and his ex-wife. They were both charged with domestic 
violence/assault. The judge dismissed the offenses.</P> 
<P>In January 1998, Applicant and his ex-wife had another physical confrontation after which his ex-wife called the police. Applicant, who had been drinking 
alcohol, was arrested. The charge was dismissed.</P> 
<P>In April 1998, police stopped Applicant for driving erratically. He was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol after refusing to participate in field 
sobriety tests. He took a breath test that showed a blood-alcohol content of 0.109. He refused the second breath test. Applicant was permitted to plead guilty to 
two traffic offenses and paid a fine.</P> 
<P>In November 1999, Applicant and a girlfriend had an argument that led to police being called to his home. They had been living together until shortly before the 
incident. Applicant had been drinking with friends just prior to the incident. Police arrested and charged him with domestic violence/assault. Applicant was 
convicted of the offense and fined.</P> 
<P>Applicant completed an Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire (EPSQ) worksheet. Module 24 asked if he had ever been "charged with or convicted of 
any offense(s)<A HREF="03-04244.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> to alcohol or drugs," "regardless of whether the record in your case has been 'sealed' or otherwise stricken from the record." Applicant answered 
"no." Module 26 asked Applicant if, in the previous seven years, he had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed" in other 
modules "regardless of whether the record in your case has been sealed or otherwise stricken from the record." Applicant answered "no," listed a domestic 
violence incident, but noted the date of the offense as "unk." </P> 
<P>Human resources personnel input the information on the worksheet into the computer to produce an electronic security clearance application (SCA). The SCA 
was printed out and given to Applicant to review and sign. Apparently because Applicant answered "no" to module 26 on the worksheet and failed to list the 
date of his domestic violence offense, the human resources personnel input the answer "no" to question 26. Applicant signed a printout of the electronic SCA 
on 6 May 2002, certifying that his statements were "true, complete, and correct" to the best of his knowledge and belief, and acknowledging that a "knowing 
and willful false statement" could be punished under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. Ex. 1 at 8.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was indebted to a creditor on seven accounts totaling over $21,000 (&para; 1.a). Applicant admitted this indebtedness. An 
applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions establish potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline F</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant has a history of not meeting 
his financial obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1) and was unable or unwilling to satisfy his debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3). His $21,000 debt resulted from educational loans 
that he failed to pay in a timely manner. Nevertheless, Applicant is now in good standing on the loans, does not have any credit cards, and appears to be coping 
with his current bills and expenses. Applicant has made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. MC E2.A6.1.3.6. Under all the circumstances, I conclude 
Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concern. I find for Applicant on &para; 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J--Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was arrested and charged with domestic violence/assault in April 1997 (&para; 2.a) and January 1998 (&para; 2.b); was arrested and 
charged with simple assault in November 1999 (&para; 2.c); was arrested and charged with DUI in April 1998 (&para; 2.d); and was arrested and charged with DUI and 
underage drinking in September 1991 (&para; 2.e). Applicant admitted each of the allegations. A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions establish potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline J. Applicant has a history of criminal 
behavior and has been involved in multiple lesser offenses. DC E2.A10.1.2.2. But the offenses were not recent. MC E2.A10.1.3.1. The Government has not 
alleged, and there is no evidence to support a finding that, Applicant committed any criminal conduct in more than five years. Under all the circumstances, I 
find for Applicant on &para; 2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified material facts on his SCA by denying he had been charged with or convicted of any alcohol-related offenses (&para; 
3.a) or been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not listed in answer to other questions (&para; 3.b). Applicant denied the allegations. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct 
involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could 
indicate the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence established potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline E. Applicant failed to report his alcohol-related arrests and 
conviction in answer to question 24 and his other arrests in answer to question 26 on his EPSQ worksheet or in his SCA. The deliberate omission of relevant 
and material facts from any SCA is disqualifying. DC E2.A5.1.2.2. An applicant's criminal history is relevant and material to a determination of his security 
worthiness. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant claims he did not report his 1991 arrest for DUI because he forgot and he should not have been arrested. He asserts he was being harassed by a 
policeman. He claims he did not list his 1998 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DUI arrest because he was not drunk and was told by the court that it would be removed from his record. He 
asserts he did not believe he had to list the domestic assaults of which he was not convicted. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">If Applicant did not list his arrests, charges, or convictions over the previous seven years elsewhere on his SCA, he had to list them in answer to question 26. 
On the EPSQ worksheet, he listed only the sole domestic violence offense of which he was convicted. I have no doubt Applicant fully understood the 
questions-that he was to list all alcohol-related offenses for which he had ever been charged or convicted (question 24) and any offenses not listed elsewhere of 
which he had been arrested, charged, or convicted in the previous seven years. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Except for the November 1999 conviction, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant deliberately failed to list 
these offenses. He applied his own rules and standards for answering the questions. Unless he was convicted or he personally believed he was guilty of the 
offense, he would not list it. This demonstrates Applicant's unreliability and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that are the focus of personal 
conduct security concerns. I find against Applicant on &para; 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>G-Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was arrested for DUI in April 1998 (&para; 4.a) and charged with DUI and underage drinking in 1991 (&para; 4.b); and was 
intoxicated when he was arrested for domestic violence/assault in April 1997 (&para; 4.c), for domestic violence/assault in January 1998 (&para; 4.d), and for simple 
assault in November 1999 (&para; 4.e). Applicant denied the general allegation of excessive alcohol consumption, but failed to address each specific allegation in &para; 4 
of the SOR. Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the 
risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Directive &para; E2.A7.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions establish potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">G.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant was involved in alcohol-related incidents away from work-the DUI and the domestic affrays. DC E2.A7.1.2.1. But the incidents occurred a number of years ago (more than five years 
ago) and there is no indication of a recent problem. MC E2.A7.1.3.2. Under all the circumstances, I find for Applicant on &para; 4.</SPAN></P>
