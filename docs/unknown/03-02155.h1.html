<P>Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance.  In 1987, Applicant pled guilty to and was convicted of aggravated 
sexual battery of a child, and indecent liberties with children, between 1985 and 1986.  He was sentenced to 13 years confinement, but was paroled after about 4 
years in jail.  Applicant also admitted to sexual crimes against a child in 1981.  Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his sexual 
offenses.  Also, under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, the Department of Defense may not grant or continue a security clearance for any applicant who has been sentenced by a 
U.S. court to confinement for more than one year, absent a waiver from the Secretary of Defense.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>, (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>, (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (the "Directive"), the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On October 24, 2003, DOHA issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.  The SOR alleges security concerns raised under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, Guideline D, Sexual 
Behavior, Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline K, Security Violations, of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on December 15, 2003.  He elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  </P> 
<P>Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on June 21, 2004.  Department Counsel provided a complete copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM) to Applicant, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  
Applicant received the FORM on June 24, 2004, but did not provide additional materials for consideration within the required time.  The case was assigned to 
me on August 10, 2002.  Subsequently, Applicant submitted an undated personal statement which was received August 12, 2004, without objection, and 
included in the record.  </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted all the factual allegations under Guideline J concerning criminal conduct.  Item 2, Applicant's Answer to SOR, dated December 15, 2003, at 
1-2.  He also admitted the factual matters alleged under Guideline K concerning security violations, but included matters in explanation and extenuation.  <EM>Id.</EM>  
Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  Applicant denied the allegations under Guideline D, Sexual Behavior, and Guideline E, Personal 
Conduct.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is 53 years old, and works for a defense contractor.  Item 3, Security Clearance Application, dated October 1, 2002, at 1.  He seeks a security 
clearance.  </P> 
<P>Applicant joined the U.S. Navy in 1973.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 3.  He was married in November 1977, and had a child of the marriage in 1979.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 2, 3.  Applicant's 
marriage was marked by marital disputes.  Item 5, Statement of Applicant, dated July 21, 1997, at 3-4.</P> 
<P>In 1981, Applicant sexually molested his daughter on several occasions.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 4.  The molestation continued over several years and several homes.  <EM>Id.</EM>  </P> 
<P>In 1985, during an argument with his wife, Applicant grabbed his wife's arm, twisted it behind her back, and held her against the wall.  Item 5, <EM>supra</EM>, at 2.  
Applicant's wife reported an assault to naval and civilian police authorities.  Item 8, Incident/Complaint Report, dated October 22, 1985.  Applicant was 
confined temporarily by civilian authorities, but the charges were dropped and he returned to the barracks.  Item 5, <EM>supra</EM>, at 2.</P> 
<P>Applicant molested his daughter in 1985 and 1986.  Item 4, Court Order, dated July 21, 1987, at 1.  This included having his daughter and a neighbor's children 
watch as Applicant performed explicit sexual acts.  Item 5, <EM>supra</EM>, at 4. <EM> </EM>The neighbor's children reported the incident.  <EM>Id.  </EM>In about July 1986, Applicant was 
arrested by state authorities.  Item 6, Naval Investigative Service Report, dated September 18, 1986, at 1.</P> 
<P>After Applicant's arrest by civilian authorities, he was ordered to reside in military barracks.  Item 9, Naval Investigative Service report, dated February 19, 
1987, at 1.  He was held in arrest on the miliary installation.  Item 5, <EM>supra</EM>, at 5.  Military members were detailed to move his personal items from his home to 
his barracks.  <EM>Id.</EM>  The service members discovered a notebook containing classified materials lying on a living room coffee table.  <EM>Id.</EM>  Applicant admitted 
possessing the notebook, and indicated that it was accidentally included among his personal items when he moved from a ship to a series of residences ashore.  
Investigators also learned that, while assigned on board a ship, Applicant  was detailed as a Special Task Person with daily access to classified information.  
Item 5, <EM>supra</EM>, at 5.  He occasionally had Top Secret messages in his bunk during sleep period.  <EM>Id.</EM>  Applicant asserted the ship was open for storage of 
classified materials (Top Secret and below) in personal quarters.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 5.</P> 
<P>The U.S. Navy administratively discharged Applicant and released him to the state for trial.  <EM>Id.</EM>  State authorities charged Applicant with Indecent Liberty with 
a Child, Aggravated Sexual Battery, and Forcible Sodomy.  Item 2, <EM>supra</EM>, at 1.  In March, 1987, Applicant pled guilty to aggravated sexual battery and indecent 
liberties.  <EM>Id.</EM>; Item 4, <EM>supra</EM>, at 1; Item 5, <EM>supra</EM>, at 7.  The state court sentenced Applicant to ten years confinement for the aggravated battery, and three years 
confinement for the indecent liberties, to run consecutively, however, the court suspended the execution of five years of the sentence conditioned upon 
Applicant's good behavior upon release from confinement.  Item 4, <EM>supra</EM>, at 2.</P> 
<P>Applicant served about four years in state confinement, and was released on parole in May 1991.  Item 5, <EM>supra</EM>, at 7, 8.  Since that time, he has met the 
requirements of his parole.  He lives with his mother and sister in the United States.  He enrolled in college, attends church regularly, and makes his child 
support payments on time.  Item 5, <EM>supra</EM>, at 8.  Applicant is registered in the state as a child molester.  <EM>Id.</EM>  Applicant has worked for federal contractors since at 
least 1995.  Item 3, <EM>supra</EM>, at 1.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>In Executive Order 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM>, &sect; 3.1(b) (August 4, 1995), the President provided that eligibility for access to classified 
information shall be granted only to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength 
of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, 
and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  A person granted access to classified 
information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those 
individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of 
the applicant.  Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a 
clearance.</P> 
<P>To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in 
this case are: </P> 
<P>Guideline J, Criminal Conduct: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive, 
&para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> D, Sexual Behavior:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject 
the individual to coercion, exploitation, or duress, or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.  Directive, &para; E2.A4.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E, Personal Conduct: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive, &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> K, Security Violations: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Noncompliance with security regulations raises doubt about an individual's trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to 
safeguard classified information.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Directive, &para; E2.A11.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, 
reliable information about the person. <EM> Id.</EM>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age 
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
<EM>Id.</EM>  <BR> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.  Directive, &para; E3.1.14.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  Directive, &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent 
with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive, &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 7, 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum implementing these restrictions on the grant or renewal of security clearances.  <A NAME="7996-8"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The 
memorandum provides that provision regarding criminal convictions "disqualifies persons with convictions in both State and Federal courts, including UCMJ

</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's documentary matters and Applicant's admissions constitute substantial evidence of several disqualifying conditions under Guideline J of the 
Directive.  Paragraph E2.A10.1.2.2 of the Directive provides that it may be a disqualifying condition if an applicant commits a "single serious crime."  
Paragraph E2.A10.1.2.1 also indicates that "admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged" may be disqualifying.  
Applicant admitted committing serious sexual offenses against his daughter in 1981.  He also admitted to the sexual offenses against his daughter and the 
neighbor's children in 1985 and 1986 that resulted in his state convictions and sentence.  The evidence shows a history and pattern of criminal activity that 
creates doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Directive, &para; E2.A10.1.1.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1.c of the SOR asserts Applicant was arrested by civilian police authorities in 1985 and charged with assault, but the charges were later dismissed.  
Applicant admitted this allegation. Item 2, <EM>supra</EM>, at 2.  However, he asserted he acted to prevent his wife from assaulting him and to calm her down.  Item 5, 
<EM>supra</EM>, at 2.  The file does not include a statement from Applicant's former spouse.  The only other evidence in the record concerning this incident is the 
complaint report summarizing the statement Applicant's former spouse gave the police.  Item 8, <EM>supra</EM>, at 2.  She said that she got into a heated argument with 
Applicant and he twisted her arm behind her back.  <EM>Id.</EM>  Considering that the former spouse's version of events is consistent with Applicant's explanation and 
that the charges were dismissed, I conclude the substantial evidence is insufficient to show Applicant engaged in criminal conduct as alleged in &para; 1.c of the 
SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concerns arising from Applicant's convictions can be mitigated where it is determined that the criminal behavior was not recent.  Directive, &para; 
E2.A10.1.3.1.  The offenses in this case were not recent; Applicant's last offense occurred in 1986.  However, considering the especially egregious nature of the 
crimes, and the length of time they continued, the passage of years mitigates the offenses only slightly.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">If the crime was an isolated event, that may be a mitigating factor.  Directive, &para; E2.A10.1.3.2.  Applicant's offenses against his daughter were not isolated 
incidents; rather they were a course of continuing conduct spanning many years.  This mitigating condition does not apply here.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It may also be mitigating where there is "clear evidence of successful rehabilitation."  Directive, &para; E2.A10.1.3.6.  Applicant indicated he served his sentence to 
confinement, became active in the church, enrolled in college, satisfied the conditions of his parole, and remains a law-abiding citizen.  Notably lacking, 
however, is any indication Applicant sought, received, or completed medical assessment or treatment for the conditions that caused him to commit sexual 
offenses against his daughter and the neighbor's children.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the circumstances, including the mitigating conditions, in light of the "whole person" concept.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the 
security concerns arising from his criminal conduct involving sexual offenses against children.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, the Department of Defense may not grant or continue a security clearance for any applicant who has been sentenced by a U.S. court to 
confinement for more than one year, absent a waiver from the Secretary of Defense.  Applicant is subject to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 by virtue of being sentenced to 
thirteen years in confinement as a result of the convictions for sexually abusing minor children.  Under the circumstances, I am required to find against 
Applicant on &para; 1.d of the SOR.  As my adverse security decision against Applicant is not based solely on the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, it is inappropriate 
for me to make a recommendation as to whether Applicant's case should be considered for waiver.  ISCR Case No. 02-00500 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2004) 
(citing DOHA Operating Instruction 64 &para; 3.e.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline D, Sexual Behavior.<EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Sexual behavior may raise security concerns where it involves a criminal offense, it makes the individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress, or it 
reflects a lack of discretion or judgment.  Directive, &para; E2.A4.1.1.  The Government's documentary matters are substantial evidence of two disqualifying 
conditions under the Directive: &para; E2.A4.1.2.1, "[s]exual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted," and &para; E2.A4.1.2.4, 
"[s]exual behavior . . . which reflects a lack of discretion or judgment."  Applicant's repeated, aggravated, sexual offenses against several children clearly 
constitutes criminal behavior.  These acts include those for which he was convicted and punished and those to which he confessed and was not prosecuted.  The 
behavior also demonstrates a serious lack of judgment and discretion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concerns arising from this misconduct may be mitigated under certain conditions.  It may be mitigating if the conduct "was not recent and there is 
no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature."  Directive, &para; E2.A4.1.3.2.  Applicant's offenses were not recent, and there is no evidence he committed 
similar offenses since his confinement.  However, considering the egregious nature of the offenses, and the fact that they continued for a substantial number of 
years, this mitigates the offenses only slightly.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It may also be mitigating where there is no other evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotional instability.  Directive, &para; E2.A4.1.3.3.  This 
mitigating factor does not apply here.  In addition to Applicant's sexual offenses, he admitted several occasions where domestic disputes turned into physical 
altercations, and at least one period where he considered suicide and made a suicidal gesture.  Item 5, <EM>supra,</EM> at 3.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, it may be mitigating where the sexual behavior at issue "no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress."  Directive, &para; E2.A4.1.3.4.  
Applicant submitted that he could not be "blackmailed" about his sexual offenses because it is a matter of public record and he is registered in the state as a 
"child molester."  Item 5, <EM>supra</EM>, at 8.  Undoubtedly, the public nature of his conviction and his registration as a sexual offender substantially diminishes 
Applicant's vulnerability to coercion.  Nonetheless, there is no indication it is a matter widely known within Applicant's business or personal community, and 
Applicant's history is still a matter that would evoke public opprobrium.  For these reasons, I do not find this to be a significant mitigating factor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E, Personal Conduct.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's documentary matters relating to Applicant's sexual offenses also constitute disqualifying conditions under Guideline E of the Directive, 
concerning personal conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, or unreliability.  Directive, &para; E2. A5. 1.1.  The Government's documentary 
proof of the sexual offenses constitutes "reliable, unfavorable information" that raises a security concern under &para; E2.A5.1.2.1.  They also increase Applicant's 
"vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress" because if they became widely known, they "may affect [Applicant's] personal, professional, or community 
standing . . . ."  Directive, &para; E2.A4.1.2.4.  As discussed above, the fact that some of Applicant's crimes are included in the public record diminishes somewhat 
his susceptibility to coercion or duress for those matters.  Nonetheless, they are still likely to adversely affect his personal, professional, or community standing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It may be mitigating if the person involved "has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress."  
Directive, &para; E2.A5..1.3.5.  As noted above, Applicant's guilty plea, the successful completion of his sentence and terms of probation, and the public record of 
his offenses diminish, but do not eliminate, Applicant's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress arising from his previous sexual offenses against 
children.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline K, Security Violations</STRONG>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's documentary matters and Applicant's admissions demonstrate a disqualifying condition under &para; E2.A11.1.2.2 of the Directive: negligent 
violation of a security regulation.  Service members moving Applicant's personal property found classified material among Applicant's personal papers in his 
residence.  Applicant indicated he possessed the classified material while assigned to a ship, and it was accidentally included within his personal belongings 
when he left the ship.  He indicated it stayed with his personal belongings through several successive moves.  The classified material was found among personal 
papers on his coffee table.  Applicant indicated "this is the only times [sic] I had any secret or classified materials at home or anywhere not designed for access 
of these materials."  Item 5, <EM>supra</EM>, at 6.  This indicates Applicant negligently violated regulations concerning the proper storage of classified information, and 
raises questions about Applicant's trustworthiness, and his willingness and ability to properly safeguard classified information.  Directive, &para; E2.A11.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is mitigating where the violation was inadvertent (&para; E2.A11.1.3.1) or where it was an isolated event (&para; E2.A11.1.3.2).  Both mitigating factors are present in 
this case.  Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his negligent mishandling of this classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 4.b of the SOR alleges Applicant failed to comply with security regulations by having Top Secret messages in his bunk aboard ship during sleep 
periods.  Applicant indicated his duties required him to have daily access to classified, and that it was permissible to possess Top Secret material anywhere on 
the ship while deployed.  In the absence of any information countering this representation, I find the substantial evidence is insufficient to indicate Applicant 
violated applicable security regulations by having classified material in his sleeping area on board ship. </SPAN></P>
