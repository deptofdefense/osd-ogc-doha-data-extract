</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 2, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review</EM> <EM>Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR).  That SOR detailed why, pursuant to 
Guideline B (Foreign Influence), it could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  In his response, dated May 12, 2005, Applicant admitted to four of the allegations contained in the SOR 
while denying the remaining three allegations.  Additionally, he requested an administrative determination based on the submissions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's case was submitted on June 6, 2005, and a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="03-00270.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> was provided to him.  Applicant received 
a copy of the FORM on June 20, 2005, and was afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit evidence in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  On 
June 28, 2005, Applicant submitted a five page Rebuttal Brief with one attachment item, Applicant's 1999 Standard Form 86. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> I was assigned this case on

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has admitted to four of the seven allegations set forth in the SOR.<A HREF="03-00270.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the 
following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 66-years old and has served his current employer, a defense contractor, since December 1999.  He was born and raised in geographic China, well 
prior to its current political organization as the People's Republic of China.  After receiving his Bachelor of Science degree in Hong Kong, Applicant conducted 
his graduate study in Canada.  There, he earned a Master of Science degree and, in 1967, a Doctor of Philosophy degree.  The following year, he and his wife, a 
fellow Chinese &eacute;migr&eacute;, married in the United States.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 17, 1973, Applicant became a naturalized United States citizen.  Professionally, Applicant has served the defense industry and held a secret 
clearance since approximately 1983; from 1986 to 1993, he held a top secret clearance.  Domestically, he and his family have lived in the same home since 
1985.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although the first in his family to emigrate to North America from China, his brothers eventually followed.  His elder brother and his wife are United States 
immigrants with children living and working in the U.S. and Canada.  His younger brother and his family, presently living in Hong Kong, are Canadian citizens.  
With the family's patriarch deceased, Applicant's 88-year-old mother is his last connection to China.  He and his brothers collectively contribute some financial 
support to supplement her pension.<A HREF="03-00270.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Recognizing that she will not be emigrating from China, Applicant notes that he has, consequentially, "reduced his 
Chinese connections to the minimum."<A HREF="03-00270.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Of what that "minimum" consists beyond financial support is left undefined by Applicant, although he does note that 
he has not physically visited China since 1957. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1998, Applicant's wife accepted a challenging job offer from a private parochial university located in Hong Kong.  This position included an 80% salary 
increase and generous travel allowances, as well as the opportunity to reformulate and build a significant university resource from the ground up.  During her 
tenure at that university, she worked 10-hour-plus days and returned home about every six weeks, either at university or personal expense.<A HREF="03-00270.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  As part of her travel 
allowance package, and as part of her contract as an employee of foreign residence, Applicant could be flown into Hong Kong up to twice a year; between 
arch 1999 and October 2004, Applicant thus visited his wife and brother at least five times.  Applicant also visited Taiwan, as a tourist, in April 2001.  At 
some point in the past couple of years, however, Applicant's wife finished her project at the Hong Kong university, returned home, and has since become a 
senior consultant with her home state's college and university system. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has had a clean record with regard to his handling of classified materials.  Moreover, all the factors regarding his family have long been documented 
and known, and his foreign travel has been conducted with appropriate caution.  Applicant submits that this current scrutiny is the result of external factors 
beyond his control, specifically as the result of the Chinese publication of Zhongwen and Zongxiao's <EM>Source and Technique in Obtaining National Defense 
Science and Technology Intelligence.  </EM>That source notes that China gathers intelligence from open literature and from experts, especially ethnic Chinese 
experts, working in the United States.  Applicant argues that this resource was purposefully published by the Chinese to "drive a wedge and to create difficult 
situations for many ethnic Chinese Americans working in the U.S. defense industry,"<A HREF="03-00270.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> including individuals such as himself.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, these adjudicative guidelines are subdivided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or 
revoke one's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to determine one 
could still be eligible for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In application, an Administrative Judge is not strictly bound to the adjudicative guidelines. As guidelines, they are but part of an amalgam of elements for the 
Administrative Judge to consider in assessing an applicant in light of the circumstances giving rise to the SOR, as well as in assessing the applicant as a whole.  
The concept of the "whole person" means that all available, reliable information about the person - whether it is good or bad, present or past - should be 
considered in making a fair, impartial, and meaningful decision as to his or her suitability to hold a security clearance.  To that end, Enclosure 2 also sets forth 
factors to be considered during this part of the adjudicative process, including: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individuals age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a full and thorough examination, however, the final assessment must comport with the considerable gravity of the final decision.  There is no right to a 
security clearance,<A HREF="03-00270.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and one seeking access to classified information must be prepared to enter into a fiduciary relationship with the United States Government 
that is inherently predicated on trust and confidence.  Therefore, when the facts proven by the Government raise doubts as to an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has the heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-00270.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  
Therefore, any doubts will be resolved in favor of the national security, not the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Finally, it must be noted that Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 
specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Therefore, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based it, in whole or in part, on any express or 
implied determination as to this Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN>. </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom 
he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or 
financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG><A HREF="03-00270.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline, are set forth and discussed below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I find the following with respect to the 
allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline B (Foreign Influence), the Government has established its case.  Applicant admits that he provides financial support to his mother, 
and that she is both a citizen and resident of the People's Republic of China.  Moreover, Applicant admits that one brother, a Canadian citizen, is also a resident 
of Hong Kong.  The citizenship and residency of these family members raise security concerns with regard to Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI 
DC) E2.A2.1.2.1 ([<EM>a</EM>]<EM>n immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or 
present in, a foreign country</EM>). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When, as here, the Government's initial burden has been met and a disqualifying condition raised, the burden shifts to the Applicant to go forward with 
evidence in rebuttal, explanation, or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As a threshold issue, Applicant has explained, and the Government acknowledged in its reply to his response to the SOR, that the first of the 7 allegations 
contained in the SOR is no longer correct.  With regard to allegation 1.a ("Your spouse is a citizen of the United States and a resident of Hong Kong. She 
returns to the United States approximately every six weeks") and, consequentially, 1.g ("Your wife's employer ... has paid your travel expenses to visit your 
wife in Hong Kong ... (and) will pay these expenses up to twice a year."), Applicant's wife is a resident of the United States; she specifically left her work in 
Hong Kong to rejoin her family in the United States and to assume a senior position with her home state's extensive public college and university system 
sometime in the recent past.  Therefore, I find subparagraph 1.a and 1.g no longer represent disqualifying conditions and, concomitantly, I find those 
subparagraphs in Applicant's favor.  With regard to allegation 1.c ("Your brother is a citizen and resident of Hong Kong"), Applicant also has shown that this 
brother, while a resident of Hong Kong, is a citizen of Canada.  Therefore, to the limited extent that subparagraph 1.c alleges that Applicant's brother is a 
citizen of Hong Kong, I find in favor of Applicant.<A HREF="03-00270.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Finally, because Applicant's one pleasure trip to Taiwan does not represent a disqualifying connection, nor 
add weight to any of the remaining disqualifying conditions, I find subparagraph 1.f in Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With regard to Applicant's mother and his younger brother, of Chinese and Hong Kong citizenry, respectively, Applicant has offered little personal information.  
Specifically, he has neither directly stated, nor provided facts upon which I can find, that neither is an agent of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited 
by a foreign power in a way that could force him to choose loyalty between these relations and the United States.  Indeed, the scant information Applicant has 
offered with regard to these relations raises more questions than it settles.  For example, Applicant provides no facts as to his mother except that she is an aged 
widow who receives a pension and supplemental income from her sons.  He implies, however, that the paucity of her pension is the result of past persecution 
and present mistreatment by China,<A HREF="03-00270.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> without giving any details about past acts of persecution or showing how current treatment is lacking in some fashion.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Moreover, as noted, <EM>infra</EM>, the risk posed by Hong Kong is considerably lower than that posed by China.  This does not, however, excuse Applicant for his 
failure to offer any information as to his brother, his employment, or his relationship to the government of Hong Kong .  With such questions left unanswered, 
Applicant has failed to establish that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1 ([<EM>a</EM>] <EM>determination that the family member(s), (spouse, 
father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sons), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a 
foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States</EM>) applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also has failed to present mitigating evidence regarding, or a full description of, the nature and extent of his relationship with his mother and brother.  
With regard to his mother, he has presented argument that except for his financial support of her, he has otherwise "reduced his Chinese connections to a 
minimum."<A HREF="03-00270.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  He has failed, however, to define what that minimum is or otherwise detail the extent of his contact, if any, with his mother.  Regarding his 
brother, there is no indication as to whether their relationship is intimate or casual.  All that he has offered is that they jointly contribute to their mother's 
financial well-being and that they visited somewhat regularly, at least five times in Hong Kong, between 1999 and 2004.<A HREF="03-00270.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Based on the minimal evidence 
proffered, mitigation under FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3 ([<EM>c</EM>]<EM>ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent</EM>) cannot be applied.  No other 
mitigating circumstance applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This assessment cannot be complete without addressing the countries at issue.  The People's Republic of China is a communist regime with well documented 
abuses of human rights, and the National Counterintelligence Center lists China as one of the most active collectors of foreign economic information and 
industrial espionage.<A HREF="03-00270.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Notwithstanding Applicant's theory that the specter of foreign information gathering by China is the result of a China-borne rumor, 
perpetuated to stimulate suspicion of Chinese academics, the argument and exhibits proffered by the Government, here, outweigh Applicant's theory with 
regard to the security concern and potential risk that this country poses.  Hong Kong, on the other hand, may be a Special Administrative Region of China, but it 
is also one of the world's most open and dynamic economies.<A HREF="03-00270.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  It is noted as a free and open society where human rights are respected, courts are independent, 
and there is a well-established respect for the rule of law.<A HREF="03-00270.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Indeed, it is of additional note that the Government offers no evidence indicating any sinister Hong 
Kong intentions or activities, such as industrial espionage or active collection of foreign economic information, directed toward the United States.  In contrast to 
China, therefore, the risk posed by Hong Kong is comparatively low.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered both the record evidence and the Applicant in light of the "whole person" concept.  Applicant is a mature, highly educated professional whose 
security issues emerged late in his career.  His answers demonstrate candor and his years of service demonstrate a dedication to this country that is as 
impressive as his wife's dedication to the groves of academe.  Although Applicant has shown himself to be a man of character and integrity, that does not 
preclude the Government from considering whether his facts and circumstances pose a security risk.<A HREF="03-00270.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By failing to better flesh out his descriptions of his 
mother and younger brother and his relationships with them in such a way as to mitigate concerns, Applicant has failed to carry his burden and assuage the 
doubts they raise.  Further, because </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">any doubts <EM>must</EM> be resolved in favor of the national security, not the Applicant, I find against Applicant with regard to the 
allegations set forth at paragraph 1, subparagraphs 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and, to the extent it relates to his brother's residency in Hong Kong, subparagraph 1.c of the 
SOR.  Consequentially, I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
