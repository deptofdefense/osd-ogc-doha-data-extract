</P>

<P>	On August 12, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated
January 2, 1992, issued the attached Statement of Reasons (SOR) to                                 (Applicant),
which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine
whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</P>

<P>	The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 3, 1996, and requested to have
his case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the
Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on March 3, 1997.  The Applicant
was instructed to submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt. 
The Applicant received the Government's written case on March 8, 1997, and submitted an
additional statement.  The case was received by the undersigned for resolution on April 9, 1997.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Applicant is 47 and single.  He is employed by a defense contractor and he seeks to
obtain a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</P>

<P>	The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, based
upon the allegations set forth in the attached Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings
of fact are entered as to each paragraph and criterion in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's
Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the live testimony.</P>

<P><U>Paragraph 1 (Criterion N - Drug involvement).</U>  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the
Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs and has been involved in illegal
drug activity.  </P>

<P>	The Applicant began using marijuana in approximately 1973.  He used it primarily on a
weekly basis.  The Applicant also purchased marijuana during the period he was using it.  The
Applicant stopped using marijuana in 1988 and expresses a credible intent not to use marijuana in
the future.  (Government Exhibit 10 at page 1.)</P>

<P>	In September 1992, the Applicant was arrested, along with other people, for (1) Conspiracy
to Possess a Controlled Substance Base (Cocaine) and (2) Possession of a Controlled Substance for
Sale (Cocaine), both state felonies.<A HREF="96-0460.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  As a result of a plea bargain, the Applicant plead nolo
contendere to Count (2) on March 22, 1993, and received a sentence which includes five years
probation, 365 days in jail, and pay probation fees of about $2,300.  As of the date the record closed
the Applicant continued to be on probation.  The Applicant states that he only plead guilty because
the person who was the real dealer declined to accept personal responsibility and threatened to harm
the Applicant's two adult daughters.  (Government Exhibits 9 and 10.)  On the other hand, the same
exhibits and the Probation Officer's Report (Government Exhibit 6), shows that the Applicant, who
was the record owner of the house where the events took place, was at least tacitly involved in the
incidents.<A HREF="96-0460.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  Based on my evaluation of the available evidence, I find that the Applicant was in
possession of cocaine base in the period of September 1992.  I also find that, while he may not have
been directly involved in the conspiracy to possess cocaine for sale, the Applicant could have and
should have known that drug activity was taking place from his house.  His failure to do anything
about it shows extremely poor judgment on his part.</P>

<P>	The Applicant consistently denies, in his Answer and two sworn statements, that he used
cocaine in the period 1991 through 1992.  (Applicant's Answer, Government Exhibits 9 and 11.) 
The only evidence that he used cocaine is found on page 5 of Government Exhibit 6, the Probation
Officer's Report.  As stated above, that report is incomplete and unsigned.  Under the particular
circumstances of this case, I find that the Government has not met its burden in proving that the
Applicant has used cocaine as alleged in the Statement of Reasons.   </P>

<P><U>Paragraph 2 (Criterion E - Questionable judgment).</U>  The Government alleges in this paragraph that
the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of his
personal background during the clearance screening process. </P>

<P>	On November 21, 1995, the Applicant completed an official DoD questionnaire in which he
stated that he had never used or purchased marijuana or cocaine.  (Government Exhibit 7, questions
22.a. and 22.b.)  The statements regarding marijuana were false answers to material questions
pertaining to the Applicant's former involvement with illegal substances.  As stated above, the
Government failed to meet its burden regarding whether the Applicant used cocaine.</P>

<P>	The Applicant was subsequently interviewed by a Special Agent of the Defense Investigative
Service (DIS) April 4, 1996.  In that first interview the Applicant discussed his drug related arrest
and also stated, "I have never been involved in any use, sales, trafficking, manufacturing or
distribution of any type of illegal drug or controlled substances."  (Government Exhibit 9 at page 2.) 
The Applicant was reinterviewed on May 7, 1996, and admitted his marijuana use.  He was evidently
not asked about cocaine in this interview.  (Government Exhibit 10.)  In a subsequent interview on
November 8, 1996, the Applicant once again categorically denied any cocaine use.  He further stated
that he had no idea how the statements regarding cocaine use came to be in Government Exhibit 6. 
(Government Exhibit 11.)</P>

<P>	The Applicant stated that he had  falsified his drug information, "(B)ecause I was afraid of
not being granted a security clearance which is a requirement for being recalled back to work." 
(Government Exhibit 10 at page 1.) </P>

<P><U>Paragraph 3 (Criterion J - Criminal activity).</U>  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the
Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal acts.</P>

<P>	As found above, the Applicant plead nolo contendere to, and was found guilty of, a state
felony, Possession of Cocaine Base for Sale.  </P>

<P>	As found above, the Applicant knowingly and willfully provided false material information
to DoD during the clearance screening process.  In so doing the Applicant violated the felony
criminal provisions of 18 USC 1001.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of
Defense, in Enclosure 2 and Section F.3. of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which
must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors
should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the factors are
neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the
Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law,
human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security
clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these
factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the
Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</P>

<P><CENTER><U>Criterion H (Drug involvement)</U></CENTER>
</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could raise a security concern</U>:</P>

<P>	(1)	any drug abuse;</P>

<P>	(2)	illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale
or distribution.</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</U>:</P>

<P>	(1)	the drug involvement was not recent;</P>

<P>	(3)	a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.</P>

<P><CENTER><U>Criterion E (Personal conduct)</U></CENTER>
</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could raise a security concern</U>:</P>

<P>	(2)	the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts
from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to
conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine
security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</P>

<P>	(3)	deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and
material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official
representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination;</P>

<P>	(4)	personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's
vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or pressure;</P>

<P>	(5)	a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</U>:</P>

<P>	(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</P>

<P><CENTER><U>Criterion J (Criminal conduct)</U></CENTER>
</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could raise a security concern</U>:</P>

<P>	(1)	any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</P>

<P>	(2)	a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</U>:</P>

<P>	(1)	the criminal behavior was not recent;</P>

<P>	(2)	the crime was an isolated incident;</P>

<P><A NAME="Criterion H"></A><A NAME="Criterion F"></A><A NAME="Criterion E"></A><A NAME="Criterion J"></A>	In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at page 2-1, "In evaluating the
relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following
factors (General Factors):</P>

<P>		a.	The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</P>

<P>		b.	The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P>

<P>		c.	The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<P>		d.	The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<P>		e.	The voluntariness of participation</P>

<P>		f.	The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent
behavior changes</P>

<P>		g.	The motivation for the conduct</P>

<P>		h.	The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P>

<P>		i.	The likelihood of continuation or recurrence."	</P>

<P>	The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and
conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is "clearly consistent with
the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</P>

<P>	In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian
workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day. 
The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an
Applicant for clearance may be involved in acts of drug abuse, falsification and criminal conduct,
that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</P>

<P>	The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense
determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable
and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and
motivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,
voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the
future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a
reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or
conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized
by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order...shall be
a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the
loyalty of the applicant concerned."</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding
of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the granting of a security
clearance.  If such a <EM>prima facie</EM> case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant
to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome
or outweigh the Government's <EM>prima facie </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of
persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a
security clearance.</P>

<P>	In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by <EM>prima facie</EM> evidence that
the Applicant has used illegal drugs and been involved in drug related criminal activity (Criteria H
and J); and that he intentionally made false material statements to DoD, in violation of a felony
criminal statute (Criteria E and J).</P>

<P>	The Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal,
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's <EM>prima facie</EM> case against
him, except in part.  Under Paragraph 1 (Criterion H), as set forth above, subparagraph 1.a. is found
for the Applicant as the Government did not prove that the Applicant used cocaine.  Subparagraph
2.c. (Criterion E) is found for the Applicant as the Government failed to prove that the Applicant
falsified that particular statement, based on my factual finding regarding subparagraph 1.a.</P>

<P>	Applicant's marijuana use ended approximately nine years ago.  He expresses a credible
intention not to use marijuana in the future. Accordingly, subparagraphs 1.c. and 1.d. will be found
for the Applicant.</P>

<P>	The Applicant's involvement in the drug operation out of a house he owns cannot, however,
be mitigated at the present time.  Looked at in the best light for the Applicant, he was incredibly
naive and allowed his roommate to run a drug operation out of his house.  At its worst, there is
evidence in the record that the Applicant knew about the drug operation and may have been a part
of it.  (Government Exhibit 6 at page 8.)  In addition, there is the fact that the Applicant remains on
probation as of the date the record closed.  Accordingly, subparagraph 1.b. and Paragraph 1
(Criterion H) must be found against the Applicant, as well as subparagraph 3.a.</P>

<P>	The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders, and it
is a negative factor for security clearance purposes where an Applicant has deliberately provided
false information about material aspects of his or her personal background.  Under the particular
facts of this case, the eight year gap between the end of his marijuana use and his falsification cannot
be used as a mitigating factor.  Criteria E and J are found against the Applicant.</P>

<P>	The Applicant's efforts at reform are noted, and he is commended for his decision to refrain
from further drug use.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, this evidence does not
overcome the adverse information that has been presented by the Government.</P>

<P>	On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's
information opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a
finding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2 and
3 of the Government's Statement of Reasons. </P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by
Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</P>

<P>		Paragraph 1:	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>			Subparagraph 1.a.:	For the Applicant.</P>

<P>			Subparagraph 1.b.:	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>			Subparagraph 1.c.:	For the Applicant.</P>

<P>			Subparagraph 1.d.:	For the Applicant.</P>

<P>		Paragraph 2:	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>			Subparagraph 2.a.:	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>			Subparagraph 2.b.:	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>			Subparagraph 2.c.:	For the Applicant.</P>

<P>		Paragraph 3:	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>			Subparagraph 3.a.:	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>			Subparagraph 3.b.:	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>DECISION</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</P>
