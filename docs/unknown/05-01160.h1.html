<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains four allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline H, Drug Involvement.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all four 
allegations.  His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant, who is 24 years old and single, is employed as a mechanical engineer by a defense contractor.  He graduated from college in August 2003. (Item 1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began using marijuana in high school.  He attended high school from September 1996 to June 1999. (Item 4.)  During his high school years, he 
smoked marijuana regularly with friends approximately 50 times.  From January 1999 to at least August 2003, while he was a college student, Applicant 
purchased marijuana for his own use and the use of his companions.  He used marijuana during his college years approximately 950 times.  He also ingested 
brownies laced with marijuana approximately once.  On a ski trip with friends in February 2002, he used cocaine once.  He used marijuana in September 2003, 
after finishing college.  (Item 1.)  He has witnessed others using cocaine several times.  (Item 6.)  Applicant stays in contact with companions with whom he 
used illegal drugs. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> (Item 6)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF-86) on October 30, 2003.  In response to Question 27 on the SF-86, he admitted his use of illegal 
drugs and the frequency of his illegal use. (Items 4 and 5.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 18, 2004, Applicant was interviewed by a special investigator for the U.S. Office of Personal Management.  (Item 6.)  He identified his drug use 
with his life as a college student.  He denied being dependent on marijuana and said it had no effect on his studies, work, or personal relationships.  He denied 
seeking treatment, counseling or rehabilitation for his drug use.  (Item 6.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant stated an intention not to use marijuana or cocaine in the future.  He has continued to associate with individuals who use illegal drugs. (Item 6.)</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>&sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H, Drug Involvement</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency and at times daily, from approximately January 1999 to at 
least September 2003 (&para; 1.a.); that he purchased marijuana from about September 1999 to at least August 2003 (&para; 1.b.); that he used cocaine in approximately 
February 2002 (&para; 1.c.); and that he continued to associate with individuals who use marijuana and/or cocaine (&para; 1.d.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's concern with Guideline H conduct is that it raises questions regarding an individual's ability or willingness to protect classified information.  
Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, thereby increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.  &para; 
E2.A8.1.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Drugs are defined under Guideline H as mood and behavior-altering substances, including drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed 
in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, and inhalants and other similar substances. &para;&para; E2.A8.1.1.2., E2.A8.1.1.2.1., E2.A8.1.1.2.2.  Drug abuse 
is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.  &para; E2.A8.1.1.3.  Marijuana, or cannabis, and cocaine 
are identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, as controlled substances.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Through Applicant's own admissions, the Government established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case that he  purchased and used marijuana frequently, including daily, for 
over 4 &frac12; years between January 1999 and September 2003; that he used cocaine once in February 2002; and that he continues to associate with individuals who 
use marijuana and/or cocaine.  Applicant has admitted Guideline H drug involvement specified in the SOR and identified as disqualifying under &para;&para; E2.A8.1.2.1. 
and E2.A8.1.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record shows that Applicant's involvement with marijuana began in high school and continued throughout his college years.  By his own estimate, 
Applicant used marijuana approximately 50 times in high school and approximately 950 times in college.  He ingested marijuana in brownies once and used 
cocaine once.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant stated his last drug use occurred in September 2003, approximately two years ago. Thus, his drug involvement was not recent, and, accordingly, 
mitigating condition E2.A8.1.3.1. applies.  However, Applicant's marijuana use was intensive and spanned  a period of approximately five to six years of his 
adolescence and young adulthood.  Thus, his drug involvement was neither isolated nor aberrational and represented a consistent and long-standing lifestyle 
choice.  Therefore, mitigating condition E2.A8.1.3.2. does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant asserted in his signed, sworn statement of August 18, 2004, that he did not intend to use marijuana or cocaine in the future.  (Item 6.)  He also stated 
he did not think his use of marijuana affected his personality or responsibilities as a student, friend, family member, or worker, suggesting he was unaware of or 
ignored the fact that illegal involvement with drugs raises legitimate questions about an individual's willingness or ability to obey the law and to protect 
classified information.  Additionally, Applicant provided no plan or rationale for relinquishing his habit of drug use, and he stated he continued to associate 
with people who use marijuana and cocaine.  Absent some clear demonstration of how he planned to abstain for marijuana and cocaine use, his assurances that 
he will not use drugs in the future lack credibility, and thus mitigating condition E2.A8.1.3.3 is inapplicable.  Accordingly, the allegations in the SOR of 
disqualifying conduct under Guideline H are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
