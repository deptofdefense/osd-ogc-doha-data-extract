<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This 48-year-old systems programmer was arrested and convicted of possession of heroin for sale in 1975 and again in 1976, when he was 20 and 21 years old.  
He was sentenced to more than one year imprisonment on the second matter, <EM>and</EM> for violation of probation on the first matter.  He has not had any criminal 
problems for the last 27 years, has led a productive personal and family life, and has a solid work history, including possession of a DoD Security Clearance 
since 1992, with no problems.  Adequate mitigation has been established under Criminal Conduct Guideline J.  However, as to SOR 1.c., which cites 10 U.S.C. 
986, Applicant's two convictions and sentences (SOR 1.a. and 1.b.) preclude me from granting or renewing his security clearance.  Clearance is denied. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 28, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied 
or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 22, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made after a hearing before a DOHA 
Administrative Judge.  The matter was assigned to another Administrative Judge, but was reassigned to me on June 24, 2003, because of caseload 
considerations.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 8, 2003, setting the hearing for August 26, 2003.  At the hearing, the Government did not call any 
witnesses, but offered six exhibits, which were marked for identification and admitted as Government Exhibits (GX) 1-6.  The Applicant testified, and offered 
three exhibits, which were marked and admitted as Applicant's Exhibits (AX) A-C.  At Applicant's request, the record was kept open after the hearing to allow 
her to obtain and submit additional documentation.  Applicant timely submitted a package of 19 additional documents, which have been marked and admitted 
as AX D1-D19.  The transcript (Tr) was received at DOHA on September 8, 2003.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 48-year-old systems engineer for a defense contractor and has been employed by this company since 1995.  He has held a DoD security clearance 
since 1992.  The SOR contains three allegations under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits the factual allegations 
1.a. and 1.b., which refer to arrests and convictions in 1975 and 1976, respectively.  These admissions are incorporated herein and are considered as Findings of 
Fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering the totality of the evidence derived from the contents of the case file, I make the following additional FINDINGS OF FACT as to each SOR 
allegation:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. - Applicant was arrested in January 1975 and charged with Possession of Heroin  and Possession of Heroin for Sale.  He was sentenced to, and served, four 
month's incarceration in a county jail.  He paid a fine of $500.00, and a surcharge of $50.00.  No sentence of any additional incarceration was imposed at the 
time; it was suspended for a period of four years.  During that time, Applicant would be on probation, during which he was to comply with the court's other 
conditions, including that he be a law-abiding citizen. (GX 1 at page 56, 111).  In 1976, Applicant was again arrested and convicted for the same type of offense 
(alleged in 1.b.), as a result of which he was found to be in violation of probation from his 1975 conviction, and was sentenced to three to five years 
imprisonment, to run concurrent with the sentence for his 1976 conviction. (GX 2 at 126-130).  He actually served about two years. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b. - Applicant was arrested in June 1976, and charged with Possession of Heroin and Possession of Heroin for Sale.  He was found guilty and was sentenced 
to a period of incarceration of from three to five years.  His release date was July 1978 (GX 2 at 129-132).  He actually served about two years (Tr at 21). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c. - The convictions and sentences to more than one year, cited in SOR 1.a. and 1.b., above, disqualify the Applicant from holding a security clearance, except 
that the Secretary of Defense may grant an exemption in a meritorious case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Governor of his state issued a Proclamation of Pardon to Applicant on June 18, 1986.  The Proclamation noted Applicant had "led an exemplary life in his 
community, and has fulfilled the responsibilities of a law-abiding citizen since 1978." (GX 3 and AX A).  Applicant received a B.S. in Computer Engineering 
in 1991 (AX B).  The security officer of Applicant's company has worked with Applicant for eight years and views him as a conscientious, dedicated and 
completely trustworthy individual, who has demonstrated exemplary conduct (AX C). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The 18 post hearing documents submitted by Applicant are either letters of recommendation or performance appraisals covering 1998-2003.  All 18 documents 
contain highly positive information about Applicant and are given considerable weight.  In his previous application for a DoD security clearance in 1992, 
Applicant did cite and discuss the 1975 and 1976 arrests and convictions. (Tr at 45). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has never sought to hide the mistakes of his youth.  The official records show that Applicant took responsibility for his actions (GX 1 and 2 and TR at 
17).  He has been married for 22 years, has two children and three grandchildren.  His wife has a serious medical problem, which requires a great deal of 
attention from Applicant. (Tr at 18).  He began his work career as a laborer,  discovered a talent for technical drawing, and worked his way up to his present 
position after going back to school for additional training and a degree in computer engineering at the age of 36. (Tr at 33).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and 
maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; 
(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence 
(Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2). I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, I find the following specific adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>GUIDELINE J</STRONG> (Criminal Conduct) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise security concerns and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. Any criminal conduct . . . ;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. the criminal behavior was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. The crime was an isolated incident;<A HREF="02-17623.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">5. There is clear evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Other Policy Considerations </EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">10 U.S.C. 986 precludes the granting or continuation of a DoD security clearance for anyone convicted of a crime and sentenced to more than one year 
imprisonment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6 identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to 
the ultimate question of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance. In reaching the fair and 
impartial overall common sense determination based on the Directive's "whole person" concept, I am not permitted to speculate, but can only draw those 
inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must 
make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">If the Government meets its initial burden of proof and establishes conduct that creates security concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then 
shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within 
specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based upon trust and confidence. As required by 
DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended, </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">at E2.2.2., "any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of national security will be resolved in favor of the 
nation's security."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS </SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 48-year-old man, naturalized as a six-year-old child in 1961, after being adopted abroad.  His parent were/are native borne Americans, as are his 
wife and children.  He was raised and educated here and graduated from college in 1991.  He has been with his present employer since 1995 and has held a 
DoD security clearance since 1992. He appears to have had no other security-significant problems, legal, alcohol, drug, financial, or otherwise.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The fact of Applicant's two arrests and convictions, as alleged in SOR 1.a. and 1.b., are undisputed, and are otherwise established by the record evidence.  They 
occurred when he was 20 and 21 years old.  All drug activity is serious and possessing drugs for sale to others is even more serious, even though the amounts 
involved in the present case are not large.  Applicant's explanations to the court in 1975 and 1976 suggest a level of emotional immaturity and a denial of risks 
and consequences that is not uncommon in someone of his age at the time.  Clearly he did not learn the right lessons from his first arrest and conviction, in 
1975, since he went out and did it again, with the help of an equally immature friend.  Just as clearly, however, he appears to have drawn the right conclusions 
from second arrest, conviction, and incarceration.  (Tr at 20-23).  Twenty seven years have passed since 1976, and it is hard to discern the troubled youth he was 
then from the husband, father, valued employee, and holder of a security clearance for 10 years that he has become.  The number of positive statements and 
evaluations submitted on his behalf make a strong case for the premise that Applicant became a man of considerable integrity and good judgment and has been 
so for many years. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considered  under the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) relating to Criminal Conduct, I conclude that while DC 1 and 2 are 
applicable, their current security significance is minimal because of the passage of so long a period of 27/28 years, without any recurrence of similar or other 
misconduct (MC 1); the once repeated misconduct is not a single act, but is isolated in the sense of its not having recurred in a life of 48 years (MC 2) and; 
finally, clear evidence of successful rehabilitation over a long and current period, as shown not only by the time that has elapsed, but by what he had done with 
his life, particularly as shown by the credible and consistent statements of others (MC 5).  Overall, I conclude that the risk of recurrence is minimal.  In the 
absence of other policy considerations, and considering the record evidence under both the specific Disqualifying and Mitigating Conditions and the general 
guidelines applicable in all cases, allegations 1.a and 1.b. would have been decided in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, there remains the  issue of the applicability of 10 U.S.C. 986(1), as alleged in SOR 1.c.  That statute applies to convictions and sentences such as 
those imposed on Applicant.  Consequently, I conclude that 10 U.S.C. 986(1) is controlling and mandates a finding that Applicant is ineligible to hold a security 
clearance.  I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986. </SPAN></P>
