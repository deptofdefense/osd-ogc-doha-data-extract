<P>Applicant's possession,  use, and renewal of a foreign passport after becoming a U.S. citizen demonstrated a foreign preference and was not mitigated where 
Applicant had neither surrendered the passport nor obtained formal approval for its use. However, the record did not support allegations that Applicant falsified 
his clearance application. Clearance denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 21 July 2004 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">denial or revocation of 
his clearance because of foreign preference and personal conduct.<A HREF="03-04615.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant answered the SOR on 30 July 2004 and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the 
case to me 19 November 2004 and I convened a hearing on 24 January 2005. DOHA received the transcript 2 February 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the SOR allegations under Guideline C. He also admitted the falsification allegations under Guideline E, but denied any intent to mislead 
the government. Accordingly I incorporate those admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 49-year-old consultant for a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He has not previously held a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Egypt in 1955, deriving Lebanese citizenship from his parents, who later moved back to Lebanon. He immigrated to the U.S. in 1973 to 
pursue his education and escape the escalating violence in Lebanon. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in February 1984. He obtained his first U.S. passport 
in 1984 and renewed it in 1994. He considers himself a U.S. citizen and pledges allegiance to the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1993, Applicant had his expired Lebanese passport revalidated at the Lebanese Embassy in order to travel to Lebanon, in violation of the travel ban imposed 
by the U.S. Department of State in 1987. When Applicant arrived in Lebanon, Lebanese officials advised him that his passport had not been properly 
revalidated by the embassy and he was issued a new passport. Applicant was not sure of the expiration date of the new passport (GE 2, Tr. 82), but provided 
documentation that suggests that it was valid for either one or five years (AE D). In his November 2002 sworn statement (GE 2) he stated that it might be valid 
until 2003. He also stated that he did not intend to renew the passport and would be willing to surrender it, except that his ex-wife has had it in her possession 
since February 2001. The travel ban to Lebanon was lifted in 1994 (AE C), replaced by a travel advisory that continues in effect.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the mid-to-late 1990s, Applicant traveled extensively to the United Kingdom (U.K.)  and other countries in Europe on company projects. Initially, he 
was working out of his company office in the U.S. and traveled to Europe at company expense, including airfare and reimbursement for travel expenses. In 
1998, the company assigned Applicant to its U.K. office as a cost-saving measure. The company would not be paying to have Applicant travel from the U.S., 
would not be paying travel expenses for Applicant while he was in the U.K., and would only be paying for his business travel from the U.K. to other locations 
in Europe. However, Applicant's salary would continue to be paid in dollars, but would become taxable by the U.K. government.<A HREF="03-04615.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> To ameliorate this, the 
company entered into a "tax equilization" agreement whereby the company would make Applicant whole for any additional income taxes occasioned by his 
residing in the U.K. (AE A, B).  Applicant resided in the U.K. from approximately March 1998 to July 1999. Some of this time he resided in hotels or housing 
leased in the company's name. He also resided in an apartment leased in his name for about six months. He derived no tangible benefits from his residence in 
the U.K. Any tangible benefits accrued to his company.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant completed his clearance application in August 2002, he did not disclose his residence in the U.K. or his renewed Lebanese passport in 1993. 
However, he did disclose his foreign birth, dual citizenship with Lebanon, and extensive foreign travel. He did not disclose his residence in the U.K. because he 
considered himself--consistent with the tax agreement he had with his company--a resident in the U.S. He did not disclose his foreign passport because he did 
not have possession of it and believed it might have expired before the seven-year window asked for in the clearance application.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has stated a willingness to renounce his Lebanese citizenship (GE 1, 2), but has experienced difficulty doing so because he is unable to produce his 
Lebanese passport as proof of his Lebanese citizenship (GE 2). Relying on advice given to him by a DOHA security specialist, he sent an 8 June 2004 letter to 
the Embassy of Lebanon "renouncing my Lebanese citizenship for the purpose of employment on projects for the U.S. government." (GE 3). Although he 
insisted he was not trying to renounce his Lebanese citizenship solely to obtain his clearance, he made conflicting statements on this point (Tr. 74-77).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's character reference considers him an honest and trustworthy individual, and also confirmed Applicant's description of his regular business travel to 
Europe in the 1990s.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 16 August 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I) issued a memorandum<A HREF="03-04615.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> to clarify the 
application of Guideline C, Foreign Preference, to cases involving possession and/or use of a foreign passport. In pertinent part, the ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I memorandum 
<STRONG>"requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the 
appropriate agency of the United States Government."</STRONG>(Emphasis added).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="03-04615.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established its Guideline C case by demonstrating that Applicant renewed and used a Lebanese passport in 1993 to travel to Lebanon in 
violation of the State Department travel ban then in effect for U.S. citizens. This conduct implicates disqualifying conditions (DC) 1 and 2.<A HREF="03-04615.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant meets only one of the mitigating conditions (MC) for foreign preference. MC 4 applies  because Applicant has expressed a willingness to renounce 
his foreign citizenship. The fact that he cannot do so without first proving his Lebanese citizenship does not stop Applicant from receiving the benefit of this 
C. However none of the other MCs apply. MC 1 does not apply because Applicant's dual citizenship is not based solely on his parents' citizenship or his birth 
in Egypt, but is based on his active exercise of dual citizenship after his naturalization. MC 2 does not apply because all indicators of possible dual citizenship 
have occurred since Applicant obtained U.S. citizenship. MC 3 does not apply because Applicant's conduct has not been sanctioned by the U.S., particularly 
where the conduct occurred to deliberately skirt travel limitations on U.S. citizens.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I Memorandum controls the resolution of the foreign preference issue. The memorandum provides that Applicant's past possession and use of his 
foreign passport can be mitigated only if Applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains U.S. Government approval for its use. Applicant has undertaken 
neither action. Further, the Appeal Board has ruled that possession of an expired passport does not satisfy the Money Memo requirement for surrender of the 
passport. <EM>See, </EM>DISCR Case No. 01-24306, September 30, 2003.<EM> </EM>I resolve Guideline C against Applicant.<EM><A HREF="03-04615.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> </EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government did not establish its Guideline E case with regard to Applicant's omission of his foreign passport, as the record evidence does not clearly show 
that Applicant's passport had been valid within the seven years preceding his August 2002 clearance application. In any event, Applicant lacked the intent to 
mislead the government on this point, given his extensive disclosure of his other foreign connections. While the government did establish a Guideline E case 
with regard to Applicant's residence in the U.K., Applicant lacked the intent to mislead the government because he considered his residence there no different 
than his regular business travel to the U.K., business travel that he freely disclosed on his clearance application. I resolve Guideline B for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
