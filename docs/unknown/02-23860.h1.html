<P>Applicant mitigated security concerns over foreign influence. His wife and one sibling became naturalized citizens of the U.S. and reside in the U.S.  His 
brother is a permanent resident of the U.S. since July 2001 and resides in the U.S.  While Applicant represented a U.S. company in Taiwan, those business 
contacts ceased when he left their employ in 2000.  His elderly relatives in  Taiwan (Republic of China) have no ties to the government.  He has not visited 
there since 1998. It is improbable that foreign pressure on these relatives would create a situation that could influence Applicant as he persuasively attests that 
his preference and loyalty is exclusively for the U.S. since he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 2000.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-23860.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> to the Applicant on October 20, 2003.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why the Government could not find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified information.  The SOR alleges specific 
concerns over foreign influence (Guideline B) in paragraph 1. Applicant replied to the SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on November 8, 2003, where he 
denied 1.a. and admitted 1.b, 1.c., and 1.d.  He requested a decision without a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel who prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 14, 2004, which was forwarded to Applicant.  He 
received it on April 30, 2004, and submitted a response dated May 24, 2004, within the thirty day deadline outlined in the transmittal letter. (Exhibit A) On June 
3, 2004,Department Counsel indicated she did not object to Exhibit A.  On June 8, 2004, the case was assigned to me.  </P> 
<P>The Government offered for Administrative Notice four documents:  a U.S. Department of State list of Independent States in the World (Exhibits 5), a 
Background Note: Taiwan (Exhibit 6), The Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage from 2000 (Exhibit 7), and a 
case from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit: <STRONG><EM>U.S. v.  Yang</EM></STRONG>, 281 F.3rd 534 (6<SUP>th</SUP> Cir. 2002)  (Exhibit 8).  Applicant objected to the consideration of 
the <STRONG><EM>Yang</EM></STRONG> case (Exhibit 8) as a racial profiling example.  (Exhibit A)  </P> 
<P>While I have considered all four documents, I can give little weight to Exhibit 8 as there is nothing submitted by Department Counsel to provide a link between 
the facts of the <STRONG><EM>Yang</EM></STRONG> case and the material facts of this Applicant.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional Findings of 
Fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant, a 41-year-old employee, began working for a defense contractor (Employer #1) in State #1 in July 2001.  In August 2001 he completed a Security 
Clearance Application (Standard Form 86).  (Exhibit 4) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant did graduate work at a university in State #1 and completed an MS in May 1992. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 2000 and was issued a 
U.S. passport in July 2000. (Exhibit 4)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant married in May 1996 in the U.S., and his wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen in October 2003 and resides in the U.S.  His sister became a 
naturalized U.S. citizen in December 1999 and resides in the U.S.   His brother is a permanent resident of the U.S. since July 2001 and current resides in the 
U.S.  (Exhibit 4; Answer) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant completed the SF 86 forms, he disclosed that his parents and parents-in-law are citizens of the Republic of China and reside there.  He visited 
there in 1994 through1998 for business and pleasure.   (Exhibit 4)    His trips were primarily to take care of his elderly parents.  His mother-in-law died in 1997.  
His parents and father-in law are both elderly, retired, and have no ties to the government.  Applicant's father is 70; he had a tea business and was self-employed until he retired in 2000.  His mother is 71 and a housewife.  His father-in-law is 75 and retired from being a custom broker for 40 years. They are 
financially self-sufficient; indeed, they are eager to become permanent residents of the United States and eventually citizens.  (Exhibit A) Given these facts, I 
conclude it is unlikely they would be exploited by  the government in Taiwan </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to his parents </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and 
his father-in law and his loyalty to the United States.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From May 1995 to May 1998 and again from August 1999 to February 2000, Applicant worked for a commercial U.S. company that conducted a product 
export business.  He had five business trips to represent his employer for business purposes and has had no subsequent contact with these clients since 2000 
when he stopped working for that employer.  Indeed he has not traveled to Taiwan since February 1998.  (Exhibit A)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Taiwan which is an independent multiparty democratic government with formal diplomatic relations with 27 countries and a close 
diplomatic and commercial relationship with the U.S. since the end of World War II.  When Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2000, he solemnly 
took the oath of allegiance to the United States.  He attests he will not be pressured or influenced by any foreign power or by foreign relatives.  (Exhibit A)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a 
consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>B - Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>The concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2)  may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the 
potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial 
interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or 
pressure.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. Relatives, cohabitants, or associates who are connected with any foreign government;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.      A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question 
are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant mitigated the Government's security concerns over possible foreign influence raised by Applicant's close ties of affection to his wife and siblings, his 
elderly parents and father-in-law, his travel to Taiwan from 1995-1998, and his work for a U.S. company where he was a consultant on developing business 
opportunities in Taiwan.   He overcame the security concern under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, that a security risk may exist when an individual's 
immediate family. . . and other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States, (3) or have 
relatives who are connected with any foreign government who may be subject to duress.  While I have considered these concerns and the documents submitted 
for administrative notice, I conclude Applicant has presented evidence to meet the burden these circumstances present.  These security concerns are mitigated 
by several facts:  Applicant's wife in October 2003 because a naturalize citizen of the U.S. and resides in the U.S.  His sister became a naturalized citizen of the 
U.S. in 1999 and resides in the U.S.  His brother in July 2001 became a permanent resident of the U.S. and is waiting to meet the eligibility requirements to be 
naturalized (five years as a permanent resident).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, Applicant's only family ties to Taiwan are his elderly relatives with whom he has limited contact; he has not visited Taiwan since February 1998. 
Thus, any risk of foreign duress or influence on Applicant and/or his immediate family would appear to be slight and clearly manageable.  Thus, I find  there is 
no substantial likelihood that he would be subject to duress merely because of these family ties as they are financially self-sufficient and have no ties to the 
government.  It is unlikely they or he could be exploited by  the government in Taiwan </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to his 
parents </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and his father-in law and his loyalty to the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While he traveled to Taiwan on business and made business contacts for a U.S. company, that travel by itself to a U.S. commercial ally does not raise a security 
concern.  Further, his business contacts in Taiwan on behalf of a U.S. company ceased when he left their employ in 2000. Contacts with citizens of other 
countries are relevant to security determinations only if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure through threats 
against those foreign relatives.  After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I conclude these ties are not of such a 
nature as to create any tangible risks of undue pressure on Applicant, so foreign influence security concerns are mitigated.  Thus, I resolve SOR paragraph 1 and 
subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d. in Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process 
section, I make the following formal findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1. Guideline B     FOR APPLICANT</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
