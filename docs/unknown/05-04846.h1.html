<P>Applicant failed to mitigate his history of not meeting financial obligations. Though he mentioned a divorce in 1998 and reduced employment earnings as 
reasons for his indebtedness, he provided no specific information on how these events impacted his financial responsibility to pay his bills six years later. He 
has also failed to explain how his reduced income prevented him from at least contacting the creditors to negotiate some kind of settlement or repayment plan. 
In addition, Applicant's inconsistent and contradictory explanations for his "no" answers in the security application (SCA) convince me he deliberately omitted 
material information on the form. His deliberate dishonesty under the personal conduct guideline also represents criminal conduct under Guideline J. Clearance 
is denied. </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>STATEMENT OF CASE</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On October 12, 2005, under Executive 
Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5200.6, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the reasons for its security concerns raised 
under the financial considerations guideline (Guideline F), the personal conduct guideline (Guideline E), and the criminal conduct guideline (Guideline J) of the 
Directive. In his answer dated November 5, 2005, Applicant requested a decision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. A copy of the Government's File 
of Relevant Material (FORM, the Government's evidence in support of the SOR) was sent to Applicant on May 19, 2006. Applicant received the FORM on 
ay 25, 2006. Applicant's  response to the FORM dated May 26, 2006, was received by DOHA on June 5, 2006. The case was assigned to me for decision on 
June 9, 2006.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant admitted seven of the eight financial allegations except for subparagraph 1.b. He admitted both allegations under the personal conduct guideline. 
Applicant is 58 years old and employed as a security guard by a defense contractor. He seeks a secret clearance.</P> 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG>. On January 20, 2005, Applicant provided information (sworn statement, Item 5) concerning  the debts listed under paragraph 1 of 
the SOR. Applicant opened a credit card account with the first creditor (1.a.) in 1996; his last payment on the account was in October 1998.<A HREF="05-04846.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The account was 
transferred to a collection agency, and, as of August 2005 (a current credit bureau report) Applicant owes $3,702.00. </P> 
<P>Subparagraph 1.b. identifies a delinquent debt of $90.00 for flowers. Applicant denies he owes the debt and has formally disputed the account (Item 7) as noted 
in one of the credit bureau reports. Subparagraph 1.b. is found in Applicant's favor. </P> 
<P>Applicant obtained the credit card (1.c.) in December 1995 and made his last payment on the card in June 2000. As of August 2005, Applicant owes $2,447.00 
on this joint revolving account. </P> 
<P>Applicant recalled receiving the credit card (1.d.) in 1998 and making $200.00 in payments. With the interest that has been accruing since February 2001, 
Applicant owes $1,295.00 on the account.</P> 
<P>The debt identified in 1.e. of the SOR represents a past due medical bill ($75.00). Applicant's insurance company did not pay for services rendered. No 
additional explanation was provided. </P> 
<P>Applicant owes a collection agency $1,847.00 (1.f.) for an account that was transferred for collection in August 2004. Applicant admitted the account is his, but 
provided no other details. </P> 
<P>Applicant attached a personal financial statement (PFS) to his January 2005-sworn statement. In that PFS (1.g.), Applicant indicated he had a $70.00 monthly 
remainder after payment of his bills and expenses. He claims he was using the remainder to help his sister pay for some of his mother's nursing home costs. No 
additional information was provided. The PFS shows that Applicant was not making any payments on his delinquent debts (1.a. through 1.f.). </P> 
<P>Applicant accused his wife of running up the credit card charges after their divorce in October 1998. Applicant also said, "I overextended my budget and 
became in debt more than I could afford, through my own fault." (Item 5) Applicant also did not know when he would be in position to repay the debt because 
he does not make much money. </P> 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG>. Applicant executed a security clearance application (SCA) on July 14, 2004. In response to question 38, asking about debts in the last 7 
years more than 180 days delinquent, Applicant answered "no." In response to question 39, asking information about debts more than 90 days delinquent, 
Applicant also answered "no." Applicant admitted the "no" answers to both questions but stated, </P> 
<P>I didn't realize I was 180 days delinquent at the time I put no down on the initial clearance paperwork by mistake. It was not done deliberately, I knew I owed 
money due to my ex wives charges on credit cards. It was on a mistake on how many days and that is all. (Supplemental answer to SOR, received by DOHA 
November 5, 2005)</P> 
<P>The most important characteristic about the debts is that they are five to six years overdue. Each one of the accounts indicates Applicant has singular or joint 
liability. Even though his former wife charged up each account at the end of their marriage, he still has full responsibility for each account in his name.</P> 
<P>Applicant provided five observations for his current financial status. First, he is a veteran of foreign wars and had never experienced any bankruptcies, 
garnishments, or repossessions of any kind. Second, his wife is to blame for using all the credit in each of the cards. When his wife used up the credit cards, 
Applicant had less money available to pay bills for his parents who were in senior citizen homes. Third, Applicant reiterated his intention of repaying his 
overdue creditors. Fourth, Applicant paid off his bank loan and the florist account. Fifth, Applicant concludes his security clearance should be reinstated so he 
can work at this job and serve the country. </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth guidelines containing disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given binding 
consideration in making security clearance determinations. These conditions must be considered in every case along with the general factors of the whole 
person concept. However, the conditions are not automatically determinative of the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's 
reliance on his own common sense. </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) "[T]he 
Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security 
suitability." ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). </P> 
<P>Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>See Egan</EM>, 481 U.S. at 531; <EM>see</EM> Directive E2.2.2.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG> (FC). An individual who is financially overextended (not able to pay their bills as they become due) is at risk of engaging in illegal 
acts to generate funds. The circumstances of this case raise security concerns under FC disqualifying condition (DC) E2.A6.1.2.1.(<EM>a history of not meeting 
financial obligations</EM>) as Applicant has collected more than $9,456.00 in overdue debt to six creditors or collection agencies. The 1.a., 1.b. and 1.c. debts have 
been delinquent by more than 180 days before the date Applicant executed his SCA in July 2004. Applicant's inability to pay also triggers FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. 
(<EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy creditors</EM>).</P> 
<P>Conditions that may mitigate security concerns associated with overdue indebtedness includes FC mitigating condition (MC) E2.A6.1.3.1. (<EM>the behavior was 
not recent</EM>) and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2. (<EM>it was an isolated incident</EM>). Neither of these conditions apply as the debt in 1.f. </P> 
<P>became delinquent less than two years ago, and, except for the florist debt, Applicant has taken no action to repay the other creditors. </P> 
<P>FC MC E2.A61.3.3. (<EM>the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control</EM>) may mitigate or extenuate when unforeseen events 
emerge to prevent a person from paying their bills. Applicant's three reasons for having $9,456.00 in delinquent debt are: (1) his former wife created large 
credit card debt after their divorce in 1998, (2) Applicant's jobs since his divorce have paid less than $20,000.00; and, (3) he took on more debt than he could 
afford. </P> 
<P>Applicant's first reason is not probative because he has provided no detail of how his former wife misused his credit cards. The only detail of the delinquent 
debts comes from the credit bureau reports that show he is responsible for the five creditors. The fact that he has only been able to get employment at lower 
paying jobs since 1998 is not mitigating. Reaping lower earnings means that Applicant does not have the resources to pay off some of the larger debt but it does 
not stop him from at least confronting his creditors with his tight budget circumstances, and negotiating his debt through settlement or establishing a repayment 
plan. In sum, Applicant's divorce in 1998 and unexplained assistance for his mother's nursing home expense, entitles him to very little mitigation under FC MC 
E2.A61.3.3.</P> 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (<EM>the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications the problem is being resolved or is 
under control</EM>) does not apply under the facts of this case as there is no evidence of counseling, and no plan as to how he intends to repay these creditors. 
Without a plan, there is no credible basis to believe the debts are under control. With neither a plan nor evidence to demonstrate Applicant has repaid or even 
contacted any of the creditors (except for the creditor in 1.b.), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6.(<EM>the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts</EM>) does not apply. Considering the third reason acknowledging fault for taking on more debt than he could handle, I find against 
Applicant under subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.c. through 1.f. Subparagraph 1.g. (that has also been found against Applicant) provides additional evidence showing 
Applicant has made no attempt to repay the creditors, even the medical debt of $75.00 (1.e.).</P> 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG> (PC). Applicant admits he answered "no" to both SCA questions, but denied he entered the negative answer deliberately. Rather, he claims 
he was confused about the number of days that passed between when the debts became delinquent and when he executed his SCA. Having weighed and 
balanced the date of his divorce (May 1998) with his belief his former wife increased his credit card debt after the divorce, and the date he executed the SCA 
(July 2004), I have difficulty believing his claim of confusion over the amount of time that passed between 1998 and July 2004. Due primarily to (1) the 
passage of six years between his divorce and his execution of the SCA, and (2) his age (54) when he executed the SCA, Applicant's claim of confusion is not 
persuasive, and, I find against him under 2.a. and 2.b.</P> 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG> (CC). Applicant's conduct under the PC guideline also represents CC conduct under Guideline J as CC DC E2.A10.1.2.1. (<EM>allegations or 
admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>). When Applicant deliberately falsified his SCA in July 2004, he also 
intentionally omitted material information from a government form used by the government to ascertain security suitability. The omitted information was 
clearly material in that it could have changed the direction of the government investigation. Because the intentional falsification occurred in July 2004, CC MC 
E2.A10.1.3.1. (<EM>the criminal behavior was not recent</EM>) and CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2. (<EM>the crime was an isolated incident</EM>) are not applicable as the falsification 
occurred less than two years ago. Although the falsification occurred only once, the recency of the falsification rules out the application of CC MC 
E2.A10.1.3.2. CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6. (<EM>there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>) generally applies when the record shows substantial steps taken by an 
applicant to improve his financial situation or purge himself of the criminal conduct. Applicant's continuing denial of deliberately omitting material information 
from his SCA eliminates CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6. from favorable consideration. I find against Applicant under both guidelines. My adverse findings have also 
included an evaluation of these facts under the whole person concept of the Directive. Though Applicant has said he will pay the past due debt, his failure to 
take any action for the past six years demonstrates his financial problems will persist in the future. </P>
