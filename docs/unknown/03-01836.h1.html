<P>Applicant, born in the People's Republic of China (PRC),  became a United States citizen in 1999.  His mother and father, citizens and residents of  PRC, are in 
the process of moving to the United States.  His wife is a citizen of PRC, residing in the United States, and is becoming a United States citizen. None of these 
family members belong to, participate in, or are active with any government agency of PRC.  They are not in a position to be exploited by PRC in a way that 
could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to these family members and his loyalty to the United States.  Applicant's strong attachment to the United 
States and minimal ties to PRC makes it unlikely that he would respond favorably to any efforts to persuade him to act against United States interests.  
itigation has been shown. Clearance is granted.   </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated November 
6, 2003, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct 
proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, or denied.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant<EM></EM> filed a notarized response dated December 8, 2003, to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative 
Judge. On April 15, 2004, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing, and pursuant to formal notice dated June 7, 2004, a hearing was held on July 1, 
2004. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1- 7) and no witnesses were called. Applicant  offered nine 
documentary exhibits (Exhibits A-I) and offered his own testimony and that of three other witness. The transcript (TR) was received on July 22, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>The SOR was based on foreign influence (Guideline B) concerns because of the foreign residency and/or citizenship of close family members and foreign 
preference (Guideline C) related to his exercise of dual citizenship with the United States and PRC.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The SOR contains four allegations, 1.a., through </SPAN>1.d.,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under 
Guideline B, and one allegation, 2.a. under Guideline C. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with the exception of 1.d</SPAN>., with some explanations,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
which will be discussed in this decision. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testimony of 
Applicant and the additional witness, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 41 years old. He is employed as a Senior Software Engineer by a United States defense contractor that wants him to have a security clearance. He 
received two Masters degrees, in Physics and Materials Engineering, in 1990 and 1992, respectively, from two United States universities.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has immediate family members or people to whom he may be 
bound by affection or obligation, who are not citizens of the United States, or may be subject to duress.    </P> 
 
<P>Applicant was born in PRC. He came to the United States in 1988. He became a <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> naturalized </SPAN>United States citizen in 2000. Applicant is married to a woman, 
who was born in PRC. She now resides in the United States and is in the process of becoming a naturalized United States citizen. Applicant and his wife have a 
four year old son who was born in the United States and is a United States citizen. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents are PRC </SPAN> citizens and residents.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Both of them are retired and in poor health. His father was a teacher and his mother was an accountant, and 
neither of them ever worked for or had any affiliation with the PRC Government. In March 2004, Applicant applied for green cards for his parents to come to 
this country, because he wanted to remove any concern the United States Government may have of a potential threat if they remain in PRC. He plans for his 
parents to live with him when they arrive in the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents-in-law are citizens of PRC, but reside in the United States with Applicant.  Applicant's sister-in-law also  resides in the United States </SPAN>and is 
married to a United States citizen.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's wife formerly sent money to her parents, but she no longer does that since they live with her and Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has some relatives, who are citizens of and reside in PRC.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He has not spoken to them for many years. </SPAN>He is not aware that any of these family 
members belong to, or are active with, any government agency of PRC. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since Applicant </SPAN>came to the United States in 1988, he has <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">traveled to PRC one time, in 1994, to visit his family. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> doses not anticipate receiving any inheritance or other financial interest from PRC.  He has estimated his financial holdings in this country to be 
worth two hundred thousand dollars </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> had three individuals testify for him. They indicated that they believed he was trustworthy and reliable. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for another 
country over the United States. The Government was concerned because, as of December 6, 2002, Applicant possessed a PRC passport, which is not scheduled 
to expire until October 25, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Since that date, Applicant instructed his parents, who maintained custody of the passport, to return it to the Facility Security Officer of his company. On 
February 23, 2004, the security officer returned the passport to PRC Consulate General, indicating that Applicant, as a citizen of the United States, no longer 
desired to keep the passport (Exhibits D and E).           </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN> considered<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN>The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2).</SPAN>  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </P> 
 
<P>the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I 
conclude the following with respect to guidelines B and C:<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of </SPAN>Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence) <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN>Applicant's parents <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">are citizens and residents of</SPAN> PRC. The PRC citizenship and residency of Applicant's family create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. 
The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet 
his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for him.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>  The evidence of existence of <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">immediate family members</SPAN>, who are citizens of and reside in PRC comes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1, 
immediate family members, or  persons to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, who are citizens of, or resident in, a foreign country.  
The fact that the foreign country in question is PRC, a country under Communist rule,  is also a concern; but that fact is not automatically controlling. </P> 
 
<P>Based on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence, including: the lack of PRC government involvement of Applicant's parents, currently 
and in the past, the fact that his wife and in-laws now live in the United States and plan to remain here, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">his devotion to his son,</SPAN> his  history since coming to the 
United States,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and his strong feelings concerning this country,</SPAN>  I have determined that his wife and his parents in PRC do not constitute an unacceptable security 
risk, and Mitigating Conditions (MC) E2.A2.1.3.1., a determination that the immediate family members. . . in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a 
position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States, 
applies. </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>         After considering all of the evidence of record on this issue, I conclude that the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the 
SOR and even in the unlikely event pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would resist it, and would  report the 
incident to the proper authorities. </P> 
 
<P>Guideline C is based on actions taken by an individual that indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States. Applicant's decision to retain his 
PRC passport raises foreign preference (Guideline C) concerns. At the time the SOR was issued, DC E2.A3.1.2.1., the exercise of dual citizenship could be 
argued to apply because he retained his PRC passport, and DC E2.A3.1.2.2., possession and/or use of a foreign passport applied. I conclude that since Applicant 
never used his passport, once he became a United States citizen,  he never actually exercised foreign citizenship and DC E2.A3.1.2.1. does not apply.  Since 
Applicant revoked his PRC passport, neither the Money Memorandum nor DC E2.A3.1.2.2 now applies in this case.</P>
