<P>Applicant has a history of financial delinquency that he has not yet addressed. With his income barely sufficient to cover his family's living expenses and his 
spouse mismanaging her income, Applicant is not in a position to repay some $4,157 in delinquent consumer credit debt placed for collection or charged off 
due to nonpayment. Embarrassed about his poor credit, Applicant deliberately did not disclose any of his debts when he completed his security clearance 
application in June 2000. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On June 9, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="02-23074.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> DOHA recommended referral to an administrative judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should 
be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The SOR was based on Financial Considerations (Guideline F) and on Personal Conduct (Guideline E).</P> 
 
<P>On July 2, 2003, Applicant filed his response to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge. The case was assigned to me 
on August 12, 2003, and pursuant to formal notice dated August 18, 2003, a hearing was scheduled for September 17, 2003. At the hearing held as scheduled, 
six Government exhibits were entered into the record and testimony was taken from the Applicant. A transcript of the proceedings was received by DOHA 
September 29, 2003.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The SOR alleged financial considerations due to unresolved delinquencies totaling $4,157.42  when he reported a net monthly remainder of $1,831.00, and 
personal conduct concerns related to his failure to disclose on a June 2000 security clearance application debts that were over 180 days delinquent and tax liens 
filed within the last seven years. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted owing the debts alleged, but denied deliberate falsification of his security 
clearance application. After a thorough review of the evidence, and on due consideration of the same, I render the following findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 41-year-old technical worker in advanced materials, who has been employed by a defense contractor since May 1989. He seeks to retain his 
security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Due to mismanagement of his personal finances, Applicant was about $10,000 in debt when he married in August 1988. With a settlement his spouse received 
from an automobile accident, Applicant and his spouse managed to pay off the debt. In August 1994, they purchased a residence by taking out a mortgage. 
Sometime in 1995, Applicant's spouse had to stop working because of a difficult pregnancy. They managed to remain current in their mortgage obligation, but a 
credit card account on which they had an outstanding balance of $840 (SOR subparagraph 1.a.) was charged off to profit and loss in June 1996. Another credit 
card account, opened with a retail department store in August 1994, and used for household items, was written off in May 1997 in the amount of $634.42 (SOR 
subparagraph 1.d.).</P> 
 
<P>Following the birth of their daughter in January 1996, Applicant's spouse did not return to work. Applicant had difficulty meeting their financial obligations on 
his salary,<A HREF="02-23074.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and in June 1996, the city filed a tax lien against Applicant in the amount of $1,756 for nonpayment of local real estate taxes. In November 1996, 
Applicant and his spouse refinanced their mortgage, taking out a loan in the principal amount of $97,174.65 with a new lender. His back taxes were paid in the 
refinancing, and the tax lien for $1,756 was released that December. Yet another tax lien was issued against him in May 1997 in the amount of $1,816. That lien 
was released in September 1997. By January 1998, Applicant and his spouse were in default of their mortgage loan. In late April 1998, they settled the debt by 
conveying the property by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. A tax lien filed against Applicant in June 1998 in the amount of $1,979 was released the following 
month.<A HREF="02-23074.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In September 1998, Applicant and his spouse opened a revolving charge account with a clothing-retailer on which they ran up a $599 balance (SOR 
subparagraph 1.b.). Three months later, the debt was written off to profit and loss with neither Applicant nor his spouse having made any payments. An account 
opened in May 1998 in the amount of $16,905 became past due in the amount of $1,088 and was placed for collection. Applicant has made no payment on the 
debt since October 1999 (SOR subparagraph 1.f.).<A HREF="02-23074.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A><!--I'm not sure this footnote is necessary.--></P> 
 
<P>On June 27, 2000, Applicant executed a security clearance application, EPSQ version (SF 86). He responded negatively to inquiries concerning his financial 
record, including whether in the last seven years he had any property repossessed  (question 35), any tax liens (question 36), any debts delinquent more than 180 
days (question 38). He also answered "NO" to question 39 regarding whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s). Embarrassed by his 
financial situation, Applicant deliberately did not disclose that his residence had been taken by deed -in-lieu of foreclosure due to default on his mortgage loan; 
that tax liens had been filed for nonpayment of local property taxes; and that at least three accounts were in collection or had been charged off due to 
nonpayment.<A HREF="02-23074.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Sometime in 2001, Applicant's spouse returned to work on a part-time basis. In March 2001, a credit card account with a $250 limit was opened with Applicant 
listed as an authorized user. They fell behind in their payments in late 2002, and a $436 balance was charged off in March 2003 when the account fell 
delinquent more than sixty days for the third time (SOR subparagraph 1.e.).</P> 
 
<P>In December 2001, Applicant and his spouse bought a new home, secured by a mortgage loan of $137,700. With his spouse working less than 20 hours per 
week at minimum wage jobs, he withdrew funds from his 401K to purchase the home. As of March 2003, the account was delinquent  ninety days, past due in 
the amount of $5,148. He managed to bring the account current by September 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant opened a credit card account in January 2002. The account was rated current as of March 2002 with a balance of $191, but he could not keep up with 
his payments. As of January 2003, he had a delinquent balance of $560 which he has made no effort to repay (SOR subparagraph 1.c.).</P> 
 
<P>On April 24, 2002, Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) about his financial situation and failure to disclose 
financial delinquencies on his security clearance application. Applicant admitted owing $840 on a credit card (SOR subparagraph 1.a.) and expressed an intent 
to contact the creditor to arrange for repayment. He denied any liability for his former residence following the surrender of the home through deed-in-lieu of 
foreclosure and contested the validity of other debts reported on his credit report, including the $600 plus debt owed on a credit account with a nationwide 
retailer (SOR subparagraph 1.d.), and the $599 owed on a retail clothing-store account (SOR subparagraph 1.b.). Regarding the tax liens listed on his credit 
report, Applicant expressed his understanding he was responsible only for the liens for the 1994 and 1995 tax years, which were paid. Asked by the agent why 
he did not list the delinquencies, mortgage deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or tax liens on his SF 86, Applicant responded he did not think it was important to list 
the information.</P> 
 
<P>On April 24, 2002, Applicant provided the agent with a personal financial statement on which he reported a net monthly remainder of $1,831 using estimated 
figures for his spouse's income based on her former salary. In preparing the financial statement, Applicant failed to account for his actual expenses.</P> 
 
<P>Circa June 2003, Applicant's spouse returned to work full-time. Not aware of the extent of her earnings, Applicant does not count on her income to pay the 
family's financial obligations as she mismanages her money. </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>As of September 2003, Applicant's monthly salary was $3965. He no longer has daycare costs as his youngest child is in second grade. He had not taken any 
steps to resolve his outstanding delinquencies as he has only $5 to $10 per month available after payment of the bills. With his spouse's salary, Applicant 
submits they have sufficient funds to make payments on the delinquent debts, but they have not come to any agreement as to how to handle the debts.<A HREF="02-23074.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 
Applicant has no savings as he used the money for a vacation in August 2003.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination  required.  
Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other 
pertinent behavioral changes; the potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in 
the future. <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enc. 2, Section E2.2.  Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should 
not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. Moreover, although adverse information 
concerning a single guideline may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a 
recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">See</SPAN> Directive, Enc. 2, Section E2.2.4.</P> 
 
<P> Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudicative guidelines are the most pertinent to this case:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Financial Considerations</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>E2.A6.1.1. The Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A6.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</P> 
 
<P>E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A6.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A6.1.3.3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>E2.A5.1.1. The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A5.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to  conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A5.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>None.</P> 
 
<P>Under Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon an affirmative 
finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination required, the 
administrative judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In addition, as the trier 
of fact, the administrative judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Decisions under the Directive include consideration of the 
potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold">Burden of Proof</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets its burden and 
establishes conduct cognizable as a security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, 
extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct raising security concerns, it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue his security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." Any doubt as to whether access 
to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of Applicant, I conclude the 
following with respect to Guidelines F and E:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, the security eligibility of an applicant is placed into question when the applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness, 
recurring financial difficulties, or a history of not meeting his financial obligations. The Government must consider whether individuals granted access to 
classified information are because of financial irresponsibility in a position where they may be more susceptible to mishandling or compromising classified 
information. Applicant has a history of financial difficulties predating his marriage in 1988 and continuing to present. Due largely to financial mismanagement, 
he was $10,000 in debt in the late 1980s, which was satisfied with settlement funds his spouse received from an accident. Applicant managed to remain current 
on his financial obligations until about 1995 when his spouse had to stop working due to a difficult pregnancy. Two credit card accounts were charged off due 
to nonpayment during the 1996/97 time frame, Applicant defaulted on his mortgage, and he did not timely pay his real estate taxes, which led to the imposition 
of tax liens by the municipality. While he settled with the mortgagor by agreeing to deed the property in lieu of foreclosure, and the tax liens have been released, 
he has incurred more than $2,600 in additional credit card debt since 1999 which remains delinquent. Disqualifying conditions</SPAN> E2.A6.1.2.1., a history of not 
meeting financial obligations, and E2.A6.1.2.3., inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts apply in this case.</P> 
 
<P>His spouse's inability to work due to the pregnancy is an unexpected circumstance which negatively impacted their ability to make their credit card, mortgage 
and tax payments during the mid-1990s (<EM>see</EM> mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.3., conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's 
control). Yet, Applicant's financial difficulties are primarily due to financial irresponsibility. Relieved of the burden of the mortgage debt in April 1998, 
Applicant and his spouse continued to extend themselves on credit, opening new accounts when his spouse was unemployed while disregarding older, 
delinquent obligations, and then incurring new debt by failing to make payments on these newer accounts. As recently as October 2002, a credit card debt of 
$436 was charged off to profit and loss. In March 2003, his new mortgage was 90 days past due, although he has since brought the mortgage loan current. 
While Applicant testified to a willingness to resolve his old debts, his actions reflect little commitment in that regard. He spent his savings on a family vacation 
in August 2003 and he has not yet convinced his spouse that they need to work together to satisfy the debts. Although Applicant is not required to be debt free, 
his persistent financial problems preclude me from concluding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified information. 
SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.g.<A HREF="02-23074.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> are resolved against him.</P> 
 
<P>The Government has alleged additional doubts for Applicant's security suitability because of his failure to include on his SF 86 his delinquent debts, including 
his mortgage which he settled by deeding the property in lieu of foreclosure, and the tax liens. When Applicant completed his SF 86 in June 2000, those debts 
alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., and 1.f. were in collection and/or written off to profit and loss due to nonpayment. Applicant had also defaulted 
on the mortgage loan for his previous residence, and tax liens had been issued against him in 1996, 1997 and 1998, apparently for back taxes owed for 1994, 
1995, and 1996. Even though the lender accepted responsibility for the 1996 taxes following seizure of Applicant's home by deed in 1998, Applicant still was 
required to report the lien for nonpayment of taxes on his SF 86.  Applicant admits he did not list his delinquent accounts out of embarrassment.  His omission 
of the liens was also found to have been intentional. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a personnel 
security questionnaire raises serious Personal Conduct concerns under Guideline E (<EM>see</EM> E2.A5.1.2.2.).</P> 
 
<P>While acts of intentional concealment may be mitigated by a prompt rectification before confrontation (<EM>see</EM> E2.A5.1.3.3.), Applicant claimed when he was 
interviewed by the DSS special agent in April 2002 that he thought the information was not important enough to list on his SF 86. It was not until his hearing 
that he admitted he had been too embarrassed to disclose his financial delinquencies on his SF 86. Furthermore, he continues to deny any intentional 
falsification of the tax lien question, while at the same time admitting he knew tax liens had been filed against him. To Applicant's credit, he testified candidly 
about the debts and his failure to make payments on them.  Yet, when the disclosures come, as here, when one is faced with the adverse credit information, they 
are not entitled mitigation under E2.A5.1.3.3. Adverse findings are warranted as to subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b. of the SOR, as he has failed to meet his heavy 
burden to overcome the doubts for his security worthiness caused by his lack of complete candor with the Government.</P>

credit information because he was "quite embarrassed and ashamed." (Tr. 32).  He testified inconsistently as to whether he had known of the tax liens at the 
time he completed the SF 86. Initially, he indicated he was not given any statement from the municipality as to the tax liens. (Tr. 53). He subsequently testified 
when the property was going through foreclosure, all the tax liens were coming up against the house. (Tr. 54). When asked directly by me whether he knew a 
lien had been filed against his property, Applicant responded, "No, I did. I knew they filed a lien." (Tr. 55-56). He then went on to testify in response to 
Department Counsel's questions that he knew he owed taxes but was unaware of the lien (Tr. 56).  After the surrender of the property, Applicant was no longer 
responsible for those taxes for October 1996 and October 1997. But it is clear he knew of the liens. He told the DSS agent in April 2002 that two of the liens 
were for taxes owed for 1994 and 1995. (Ex. 2).

debts." (Tr. 57-58). Applicant subsequently testified he has tried to discuss it with his spouse but was having no success in getting her to see the problem. (Tr. 
59).
