<P>Between 1982 and 1996, Applicant used marijuana five to ten times. In 1988, Applicant--then age 18--was adjudicated guilty of possession of drug 
paraphernalia.  In 1999, he received an Article 15 following a positive urinalysis for marijuana. In 1996, he completed an SF 86 and said he had only used 
marijuana once. The record evidence is sufficient to mitigate or extenuate the negative security implications stemming from his drug usage and false statement. 
Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 21, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="02-09389.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On May 19, 
2003, the Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 5, 2004, the Applicant received a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) dated August 19, 2003, and was given the opportunity to 
file objections and submit material in extenuation, mitigation, or refutation. The Applicant's response to the FORM was due on September 22, 2003. No 
response has been received.  In the FORM, Department Counsel (DC) presented ten exhibits (Items). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant made no submissions. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I was assigned the 
case on March 5, 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the FORM, DC moved to amend the SOR to indicate the location of an Article 15 under the Uniformed Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) from Fort Belvoir 
to Fort Bragg. The motion is granted.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges Drugs, Personal Conduct, and Criminal Conduct.  The Applicant admits to the following: in June 1999, he had a positive urinalysis and 
received punishment under Article 15 UCMJ; he was arrested in March 1988 and found guilty of possession of drug paraphernalia; he used marijuana from 
1982 through 1996; his Army recruiter told him to list only a single use of marijuana. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 34-years-old, has worked for a defense contractor since April 2000, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Applicant was in the U.S. 
Army from January 1997 through March 2000.  Applicant was regarded by those who knew him when he was in the Army as: having an excellent work ethic, 
incredibly hard working, knowledgeable, a dedicated husband, devoted father, and an outstanding soldier. He was promoted ahead of his peers because of his 
outstanding leadership potential. Applicant asserts he is a 60% disable veteran, but has provided no supporting documentation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From 1982 through 1996, Applicant used marijuana five to ten times. In 1988, Applicant--then age 18--and a friend were hitchhiking when the car in which 
they were riding was stopped for speeding. A search of the vehicle revealed cocaine and drug paraphernalia. All individuals were arrested and charged. 
Applicant spent a few days in jail before his release. (Gov Ex 9) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In September 1996, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions, Standard Form (SF) 86. In response to question 24, which asked him 
about his illegal drug usage, he listed a single use of marijuana.  Prior to completing his SF 86, he had been advised by "many military personnel" to limit the 
disclosure of past illegal drug usage. (Gov Ex 5) In his February 2001 sworn statement, Applicant said his recruiter suggested he list only a single usage.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 1999, a random urinalysis of Applicant was positive for the presence of marijuana.  Applicant has consistently asserted he did not knowing use 
marijuana. He received punishment under Article 15 (UCMJ) and was reduced in grade from E-3 to E-1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive.  The government has the burden of proving any 
controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts must have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against 
clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Drug Involvement, Guideline H, The Concern: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to 
protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of 
classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Any drug abuse.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The drug involvement was not recent.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct, Guideline E, the Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal Conduct, Guideline J, the Concern:  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   b. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The criminal behavior was not recent.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." As 
Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for 
access to classified information to "United States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for 
coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Executive Order 12968, 
<EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines 
contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, then the applicant has the ultimate burden of establishing his security suitability with substantial evidence in 
explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  <EM>See </EM>Executive Orders 10865 &sect; 2 and 12968 &sect; 3.1(b). 
"Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." 
Directive &para; E2.2.2 "The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM> See Egan</EM>, 
484 U.S. at 531.  Doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. Under Guideline H, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when that applicant is involved with illegal drugs. From 1982 through 1996, Applicant used marijuana five to ten times, in 1988 he was 
found guilty of possession of drug paraphernalia, and in 1999, and he received punishment under Article 15 (UCMJ) following a urinalysis positive for the 
presence of marijuana. Disqualifying Condition (DC) a.<A HREF="02-09389.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant used marijuana five to ten times over a 14 year period. This is infrequent use.  Applicant, at age 18, was found guilty of possession of drug 
paraphernalia in 1988. Applicant's most recent incident related to illegal drug use was his 1999 Article 15, which occurred five years ago.  Neither this incident 
nor the other drug usage is recent.  Mitigating Condition (MC) a. (The drug involvement was not recent.) applies.  I find for Applicant as to Drug Involvement. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline E, Personal Conduct. Under Guideline E, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when that applicant is shown to have been involved in personal conduct which creates doubt about the person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Complete honesty and candor on the part of applicants for access to classified information is essential to make an accurate and meaningful 
security clearance determination. Without all the relevant and material facts, a clearance decision is susceptible to error, thus jeopardizing the nation's security. 
In September 1996, Applicant completed an SF 86 and listed a single use of marijuana when he had actually used it five to ten times over a 14 year period. 
Because his answer was false, DC 2<A HREF="02-09389.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant said he used marijuana one time when it was actually five to ten times. He followed his recruiter's advice and disclosed a single use on his SF 86. 
The difference in the numbers between the one use he reported and possible ten uses is a distinction without significance.  In any event, Applicant's marijuana 
usage was minor. Applicant's false answer was to a single question on an SF 86 completed almost eight years ago.  MC 2<A HREF="02-09389.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> applies. I find for the Applicant as to 
SOR subparagraphs 2.a.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.  Under Guideline J, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when an applicant is shown to have a history or pattern of criminal activity creating doubt about his judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness.  DC a<A HREF="02-09389.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and b<A HREF="02-09389.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> apply due to Applicant's 1988 conviction of possession of drug paraphernalia, his 1999 Article 15, and his false answer on his 
SF 86. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This conduct is not recent.  The drug paraphernalia possession occurred more than 16 years ago, the false answer occurred almost eight years ago, and the 
Article 15 occurred five years ago.  MC a. (The criminal behavior was not recent.) applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the 
circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P>
