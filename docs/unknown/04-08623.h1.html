<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant was charged with alcohol related offenses on four occasions between 1983 and 2003, the last resulting in a conviction for driving under the influence 
of alcohol on May 27, 2004. He has failed to mitigate the security concerns that arise from his alcohol consumption. Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On October 21, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="04-08623.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline G, concerning alcohol consumption. Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR that was received by 
DOHA on November 5, 2004, requested a hearing, and, while admitting some of the factual allegations made in the SOR, denied any SOR allegation created a 
security concern.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on January 13, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on January 21, 2005, scheduling the hearing for February 4, 2005.<A HREF="04-08623.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled.  The government submitted six documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6, and admitted 
into the record without objection. Applicant testified, called his wife to testify on his behalf, and submitted seven documentary exhibits that were marked as 
Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-7, and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on February 15, 2005.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL MATTERS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to change the date of the arrest alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.d. from "on July 6, 1995" to "on or about July 6, 
1992." Applicant joined in the motion. The motion was granted and the amendment was made on the face of the document. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to facts alleged in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I 
make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 54 years old, and has been married since September 1983. He was previously married in November 1969, and that marriage ended in divorce in 
April 1981. Applicant has three daughters, ages 34, 19, and 17. He graduated from high school in June 1968, and obtained an associate degree in June 1985. 
Applicant  served in the Army Reserve from December 1969 until December 1975. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was employed as a firefighter for 11 years, and as a sales representative for seven years, until he started his own chemical business in February 1988. 
He sold that business in September 1995, and spent the next two years engaged in leisure activities and managing real estate holdings he had acquired. He 
started a trucking business in June 1997 that has grown and evolved into a logistics company employing approximately 120 people in a variety of endeavors 
throughout the southeastern United States. He is the president and 90% shareholder of the company, and is seeking a security clearance so the company can 
perform under Department of Defense contracts. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On March 15, 1983, Applicant went to dinner with his sister and brother-in-law, and consumed what he believed was too much alcohol to permit him to safely 
operate a motor vehicle. Accordingly, his sister drove him home, while his brother-in-law drove Applicant's car. The brother-in-law was stopped at a police 
checkpoint a couple of hundred yards from Applicant's home, and was arrested for driving under the influence. Applicant walked back to the checkpoint to 
determine what had happened to his brother-in-law, and he was then arrested and charged with Drunkenness and Permitting One Drive Vehicle Unlawfully 
[sic].<A HREF="04-08623.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant pled guilty to both charges on June 17, 1983 and was fined $55.00.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI) on December 18, 1984. He testified he had a drink at home with dinner and then went out to 
meet with a customer. He was acquitted of this charge. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was charged with DUI in July 1992. He had consumed alcohol at a retirement party, and, while driving to another city, felt tired, pulled to the side of 
the road, turned off the car, and fell asleep. A police officer found him sleeping in the vehicle and arrested him for the DUI. Although there is no evidence what 
offense he was convicted of, Applicant candidly testified he does recall having to pay a fine of a couple hundred dollars.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was again charged with DUI in December 2003. He had consumed alcohol while playing golf with friends, and was thereafter involved in an 
automobile accident when someone drove into the rear of his car as he was turning into the driveway of his office. He pled guilty in May 2004, and was placed 
on 12 months probation, fined $600.00 plus $140.00 in surcharges, ordered to serve 48 hours in jail, perform 40 hours community service work, and attend an 
alcohol education program. He has successfully completed all terms of probation.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant and his wife both testified he only consumes alcohol on social occasions and occasionally at home. He has never been diagnosed as having an alcohol 
problem, and has not sought any treatment other than in connection with the 2004 conviction. He testified the various penalties imposed as part of the 2004 
conviction were a humbling learning experience for him, and that he will never again consume alcohol and drive a vehicle.    </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline G, 
pertaining to alcohol consumption, with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="04-08623.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-08623.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="04-08623.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="04-08623.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="04-08623.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="04-08623.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-08623.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="04-08623.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="04-08623.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="04-08623.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline G, alcohol consumption is a security concern because excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, 
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. Those who abuse 
alcohol are more likely than others to engage in high risk, thoughtless, and sometimes violent behavior. Recurrent use of alcohol to the point of intoxication 
may affect an individual's ability to exercise the care, judgment, and discretion necessary to protect classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has been charged with alcohol related offenses four times since 1983. He was convicted and required to pay fines in 1983 and 1992, received a much 
harsher sentence following his May 2004 conviction, and remains on probation at present. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Alcohol-related incidents away 
from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Although Applicant's alcohol related offenses span a 20-year time period, they are indicative of a recurring pattern of using alcohol to excess, and thereafter 
engaging in illegal conduct. Applicant was subjected to criminal proceedings in 1983 and 1992 for alcohol related offenses, had fines imposed on each 
occasion, and still chose to drive a car after consuming alcohol as recently as December 2003. Accordingly, Mitigating Condition (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The alcohol related 
incidents do not indicate a pattern</EM> does not apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant testified to the positive effect spending time in jail and attending an alcohol education program has had on him. He has never engaged in binge 
drinking or frequent over consumption of  alcohol. He did not consume any alcohol for eight to ten months after his arrest, but has now resumed drinking in 
social settings and occasionally at home. However, only 14 months have passed since his last arrest, and a mere nine months since his conviction. He is 
scheduled to remain on probation for another three months. Considering the recency of the DUI conviction, and Applicant's resumption of alcohol consumption 
following three alcohol related criminal incidents, albeit spaced over 20 years, MC (3): </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</EM> does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified 
information. Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on 
its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Considering all 
relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, including Applicant's business accomplishments, the factors listed 
in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to overcome the case against 
him and satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline G is 
decided against Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>    </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>
