  A review of the Judge's decision indicates that it lacks any analysis that relates the facts of the case to Mitigating Condition 1 of Guideline B.  There is a paucity of evidence in this case.  In foreign influence cases the nature of the government involved, its intelligence gathering history, and the presence of  terrorist activity are important evidence which provide context for the other evidence of record and must be brought to bear on the Judge's ultimate conclusions.   Favorable decision reversed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On May 24, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons 
advising Applicant of the basis for that decision-security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) pursuant 
to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 25, 2006, after the hearing, 
Administrative Judge Darlene Lokey Anderson granted Applicant's request for<STRONG> </STRONG>a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the 
Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  <STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Guideline B Mitigating Condition E2.A2.1.3.1 
applied to Applicant's case was error; whether the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Guideline B Mitigating Condition E2.A2.1.3.3 applied to Applicant's 
case was error; whether the Administrative Judge erred in not discussing the nature of the Taiwan government and its intelligence gathering posture with 
reference to the United States; and  whether there is sufficient record evidence to support the Administrative Judge's overall favorable security clearance 
determination.  We reverse the Administrative Judge's decision to grant the clearance. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Whether the Record Supports the Judge's Factual Findings</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>A. Facts </P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>The following findings of fact made by the Administrative Judge are pertinent to the issues raised on appeal:<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Applicant was born in Taiwan in 1962 and served in the Taiwanese Army from 1984 to 1986.  He moved to the United States in 1986 on a student visa to 
attend graduate school.  After receiving his doctorate in 1992, he returned to Taiwan because his student visa was no<STRONG> </STRONG>longer valid.  From<STRONG> </STRONG>1993  to 1996 he 
worked as a contractor for the Taiwanese government.  In 1998 Applicant resigned from his job in Taiwan, obtained a job in the United States, and returned 
permanently to the U.S.  In April 2003, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.  The Applicant's mother, mother-in-law and brother-in-law are 
citizens of and reside in Taiwan.  His sister is a citizen and resident of Indonesia.  Applicant's mother and mother-in-law are retired school teachers.  
Applicant's brother-in-law is on disability.  Applicant talks to his mother via telephone on a monthly basis.  He contacts his sister in Indonesia by telephone 
approximately once every three months.  His wife, who is a U.S. citizen, contacts her family in Taiwan every two weeks by telephone.  None of Applicant's 
family in Taiwan or Indonesia are any longer affiliated with the Taiwanese or Indonesian governments.  The Applicant stated unequivocally that if he were ever 
placed in a compromising situation that concerned classified information, under any circumstances he would immediately report the situation to his security 
department.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant traveled to Taiwan in 1997, 2001, and 2003.  He traveled to Indonesia in 2003.  The trips were taken for vacation purposes or to visit family.  
Applicant maintained a small savings account in Taiwan which was closed by his mother in July 2005.  In the United States, Applicant owns his own home 
worth approximately one million dollars.  He also has a 401K and a Roth IRA.  His three children were born in the United States.  A letter of recommendation 
from Applicant's supervisor indicates that Applicant is dependable, motivated, hardworking and trustworthy.</P> 
 
<P>There is other record evidence not made the basis of a finding of fact by the Administrative Judge that nevertheless is pertinent to the issues raised on appeal.  
That evidence is: Taiwan ranks sixth in the ranking of the seven countries most actively engaging in foreign economic intelligence collection and industrial 
espionage against the United States; and (ii) official U.S. government documents report the significant presence of terrorist organizations in Indonesia.</P> 
 
<P>       </P> 
 
<P>      </P> 
 
<P>B. Discussion</P> 
 
<P>The Appeal Board's review of the Administrative Judge's findings of fact is limited to determining if they are supported by substantial record evidence--such 
relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive &para; 
E3.1.32.1.  "This is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not 
prevent an administrative agency's finding from being supported by substantial evidence."  <EM>Consolo </EM>v. <EM>Federal Maritime Comm'n</EM>, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 
(1966).  In evaluating the Administrative Judge's findings, we are required to give deference to the Administrative Judge's credibility determinations.  Directive 
&para; E3.1.32.1. </P> 
 
<P>To the extent necessary to resolve the issues raised on appeal, the Administrative Judge's findings of fact will be discussed below in conjunction with the 
analysis of her ultimate conclusions.</P> 
 
<P>    </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Whether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge's Ultimate Conclusions</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>An Administrative Judge is required to "examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for" the decision, "including a 'rational connection 
between the facts found and the choice made.'" <EM>Motor Vehicle Mfrs</EM>. <EM>Ass'n of the United States v</EM>. <EM>State Farm Mut</EM>. <EM>Auto</EM>. <EM>Ins</EM>. <EM>Co.</EM>, 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) 
(quoting <EM>Burlington Truck Lines</EM>, <EM>Inc</EM>. <EM>v</EM>. <EM>United States</EM>, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge's decision to grant, 
deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive &para; E3.1.32.3. Our scope of review under this standard is narrow 
and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the Administrative Judge.  We may not set aside an Administrative Judge's decision "that is rational, based 
on consideration of the relevant factors, and within the scope of the authority delegated to the agency. . ."  <EM>Motor Vehicle Mfrs</EM>. <EM>Ass'n</EM>, 463 U.S. at 42.  We 
review matters of law <EM>de novo</EM>.</P> 
 
<P>(1) Department Counsel argues that the Administrative Judge committed reversible error by applying Guideline B Mitigating Condition E2.A2.1.3.1<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and 
concluding that Applicant's family in Taiwan are not in a position to be exploited by the Taiwan government and that his sister in Indonesia is not in a position 
to be exploited.  Department Counsel's argument has merit.  A review of the Judge's decision indicates that it lacks any analysis that relates the facts of the case 
to the Mitigating Factor.  The Judge merely states, in conclusory terms without elaboration, that Applicant's relatives in Taiwan, and Applicant's sister in 
Indonesia are not in a position to be exploited.  The Judge does not articulate a rational basis for her conclusion that the mitigating factor applied.  Therefore, 
the Judge's application of the mitigating condition is not sustainable.<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>(2) Department Counsel argues that the record evidence does not support the Judge's conclusion that Applicant's relatives are not agents of a foreign power.  
There is a paucity of evidence in this case.  When the government has established a security concern, as the Judge concluded it had in this case, the burden 
shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate that security concern.  Regarding the application of Guideline B Mitigating Condition 
E2.A2.1.3.1, the Board concludes after a review of the evidence that there was an insufficient basis in the record for the Judge to apply the mitigating factor in 
this case.</P> 
 
<P>(3) Department Counsel argues that the Administrative Judge erred in applying Guideline B Mitigating Factor E2.A2.1.3.3<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and concluding that Applicant's 
contact with his family in Taiwan and Indonesia is casual and infrequent.  This argument also has merit.  There is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant's 
contacts with immediate family members are not casual and that applicant has ties of affection for, or obligations to, his spouse's immediate family members.  
In this case, the evidence indicates that Applicant and his foreign relatives have a positive relationship that includes regular, frequent telephonic contact, and 
occasional face-to-face contact.  This evidence tends to support, rather than rebut, the presumption that Applicant's contacts are not casual, and that he has ties 
of affection for, or obligations to, those family members.  Given the state of the evidence, the Judge failed to articulate a rational basis for her conclusion that 
Applicant's contacts with his foreign relatives are very limited, and are not of a nature to influence his security worthiness.  The Judge's conclusory statement 
that Applicant's contacts with his foreign relatives is very limited and not of a nature to influence his security worthiness is, without elaboration, arbitrary and 
capricious<STRONG>.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>(4) Department Counsel contends that the Administrative Judge erred in not discussing the intelligence gathering posture and past record of the government of 
Taiwan with reference to the United States, and the presence of terrorist threats in Indonesia.  Department Counsel's argument on this point is persuasive.  
Although an Administrative Judge is not required to discuss each and every piece of record evidence in making a decision, the Judge cannot simply ignore, 
disregard, or fail to discuss significant record evidence that a reasonable person could expect to be taken into account in reaching a fair and reasoned decision.  
<EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-19479 at 6 (App. Bd. Jun. 22, 2004)(". . .the Judge's decision cannot simply be silent about what, as a matter of common sense, 
appears to be a relevant factor that could be an important aspect of the case").  In Foreign Influence cases, the nature of the foreign government involved in the 
case, the intelligence gathering history of that government, and the presence of terrorist activity is important evidence that provides context for the other 
evidence of record and must be brought to bear on the Judge's ultimate conclusions in the case.  Here, the Judge's decision is completely silent as to the 
evidence of record regarding Taiwan's history of intelligence gathering and industrial espionage, and terrorist threats in Indonesia.  The Judge's omission 
rendered arbitrary and capricious her evaluation of the significance of Applicant's relatives' citizenship and residency in Taiwan and Indonesia, and her 
evaluation of the applicability of the Guideline B mitigating factors.      </P> 
 
<P>(5) Department Counsel argues that there is insufficient evidence to support the Administrative Judge's overall favorable security clearance decision.  Because 
the Judge erred in her application of Guideline B Mitigating Conditions E2.A2.1.3.1 and E2.A2.1.3.3, and because she erred in not including evidence of the 
security/intelligence profile of Taiwan and Indonesia in her decision, the continued viability of the Judge's ultimate favorable conclusion about Applicant's 
security eligibility under Guideline B rests on whether there is any sustainable basis for her ultimate decision independent of those errors and omissions.  As 
stated earlier in this decision, beyond the establishment of the basic facts that give rise to the government's security concerns (<EM>i.e</EM>., the establishment of the fact 
that Applicant has family ties to citizens and residents of foreign countries), there is a dearth of evidence in this case.  The only other favorable facts cited by 
the Judge are that Applicant has cut all non-family ties with Taiwan and that he understands his responsibility to the United States in holding a security 
clearance. Those facts either do not readily suggest refutation, extenuation, or mitigation of the government's security concerns, or they have low probative 
value.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 04-00109 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 13, 2006); ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 12-13 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005).  Accordingly, the Judge's 
recitation of those facts was not sufficient to support her favorable conclusions under Guideline B.  </P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel has demonstrated several errors below that cannot be corrected by remanding the case, given the record evidence.  Taken cumulatively, 
these errors warrant reversal.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Separate Opinion of Member David M. White</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>I agree with the opinion of my colleagues insofar as they hold that the Administrative Judge's conclusions concerning application of Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence) Mitigating Conditions (hereinafter FIMC) 1<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and 3<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> are arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law, and that this is harmful error.  I disagree with the 
decision to reverse the Judge's decision because correction of these properly identified errors neither mandates nor supports reversal, with the resultant final 
denial of a clearance to this Applicant.  I would remand the case for a properly reasoned and articulated decision, based on consideration of all the relevant and 
material information. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>I. Material Issues Raised on Appeal </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel identified the two issues raised on appeal as follows:</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>A.  Whether the Administrative Judge committed reversible error by applying Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 and concluding that Applicant's family 
in Taiwan (China) are not agents of a foreign power and not in a position to be exploited by the Taiwanese or Chinese governments, and that his sister in 
Indonesia is not in a position to be exploited.</P> 
 
<P>B.  Whether the Administrative Judge committed reversible error by applying Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 3 and concluding that Applicant's contact 
with his family in Taiwan (China) and Indonesia is casual and infrequent.<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P>Whether the Judge erred in not discussing the nature of, and threat presented by, the foreign countries<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> involved was raised by the Government as one of 
several matters in support of its assertion of error with respect to FIMC 1, not as a separate material issue.  That allegation of error implicates not only the 
applicability and weight attributable to FIMC 1, but also the necessary "whole person concept" analysis of, "the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or 
duress."<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>II. Statement of Dispositive Facts</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The majority accurately recites the facts found by the Judge and the additional record evidence relevant to deciding whether her rulings and conclusions with 
respect to FIMC 1 and FIMC 3 were arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law, and constituted harmful error.  The accuracy, as distinguished from the 
completeness, of the Judge's fact finding was not disputed by the Government.<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Additional facts which I consider dispositive of the issues on appeal concern 
the contents of the Judge's written decision itself.</P> 
 
<P>In the "<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG>" section of her decision, the Judge stated, without any analysis or explanation (albeit with ample and self-evident support from her 
findings of fact), that the Government established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, that Guideline B Disqualifying Condition  (FIDC) 1<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> applies to 
Applicant and that his foreign contacts have a direct and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.  The Judge's favorable ruling for 
the Applicant under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) was not appealed.  As the majority correctly points out, the Administrative Judge then recited nothing 
more than analytically unsupported brief and conclusory determinations stating the applicability of FIMC 1 and FIMC 3, engaged in no weighing of potentially 
mitigating versus potentially disqualifying factors,<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and summarily ruled for the Applicant.<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>   </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>III.  Whether the Administrative Judge Committed Harmful Error</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I concur with the majority that the Administrative Judge committed harmful error.  The decision does not set forth her analysis of the relevant facts; nor does it 
explain her rationale for concluding that FIMC 1 and FIMC 3 were proven sufficiently to mitigate her stated security concerns, under FIDC 1, and to therefor 
grant Applicant a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>With respect to both FIMC 1 and any "whole person" analysis, the decision failed to articulate any factual findings or conclusions concerning the nature of the 
foreign countries involved in evaluating potential security risks.  Nor did it explain which circumstances led to the conclusion that neither the family members 
in Taiwan nor those in Indonesia were in a position to be exploited. </P> 
 
<P>With respect to FIMC 3, the decision neither recognized the rebuttable presumption that an applicant's contacts with immediate family members are not 
casual,<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> nor explained which facts were considered to have rebutted this presumption.  There is no explanation why the regular and enumerated  telephone 
contacts and personal visits, most of which are described in the findings of fact,<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> were determined to be, "very limited" and "infrequent". </P> 
 
<P>A decision is held to be erroneous under the arbitrary and capricious standard when, "it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory 
explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made."<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>Taken together, these errors render the Judge's conclusions arbitrary and capricious. These errors were harmful because the Judge's application of the 
mitigating conditions was central to her ultimate determination to grant this Applicant a security clearance after she expressly found that his foreign contacts 
have a direct and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.    In the absence of a rationally articulated basis for the conclusions 
reached by the Judge, I am not in a position to find that either party received the fair process and reasoned judgment required by the Directive.<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>IV.  Whether Reversal or Remand is the Appropriate Remedy</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Directive gives the Appeal Board authority to take one of three actions in its written clearance decision addressing the material issues raised on appeal:  to 
affirm the decision below; to remand the case specifying action to be taken to correct identified error; or to reverse the decision of the Administrative Judge if 
correction of identified error mandates such action.<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  The identified harmful errors that require correction in this case are the arbitrary and capricious 
conclusions applying FIMC1 and FIMC 3 to sufficiently mitigate the security concerns raised by the Government's evidence and warrant granting the clearance 
in question. </P> 
 
<P>Even though this case does not turn on any narrowly defined credibility determinations in the fact-finding process, I am in no position after merely reading a 
cold record to reach my own "fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the 
pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in [the Adjudicative Guidelines]."<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> Applicant is entitled to a hearing and to personally appear before the Judge so 
that the decision maker will be able to assess him as a "whole person" in reaching a proper clearance decision. Both parties to this appeal are entitled to a 
reasoned articulation, by the Judge who heard the evidence, supporting a sustainable judgment.</P> 
 
<P>Under appropriate circumstances, the Judge can "render a favorable decision in the absence of an[y] Adjudicative Guidelines mitigating condition."<A HREF="04-08560.a1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> Thus 
even a finding by this board that FIMC 1 and 3 are not applicable as a matter of law, as opposed to the more narrow legal holding that the decision inadequately 
explains why and how they do apply, would not compel denial of Applicant's clearance.  Only a remand, not a reversal, can cure the arbitrary and capricious 
nature of the decision in this case because the Board is not permitted to conduct a de novo review of the evidence. </P> 
 
<P>Accordingly, I would set aside this decision and remand the case for a new decision by the Judge that sufficiently analyzes and articulates the relevant and 
material information,  the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy, to reach supportable conclusions with respect to both Guideline B and the ultimate 
determination of whether granting a security clearance in this case is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  </P>

<P><A NAME="N_11_">11. </A>The decision is also devoid of any careful weighing of the "whole person concept" as set forth in the Directive &para; E2.2.1.  Many of the nine factors 
enumerated for evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct are not particularly useful in a case, like this one, where the security concerns are not raised 
directly by any improper conduct of the Applicant, but rather by circumstances beyond his control and his otherwise lawful conduct in relation to them.  
Nevertheless the Directive does still require a careful weighing of available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable 
and the circumstances of his particular case in reaching a determination.   For example, the Applicant's connections to the United States, including his own and 
his immediate family's  U.S. citizenship, his substantial financial and real estate holdings and employment history are relevant to the whole person analysis and 
may be balanced against those same factual connections to the foreign countries involved.  Of particular importance in a Guideline B case is analysis of  "the 
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress," &para; E2.2.1.8, presented by the particular circumstances of the Applicant's  foreign connections and the 
nature of the country involved.

itigating Conditions<EM> (1) A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or 
associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose 
between the loyalty of the person(s) involved and the United States </EM>and <EM>(3) Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent</EM> are 
applicable.  Although the Applicant's mother, mother-in-law, and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of Taiwan, none of the individuals are any longer 
associated with the Taiwanese government or in a position to place foreign influence on the Applicant, or in a position to be exploited by the Taiwanese 
Government in a way that could force the Applicant to choose between loyalty to them and loyalty to the United States.  Likewise his sister in Indonesia is not a 
security threat.  Furthermore, the Applicant's contacts with his foreign relatives are very limited, and are not of a nature to influence his security worthiness.  
The Applicant has cut all other ties with Taiwan.  The Applicant understands his responsibility to the United States in holding a security clearance.  Based on 
the foregoing, the Applicant does not raise a security concern and Guideline B is found for the Applicant.  </P>
