<P>Applicant was born in 1950 in the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria(British), now the Federal Republic of Nigeria (Nigeria). He became a United States 
citizen in 1990. His wife and one brother, are naturalized United States citizens, living in the United States. His daughter is American-born and living with him. 
One sister, a citizen of Nigeria, also lives in the United States. Security concerns have been raised because Applicant maintained dual citizenship, and because 
two of his brothers are citizens and residents of the Nigeria, three sisters are citizens of the Nigeria, and two of his sisters continue to reside there. Security 
concerns arising from possible foreign influence and foreign preference  are mitigated. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On April 25, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR details reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines B, Foreign Influence, and C, Foreign Preference, of the Directive. DOHA 
recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  </P> 
<P>On May 20, 2005, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. He requested a hearing. This matter was assigned to me on July 27, 2005. A 
notice of hearing was issued on August 18, 2005, and a hearing was held on September 15, 2005. Seven exhibits marked Government Exhibits 1 through 7 were 
admitted into evidence. Applicant's Exhibits A through C were admitted into evidence. One witness testified on behalf of Applicant, who also testified on his 
own behalf. The hearing transcript was received on September 29, 2005.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted, with explanation, all the allegations of the SOR.<A HREF="04-06593.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Those admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the
