<P>The Applicant was involved in three fights between 1997 and 1999, while he was in the Navy.  There have been no incidents in over four years.  Sufficient

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 16, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 21, 2003, and requested that the Decision be made without a hearing.  The Department Counsel 
submitted the File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on November 12, 2003.  The Applicant was given 30 days after receipt of the FORM to 
submit any additional information to the Administrative Judge.  The Applicant acknowledged receipt the FORM on December 2, 2003, and elected not to 
submit any additional information.  The case was received by the undersigned for Decision on April 26, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULING ON PRELIMINARY MATTERS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the FORM, Department Counsel made a motion to amend subparagraph 1.b. of the SOR.  In my opinion, subparagraph 1.b. as currently stated is legally 
sufficient.  The motion is therefor DENIED.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 31 and married.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Aircraft Worker, and he seeks to obtain a DoD security clearance in connection 
with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following 
findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the exhibits.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged 
in criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admitted in his Answer to being in three fights between 1997 and 1999 (SOR subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.).  Those admissions are hereby 
deemed findings of fact.  He denied subparagraph 1.d.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The first incident happened in 1997 when the Applicant was in the United States Navy.  He engaged in a mutual fight with another sailor after that sailor had 
called the Applicant's wife and told her about an alleged extra-marital affair of the Applicant.  He received non-judicial punishment for this incident.  
(Government Exhibits 7 at 1-2, and Government Exhibit 8.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In January 1999 the Applicant and another sailor were involved in a fight with two other sailors.  There is some evidence that the Applicant was the aggressor 
in this fight.  However, each participant provided a different version of events.  (Government Exhibit 7 at 2, and Government Exhibit 9.)  The Applicant was 
discharged from the Navy shortly after this incident and the local authorities declined to prosecute.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was involved in a fight with his wife in December 1999.  As a result of the incident, he was placed on two years unsupervised probation, fined 
$50.00 and required to attend a Community Corrections Program.  (Government Exhibit 7 at 3, and Government Exhibit 10.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant denied subparagraph 1.d.  In the FORM at page 7 Department Counsel states, "(T)he Government does not oppose a finding in favor of 
Applicant as to this allegation."  Accordingly, this subparagraph is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his Answer to the SOR the Applicant states, "I admit that in my past I have had several incidents where I have made poor judgment calls.  I have paid for 
those mistakes.  I have grown a lot over the years and I am more mature.  I have 3 kids and wife to support and provide for.  I do not think that I am a security 
risk."  (Government Exhibit 2 at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J (Criminal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) the criminal behavior was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(6) there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in criminal activity that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting or continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with 
evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of 
persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has engaged in several criminal acts between 1997 
and 1999 (Guideline J).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.  The Applicant's last incident took place in December 1999, over four 
years ago.  There is no indication that there have been any further incidents.  Disqualifying Condition 2 (<EM>a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>) 
applies.  However, given the span of time since the last incident, and the lack of any further incidents, Mitigating Conditions 1 (<EM>the criminal behavior was not 
recent</EM>) and 6 (<EM>there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>) also apply.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, this evidence is sufficient to 
overcome the adverse inferences of the Applicant's prior misconduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  
Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph of the Government's 
Statement of Reasons.</SPAN></P>
