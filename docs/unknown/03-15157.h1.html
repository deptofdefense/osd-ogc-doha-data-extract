<P>Applicant had five delinquent debts for about $34,000.  He reduced his discretionary spending, cancelled credit cards, and employed a debt management 
program to negotiate with creditors to pay his debts.  Applicant paid or has a plan to pay all his delinquent debts and will be debt free by 2007. Applicant 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On December 22, 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-15157.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing with an undated answer and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me 
arch 11, 2004.  A Notice of Hearing was issued March 12 2004.  On April 7, 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into 
evidence.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 14, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, 
and full consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is 36 years old, married, has two children, and works as a senior computer operator for a defense contractor. (Tr. 19, 21)</P> 
<P>Applicant worked for one defense contractor for seven years until he was laid off suddenly in 2002, and went on unemployment.  Applicant spent money based 
on an expectation of overtime work for his prior employer, and when that overtime reduced from 525 hours in one year to almost nothing, he found himself 
unable to repay all his debts in a timely manner.  He used credit cards to make up the difference in income.  Then, Applicant borrowed money to pay credit card 
debts.  When he was laid off from his job, he went on unemployment at a substantially reduced income, thereby further aggravating his financial situation.  He 
was employed in 2003 at a salary $10,000 less than he made when employed at his former employer.  The birth of Applicant's second child, now two years old, 
added expenses to his household budget, including medical bills for his wife who had a difficult pregnancy.  All of these events contributed to Applicant's 
financial problems, in addition to his family's spending habits. (Tr. 20 to 32, 51)</P> 
<P>Applicant discussed filing bankruptcy with an attorney, but decided he should pay his debts.  In 2001 he found a debt management service on the internet, and 
started paying it $645 monthly toward the settlement of his debts.  Over the past three years Applicant's payments have enabled this service to settle four debts, 
including two credit card debts listed in subparagraphs 1.c. and 1.e. in the SOR.  They were settled for less than originally owed.  A large part of each debt was 
accumulated interest. The remaining debts (subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.d.) are to be paid over the next 40 months.  That debt on credit cards totals about 
$29,000. (Tr. 30 to 47; Exhibits 2, 3 at 5 to 8, 4 at 1 and 2, 5, A, B, and C) </P> 
<P>Applicant has other credit cards outstanding with no balances, and his two department store credit cards were to be paid off in May 2004.  Applicant uses a 
monthly and weekly budget, and uses cash only for purchases.  Applicant also attempted to refinance his first and second mortgages to use any equity to pay off 
delinquent credit card debt, but his credit rating prevented that attempt from being consummated. (Tr. 36 to 59)</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well 
as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully considered in making the overall common 
sense determination required.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Those assessments include:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of 
knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the 
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  
Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or 
that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable 
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or 
other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified 
information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified 
information.  ISCR Case No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case by 
substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the 
ultimate burden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 
(App. Bd. 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national 
security." Directive &para; E2.2.2.  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 
12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F: Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) A history of not meeting financial obligations. E2.A6.1.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> E2.A6.1.2.3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's        control (loss of employment, unexpected medical emergency)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) The person has received counseling for the problem and there is clear indication </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">      the problem is being resolved or is under control. E2.A6.1.3.4.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(6) The individual initiated good-faith efforts to repay overdue creditors or otherwise</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">      resolve debts. E2.A6.1.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had delinquent debts that were in collection or charged off status (&para; 1.a.-1.e.) totaling approximately $34,000.  An 
applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Government established by substantial evidence 
each of the allegations in the SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations and is unable or unwilling to satisfy his debts, and 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 and 3 apply, respectively.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant contemplated seeking legal relief through bankruptcy, but decided to pay his debts with help from a debt management service.  Since 2001 Applicant 
has been paying $645 monthly to this service, which has paid off four debts, and three remain to be paid over the next 40 months.  Applicant has reduced his 
discretionary spending, and his wife is working full time.  His loss of employment, management's reduction of overtime</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and the difficult second pregnancy of 
Applicant's wife contributed to Applicant's financial problems.  His spending habits and use of credit cards, a common problem in modern America, also 
caused his financial problems.  Mitigating Conditions 3 (factors beyond Applicant's control), MC 4 (Applicant received counseling and there is clear evidence 
the problem is resolved or under control), and MC 6 (the individual initiated a good-faith effort, that means </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a reasonable, prudent, honest, and dutiful effort</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) apply.  I conclude this guideline for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
