</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 15, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review</EM> <EM>Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing why, pursuant to Guideline B-Foreign Influence, it could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a written response dated November 8, 2004, Applicant admitted to the five SOR allegations set forth.  
Additionally, Applicant requested an administrative determination based on the submissions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Consequentially, the matter was forwarded for referral to an 
Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's case was submitted on December 14, 2004, and a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="03-08695.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> as provided to Applicant.  
Applicant received a copy of the FORM on January 7, 2005.  Having been afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit evidence in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation of the allegations, Applicant, on January 18, 2005, responded with further explanation, financial documentation, and a letter of 
reference and support.  I was assigned this case on February 11, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted the factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence under Guideline B.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 44 year-old male who has been employed as a Field Service Representative by a defense contractor since September 1986 and has had a security 
clearance since 1988.  He was born in the United States and is a United States citizen.  In March 1996, while on assignment in Korea, Applicant married a 
Korean citizen.  The couple subsequently had two children prior to returning to the United States.  His wife has since become a registered alien with a pending 
application for United States citizenship; their children are citizens of the United States owing to their parentage.  In 2001, Applicant and his wife returned to 
Korea owing to a new work assignment.  Following his current interim assignment in Iraq, Applicant will return to Korea and is expected to be transferred back 
to the United States in the summer of 2005. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother-in-law and brother-in-law also live in Korea, although at some distance in a different province.  They remain citizens and residents of that 
country.  Applicant has extended financial support to them on two occasions since his 1996 marriage.  In 1998, when his mother-in-law was only working part-time because her husband was in failing health, Applicant and his wife gave his mother-in-law approximately $20,100.00 so that she could pay off her 
mortgage.<A HREF="03-08695.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  In 2001, he lent his brother-in-law approximately $40,000.00 so that he could purchase an automobile, licenses, and related necessities that would 
enable him to become an independent taxi operator.  Both the gift and the loan were funded from Applicant's personal financial holdings and paid through 
Applicant's United States bank.  Aside from these two isolated instances of financial support, Applicant only has occasional contact with his in-laws.<A HREF="03-08695.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In April 2002, Applicant purchased an apartment in order to avoid paying escalating rents during his current, multi-year assignment in Korea.  The purchase, 
valued at approximately $130,500.00, was funded by a portion of the proceeds from the 2001 sale of his home in the United States.  He intends to sell the 
apartment upon his return to the United States in the summer of 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's immediate supervisor has known him for 17 years.  He states that there is nothing to lead him to believe that Applicant is a security risk or is 
otherwise unworthy of holding a clearance.  The supervisor notes that all of the married personnel in Applicant's category have foreign-born spouses, either 
Korean or Filipino, and, consequentially, have foreign in-laws.  He similarly notes that, given the disparate resources between these United States employees 
and their foreign spouses' families, "giving occasional financial support is not unusual."<A HREF="03-08695.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, these adjudicative guidelines are subdivided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or 
revoke one's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to determine one 
could still be eligible for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In application, an Administrative Judge is not strictly bound to the adjudicative guidelines. As guidelines, they are but part of an amalgam of elements for the 
Administrative Judge to consider in assessing an applicant in light of the circumstances giving rise to the SOR, as well as in assessing the applicant as a whole.  
The concept of the "whole person" means that all available, reliable information about the person - whether it is good or bad, present or past - should be 
considered in making a fair, impartial, and meaningful decision as to his or her suitability to hold a security clearance.  To that end, Enclosure 2 also sets forth 
factors to be considered during this part of the adjudicative process, including: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and recency of the conduct; (4) the individuals age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) 
the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B-Foreign Influence.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he 
or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or 
financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a full and thorough examination, however, the final assessment must comport with the considerable gravity of the final decision.  There is no right to a 
security clearance<A HREF="03-08695.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and one seeking access to classified information must be prepared to enter into a fiduciary relationship with the United States Government 
that is inherently predicated on trust and confidence.  Therefore, when the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has the heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy.  Moreover, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"the 
clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-08695.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Finally, Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that 
industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned."  Therefore, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied 
decision as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all legal precepts, factors, and conditions, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">including those described briefly above, I find 
the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">With respect to Guideline B, the Government has established its case.  Applicant's wife, parents-in-law, and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of Korea.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Moreover, he has extended  financial assistance to his wife's family. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> As</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> such, the rebuttable presumption that there exists the potential for vulnerability to 
coercion, exploitation, or pressure, and the exercise of foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information is raised</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.  Foreign 
Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> may be raised, as here, if </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>(a)n immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close 
ties of affection or obligation , is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>.  The mere possession of fam</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ily ties in a foreign country, however, is 
not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  Whether an applicant's family ties in a foreign country pose a security risk depends on a common 
sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of those family ties.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  Moreover, FI DC E2.A2.1.2.8 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a substantial financial interest in a country, or in 
any foreign owned or operated business that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence</EM>.) may similarly be raised by virtue of Applicant's 
expenditure of funds within Korea.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">First, I have considered all the Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) under Guideline B in this case. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> The 1998 gift to Applicant's mother-in-law 
was an isolated, gift from Applicant and his wife in response to an immediate need; there is no evidence that it represents a financial interest or that it was an 
investment seeking any other return than the independent and separate maintenance of an aging couple.  His 2001 "loan" to the brother-in-law was predicated 
not on a desire to reap profit or create a financial interest, but "to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">help out."<A HREF="03-08695.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Extension of the loan in 2001 posed no risk or f</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">inancial burden on Applicant's 
United States-based investments and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">represented but a fraction of his net holdings.<A HREF="03-08695.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  T</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">oday, the loan has no impact on his current finances and satisfaction of 
the loan is not integral to Applicant's financial planning.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Moreover, his purchase of a Korean apartment, while a direct interest in Korea, was but a practical, 
temporary, means to an end.  By transferring some of the proceeds from the sale of his last U.S. home toward an interim foreign residence, Applicant self-subsidized his interim housing unfettered by rising rental costs and constrictive lease agreements.  Neither individually, nor collectively, are these expenditures 
substantial given Applicant's resources.  Therefore, I find that FI MC E2.A2.1.3.5 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the 
individual's security responsibilities</EM>) applies. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Moreover, inasmuch as none of these expenditures fail to constitute a disqualifying condition, I find for Applicant 
with regard to SOR subparagraphs 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Additionally, there is no evidence that Applicant's wife is an agent of a foreign power or otherwise in a position to be exploited by a foreign power.  Applicant 
complied with the security requirements and background checks for his wife prior to their marriage in 1996.<A HREF="03-08695.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> She is currently a registered alien with a pending 
application for U.S. citizenship, was residing in the United States until her husband's current assignment, is currently residing in Korea only as a consequence 
of her husband's employment, and will soon be returning to the United States.  Indeed, the couples' return this summer should quell any extraneous concerns 
and quickly render issues surrounding her physical presence in Korea moot.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  Therefore, I find that FI MC E2.A2.1.3 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a determination that the immediate family 
member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position 
to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States</EM>) applies.  
oreover, given her circumstances, I do not find her current presence in Korea to pose a disqualifying condition and, therefore, find SOR subparagraph 1.a. in 
Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's mother-in-law is a sexagenarian widow and his brother-in-law is an independent taxicab owner.  Applicant has met his burden in showing that his 
brother-in-law does not pose a risk, but he has failed to put forth any similar proffer with regard to his mother-in-law.  In the absence of elaboration as to her 
profession or position, I am unable to determine that she is neither an agent </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">of a foreign power nor otherwise in a position to be exploited.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Therefore, because 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> I cannot find that FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1 is applicable to the mother-in-law.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">There is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant has ties of affection for, or obligation to, his spouse's immediate family members.<A HREF="03-08695.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Here, Applicant's 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">relationship with his in-laws, while no doubt respectful and gracious, does not seem intimate.  First, their contact is infrequent, "occasional," and only 
incidental to his wife's contact with them. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Second, Applicant's two isolated incidents of financial assistance were clearly designed to foster distant 
independence and independent living, not invite deeper familial bonds or initiate on-going support or obligation.  Indeed, despite living in the same country for 
the past few years - albeit in different provinces - there is no evidence of any party capitalizing on this proximity </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">by relocating or otherwise increasing contact.  
Third, given current plans to relocate back in the United States in the summer 2005, it is logical to expect that even current casual levels of "occasional" contact 
will be further attenuated.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">There is no denying that ties exist between Applicant and his in-laws by virtue of his marriage, but the existent ties, as demonstrated 
by the facts to be casual and infrequent, pose only minimal risk.  Consequentially, I find that FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>contact and correspondence with foreign 
citizens are casual and infrequent</EM>) applies.  I additionally find that the existence of in-laws who reside in and are citizens of Korea, under these facts, is not a 
disqualifying condition.  Therefore, I find SOR subparagraph 1.b in Applicant's favor.  No other mitigating conditions apply</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Second, I have considered the whole person concept.  Applicant has been steadily employed by the same U.S. employer since 1986 and he has held a security 
clearance since 1988.  He has diligently created and grown an admirable portfolio of United States funds and, in light of his explanation as to why he chose to 
purchase, rather than rent, an apartment in Korea, he has also demonstrated personal parsimony and sound judgment.  His contact with Korea is incidental to the 
employment for which he maintains a security clearance; his contact with his in-laws is incidental to his marriage and is minimal.  He has helped assure the 
individual independence of his in-laws by providing well intentioned, but distant, dispassionate, and measured support - and has done so without risk to his own 
finances or to his fiduciary obligations as the recipient of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Third, Korea </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">can best be characterized as a friendly country that is not currently known to pose unacceptable hostage risks. Whatever potential security risks 
arise as the result of Applicant's having in-laws in Korea</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, they are by every reasonable measure mitigated. This situation is in marked contrast to a situation 
extant in a country with interests inimical to those of the United States. Despite some history of economic and proprietary intelligence gathering, Korea</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> remains 
a friend of the United States and is a country whose democratic institutions are not incompatible with our own traditions and respect for human rights and the 
rule of law.  While the foreign influence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines are ostensibly neutral as to the nature of the subject country, they should not 
be construed to ignore the geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign regime involved.  Korea</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, while reported to target the United States and its 
companies in the past for economic and proprietary information, is still a country with no known recent history of hostage taking or disposition for exerting 
undue influence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> to obtain either classified information, or unclassified economic and proprietary data.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Combined with the determinations above, I </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">find that any 
potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's extended family in Korea</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's 
ability to withstand any such risks of undue influence.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for this Applicant.  Accordingly, Guideline B is decided for Applicant</SPAN></P>
