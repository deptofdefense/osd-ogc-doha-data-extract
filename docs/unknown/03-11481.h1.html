<P>Applicant, born in the People's Republic of China (PRC), moved with his family when he was young to Republic of China (Taiwan). He came to the United 
States in 1969 and became a United States citizen in 1978.  His wife, two children and five siblings are also United States citizens and residents. His father, 
who is elderly and ill, is a citizen and resident of Taiwan.  He is not in a position to be exploited by Taiwan, in a way that could force Applicant to choose

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">December</SPAN> 7, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 
11328 and 12829) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct 
proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, or denied.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant<EM></EM> filed a notarized response, incorrectly dated <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">December</SPAN> 14, 2006, the correct date is <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">December</SPAN> 14, 2005, to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and 
requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. On February 17, 2006, the case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing. 
Pursuant to formal notice, dated <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">April 21, 2006</SPAN>, a hearing was held on May 9, 2006.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered twelve documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1-12) and no witnesses were called. Applicant, through 
counsel, offered 37 documentary exhibits (Exhibits A-KK) and offered his testimony and that of two other witnesses. The transcript (Tr) was received on May 
19, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B (</SPAN>Foreign Influence<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) of the Directive. The SOR contains seven 
allegations, 1.a., through </SPAN>1.g.,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under Guideline B. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of 
fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testimony of 
Applicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 61 years old. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">He is employed by a defense contractor </SPAN>as an Engineer, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in 
the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant was born in the PRC. When he was young, he  moved to Taiwan with his family, and he grew up there. He served in the Taiwan navy, as a 
compulsory requirement. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN>  came to the United States in 1969. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He received a Ph.D. degree in engineering in 1973 from a </SPAN>United States<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> university,</SPAN> and 
he became a <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">naturalized </SPAN>United States citizen in 1978. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's wife, who was born in the PRC, also became a United States citizen.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> and his wife have a son and a daughter, both of whom were born in 
the United States. Applicant, his wife, and children are solely United States citizens. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> has five siblings, all of whom are United States citizens and 
residents.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">'s father is a </SPAN>citizen and resident of Taiwan<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. He worked for the Taiwanese army as a judge, and he retired around1970. He then worked as a law 
professor and attorney. He is now 88 years old, long retired and suffers from Alzheimer's disease. His father had lived in the </SPAN>United States<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> for many years as a 
permanent resident, but he was unable to pass the </SPAN>United States <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">citizenship exam because of his inability to speak English well. After </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> mother died 
in the </SPAN>United States<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> father desired to return to Taiwan. </SPAN>Applicant <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">communicates with him in Taiwan in a limited fashion approximately once a 
month.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 2003,  as </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  father had become ill and frail,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> went to Taiwan to check his father into a nursing home,. In 2004, at the request of 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> son's wife, Applicant traveled with his family to the PRC for the sole purpose of sightseeing. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> consulted and got approval from his 
company security officer and consulted with them after returning. This was </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> first trip to the PRC in 55 years.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> does not have any current financial interest in Taiwan.  He and his five siblings each contribute $200 a month for the care of their father in Taiwan. 
He estimated that his financial holdings in this country are worth <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">approximately</SPAN> $2 million.</P> 
 
<P>In 1978, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> met an individual from Taiwan, during professional and social gatherings in the United States. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During a period when Applicant held a 
Department of Defense Industrial Security Clearance, he</SPAN> arranged for meetings between representatives of his employer, a United States contractor, and 
representatives of Taiwan. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> revealed some background and research information to this individual that he believed did not violate any <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN> or 
company policy. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> believed that he was helping his company and helping Taiwan at the same time, and that he was not violating any rules or 
regulations. </P> 
 
<P>Subsequent to the meetings, this individual gave to <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> a payment of $400 as a thank-you and to defray some expenses. There was never any suggestion 
from this individual, nor was there any belief by <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant,</SPAN> that this payment was an attempt to influence <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN>'s future conduct.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN> last contact 
with this individual was in 1985. In a <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">October</SPAN> 11, 1990 Security Clearance Application (SCA), <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> failed to identify the situation discussed above. 
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> believed that he only had to reveal any incidences within a  five year period, and this was beyond that scope. In fact, this incident is not beyond the 
scope of the <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN>'s question, and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN>  should have revealed it. </P> 
 
<P>In 1982, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">while Applicant held a Department of Defense Industrial Security Clearance, he</SPAN> delivered a lecture at an institute in Taiwan, based on a paper he had 
published when he was with a former United States employer. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> had been invited to give this lecture by a Taiwanese engineer. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The lecture was given 
during a period that Applicant was in Taiwan visiting his father. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> was given a payment of $1,000 for this presentation from the Taiwanese institute. In an <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">October</SPAN> 11, 1990 Security Clearance Application (SCA), 
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> failed to identify that he had given a lecture and received $1,000, as discussed above. Again, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> believed that he only had to reveal any 
incidences within a  five year period, and this was beyond that scope. This incident also was not beyond the scope of the <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">'s question, and Applicant  
should have revealed this information, as well. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>None of the material furnished by <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> was ever found to be classified or company sensitive. Applicant <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> acknowledged his naivete regarding security 
matters in the early 1980s and that he was not as aware of proper reporting requirements at that time. </SPAN>There has been no allegation or evidence to suggest that 
subsequent to the events alleged  in 1.f. and 1.g., of the SOR, as discussed above, and of which the <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN> became aware in 1991 <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Exhibit 3)</SPAN>, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> 
has violated any security procedure or failed to disclose any required information to the United States<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN>. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is extremely accomplished. He holds 35 patents with his company and holds the prestigious position of Fellow in the Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Exhibits G, II)</SPAN>. He has contributed to four books and published 70 papers.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A co-worker of Applicant</SPAN> testified on his behalf. He has known <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> since 1979. He testified that, ". . . as far as loyalty to the U.S., it's unquestionable." 
He concluded that <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> "is very, very trustworthy" (Tr at 54).  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN>  also submitted a letter from a vice president of <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN>'s  current employer<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">,</SPAN> 
who has known him for about ten years. He described him in very positive terms as "highly professional, very bright, creative, honest, forthright, very hard-working and highly respected by everyone" (Exhibit GG). <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN>  also introduced his 2004 Employee Performance Summary, which rated him as Exceeding 
Requirements (Exhibit F).</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN> considered<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN>The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, etc. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2).</SPAN>  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><EM></EM><STRONG><EM></EM>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite 
the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of 
an applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency 
of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </P> 
 
<P>the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department of the Navy v. Egan</SPAN>, 484 U.S. 518, 531</P> 
 
<P>(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</P> 
 
<P><EM><CENTER></CENTER> 
</EM></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by 
affection, influence or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. Based on the evidence of record, the Government has 
established an initial  reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of Guideline B (Foreign Influence)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's father is a <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">citizen and resident of</SPAN> Taiwan. The citizenship and residency of Applicant's family create the potential for foreign influence that could 
result in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of 
such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of 
persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for him. This </SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has done. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The evidence of Applicant's family member, who is a citizen and resident of Taiwan, comes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1, "immediate 
family members, or persons to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, who are citizens of, or resident in, a foreign country." DC 
E2.1.2.4., "Failing to report, where required, associations with foreign nationals" may also be argued to apply. However, the conduct last occurred in the early 
1980s, and there is no indication that any such conduct has occurred in over 20 years. Also, I find that  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN> failure to report was due to a 
misunderstanding, not a desire to hide information from the United States <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN>.</P> 
 
<P>Based on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence, I have determined that his father in Taiwan does not constitute an unacceptable 
security risk, and the Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A2.1.3.1, "a determination that the immediate family member(s) . . . in question are not agents of a foreign 
power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the 
United States," applies. MC  E2.A2.1.3.3, "Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent"certainly mitigates this case as well. </P> 
 
<P>The primary factors in mitigation that I have considered include: Applicant's long and successful history since coming to the United States in 1969 and 
becoming a United  States citizen in 1978; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">his devotion to his wife and his two children, as well as his five siblings, who are all United States citizens and 
residents; </SPAN>the frail and weakening condition of his father; his significant financial holdings in the United States; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">his acknowledging his naivete regarding 
security matters in the early 1980s and his excellent security record since that time, and </SPAN>Applicant's<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> strong feelings concerning his devotion to this country</SPAN>.  </P> 
 
<P>         After considering all of the evidence of record on these issues, I conclude that the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the 
SOR, and even in the unlikely event pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would resist it and would  report the 
incident to the proper authorities. </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>         <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that Applicant has overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>
