<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated May 27, 2004, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline C (Foreign Preference), Guideline B 
(Foreign Influence), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated April 
6, 2005.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by not taking into account Applicant's claim that a female 
coworker with a grudge against him was the source of some of the allegations against him; (2) whether the Administrative Judge failed to give sufficient 
consideration to Applicant's disclosures about his past conduct; (3) whether some of the Administrative Judge's findings of fact are not supported by the record 
evidence; and (4) whether the Administrative Judge should have concluded Applicant's conduct and circumstances were mitigated sufficiently to warrant a 
favorable security clearance decision.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant's appeal brief contains several arguments that essentially ask the Board to evaluate his security eligibility and reach a favorable security clearance 
decision.  The Board does not retry a case on appeal.  Rather, the Board reviews an Administrative Judge's decision to determine whether the  appealing parties 
have identified any factual or legal error in the Judge's decision.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  The Board will address only 
those arguments made by Applicant that can be construed as challenging the Judge's decision.<A HREF="03-08525.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by not taking into account Applicant's claim that a female coworker with a grudge against him was the source of 
some of the allegations against him</SPAN>.  In response to the SOR and the File of Relevant Material, Applicant asserted that a female coworker  with whom he had an 
intimate relationship in the past made false accusations against him and revealed things about him to his employer and the Department of Defense to start a 
review of his security eligibility.  On appeal, Applicant repeats that claim and argues the Judge should have taken it into account in evaluating his security 
clearance.</P> 
<P>Apart from Applicant's assertions, there is no record evidence that indicates whether the female coworker identified by Applicant provided information about 
him to the Department of Defense in connection with the investigation of his case.  Significantly, the File of Relevant Material does not contain any written 
statement by the female coworker about Applicant.  Moreover, it is legally irrelevant whether the female coworker identified by Applicant did or did not 
provide information about him to the Department of Defense.  The File of Relevant Material contains documentary evidence not provided by the female 
coworker which provides a legally permissible basis for the Judge to make findings and reach conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility.</P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge failed to give sufficient consideration to Applicant's disclosures about his past conduct</SPAN>.  Applicant asserts that, apart from 
his falsification of the security clearance application concerning his past drug use, he has been honest about his conduct and circumstances with his facility 
security officer and the federal government.  He also argues that his honesty shows he is trustworthy and should be granted a security clearance.  The Board 
construes this argument as raising the issue of whether the Judge failed to give sufficient consideration to Applicant's disclosures about his past conduct.</P> 
<P>Applicant's disclosures about his conduct and circumstances did not preclude the Administrative Judge from considering the security significance of his 
conduct and circumstances.<A HREF="03-08525.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The Judge was not required to conclude the security concerns raised by Applicant's conduct and circumstances were extenuated 
or mitigated by Applicant's disclosures.<A HREF="03-08525.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether some of the Administrative Judge's findings of fact are not supported by the record evidence</SPAN>.  Applicant contends the Administrative Judge erred by 
finding: (a) his girlfriend was only 13 years old in 2003; (b) he molested a minor; (c) he cheated in his academic work for six years; and (d) he falsified a 
security clearance application by not disclosing that he had been suspended from summer employment in 2000 for providing alcohol to underage students.</P> 
<P>Given the record evidence in this case, the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant's girlfriend was 13 years old in 2003.  However, the record 
evidence supports the Judge's finding that Applicant fondled his girlfriend's breasts before she reached the age of consent under applicable state law.</P> 
<P>The Administrative Judge did not find that Applicant cheated in his academic work for six years.  Rather, the Judge found Applicant cheated on his university 
examinations at least five times between 1997 and 2003.  That finding by the Judge is supported by record evidence.</P> 
<P>Considering the record as a whole, there is not sufficient record evidence to sustain the Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant falsified a security 
clearance application by not disclosing he had been suspended from summer employment in 2000.  However, that error is harmless because the Judge's other 
sustainable findings are sufficient to support his overall adverse conclusions under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).</P> 
<P>4. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge should have concluded Applicant's conduct and circumstances were mitigated sufficiently to warrant a favorable security 
clearance decision</SPAN>.  Applicant makes various arguments that the Board construe as raising the issue of whether the Administrative Judge should have concluded 
Applicant's conduct and circumstances were mitigated sufficiently to warrant a favorable security clearance decision.  Those arguments can be summarized as 
follows: (a) although he gave money to his Mexican girlfriend's family, he did not have control over how they used that money; (b) the illegal activities of two 
exican uncles should not be held against him; (c) there is no evidence that his relatives in Mexico are agents of a foreign power or that they are in a position 
to be exploited by a foreign power in a manner that would force him to choose between them and the United States; (d) his falsification of the security clearance 
application was mitigated under Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 2; (e) the record evidence shows he has exhibited a pattern of maturity, compassion, 
reliability, and honesty; (f) he has learned from his past mistakes and has accepted responsibility for them; and (f) he would never do anything to jeopardize the 
national security.</P> 
<P>Considering the record evidence as a whole, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Administrative Judge to conclude that the overall facts and circumstances 
of Applicant's giving money to the family of his Mexican girlfriend (who Applicant knows is an illegal alien in the United States) raised security concerns.  It 
was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to conclude that the facts and circumstances of Applicant's action placed him in a situation of vulnerability because 
his money was used to smuggle other illegal aliens into the United States.</P> 
<P>There is record evidence to support the Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant has two uncles who were involved, in the past, with importing illegal 
drugs from Mexico into the United States.  Nothing in the decision below indicates or suggests that the Judge held Applicant responsible for the illegal drug 
activities of those two uncles.  Considering the record as a whole, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to consider Applicant's past association with 
those two uncles as part of his evaluation of the security significance of the totality of Applicant's contacts and ties with relatives in Mexico under Guideline B 
(Foreign Influence).<A HREF="03-08525.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>There is no record evidence that Applicant's Mexican girlfriend or her relatives are agents of a foreign power.  However, the absence of such evidence did not 
compel the Administrative Judge to apply Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1.<A HREF="03-08525.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 is not applicable unless both 
(a) an applicant's immediate family members or associates in question are not agents of a foreign power; <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">and</SPAN> (b) an applicant's immediate family members or 
associates in question are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power.<A HREF="03-08525.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Furthermore, Applicant's appeal argument appears to assume that Department 
Counsel must present evidence to affirmatively disprove the applicability of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1.  Department Counsel is not required to 
disprove the applicability of Adjudicative Guidelines mitigating conditions; rather, an applicant has the burden of presenting evidence sufficient to warrant 
application of such mitigating conditions.<A HREF="03-08525.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Applicant has not presented any persuasive argument for why the Judge should have concluded that Foreign 
Influence Mitigating Condition 1 is applicable in light of the record evidence in this case.</P> 
<P>Applicant's argument concerning Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 2<A HREF="03-08525.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> is not persuasive.  Given the record evidence in this case, Applicant's disclosures 
to the DSS investigator  might warrant consideration of Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 3,<A HREF="03-08525.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> not Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 2.<A HREF="03-08525.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  As to the 
applicability of Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 3, the record evidence in this case did not compel the Judge to find, as a matter of law, that Applicant 
made prompt, good-faith disclosures to the DSS investigators before he was confronted with the facts of his misconduct.</P> 
<P>The federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to classified information.<A HREF="03-08525.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  The federal 
government does not have to wait until an applicant commits a security violation before it can decide to deny or revoke access to classified information.<A HREF="03-08525.a1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  
Considering the record as a whole, the Administrative Judge had a rational basis for concluding that the totality of Applicant's conduct and circumstances 
raised security concerns under both Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Moreover, given the record evidence available to the 
Judge, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to conclude Applicant had not demonstrated extenuation or mitigation of the security concerns raised by 
the totality of his conduct and circumstances.  It was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to conclude that Applicant had not presented evidence that showed 
that he had learned from his past mistakes and would not repeat them.</P>
