<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 1, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged 
security concerns under Guideline J for criminal conduct and Guideline E for personal conduct. In a sworn statement dated April 27, 2005, Applicant admitted 
allegations 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., and 1.i. of the SOR. He denied allegations 1.a., 1.h., 1.j., 1.k., 2.a., and 2.b.  He did not provide a response to 
allegations 2.c. and 2.d. Applicant requested a hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on September 22, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on September 28, 2005, scheduling the hearing for October 20, 2005. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted six exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6, and admitted without 
objections. Applicant testified, had a witness testify, and submitted five exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) A through E, and admitted 
without objections. The transcript was received on November 1, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 56-year-old truck driver who has worked for a federal contractor since approximately 2002. Applicant has been married and divorced twice. He 
has six children, three from each marriage. All the children are grown and only one lives with Applicant. Applicant was married to his first wife from 
approximately 1966 to 1977. He was married to his second wife from approximately 1980 to approximately 1991. From 1994 to 1996 Applicant and his second 
wife lived together off-and-on in an attempt at reconciliation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested on July 17, 1978, and charged with sexual assault, a felony. Applicant was accused of molesting his first wife's daughter. She was 
approximately eleven years old. The charges were later dismissed. Applicant adamantly denied the charge and claimed he was falsely accused. He claims his 
then in-laws were involved in the accusations because they did not like him. Applicant and his first wife divorced after this allegation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 11, 1994, Applicant returned home from driving his truck on an extended road trip, and discovered his ex-wife (who he had been living with) 
and another man together. Applicant had an altercation with both his ex-wife and the man. Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Battery-Domestic 
Abuse, (2) Disorderly Conduct, and (3) Contact After Domestic Abuse Arrest. Applicant was found guilty of Count (1) that was amended to Disorderly 
Conduct and fined $286.00. Counts (2) and (3) were dismissed.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested on June 16, 1995, and charged with disorderly conduct. He was found guilty and fined.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested on April 14, 1996, and charged with disorderly conduct-domestic abuse related. He was fined. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested on May 11, 1996, and charged with disorderly conduct-domestic abuse related. The charge was not prosecuted. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested on May 16, 1996, and charged with disorderly conduct-domestic abuse related. He entered a no contest plea, was found guilty, and fined 
$203.00 to include court costs. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested on July 15, 1996, and charged with (1) Disorderly Conduct-Domestic Abuse Related, and (2) Domestic Abuse Restraining Order 
Violation. Applicant was found guilty of Count (1) and fined $203.00. Count (2) was not prosecuted.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested on October 30, 1996, and charged with shoplifting. Applicant denies he shoplifted. He claimed he brought an item into the restroom 
with him and leaned it against the wall. He was then retained. Applicant claimed he did not intend to steal the item, but because it was the only item left of its 
kind, he wanted to make sure no one bought it while he was in the restroom, so he took it with him. Applicant was fined and sentenced to six months probation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested on May 29, 1998, and charged with disorderly conduct. Applicant had an altercation with his then girlfriend. Applicant was found guilty 
and fined $209.00.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was cited on September 26, 1998, and charged with hit and run. Applicant denied  he was involved in this incident. The charge was dismissed. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A civil suit was filed against Applicant on January 10, 2000 for Child Abuse Restraining Order. Another civil suit was filed against Applicant on January 13, 
2000 for a Harassment Restraining Order. Both cases were dismissed. These cases stemmed from an allegation that Applicant hit the child of the woman he was 
then living with. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filled out a security clearance application (SCA) and sworn to it on April 15, 2001. Applicant had his girlfriend assist him in filling out the 
application because his handwriting is illegible. However, he provided the answers to her to write for him and he reviewed its contents</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">before signing it. Applicant answered "No" to Question 23 (a),<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> which was false. Applicant had been arrested and charged with a felony on July 17, 1978, that 
was later dismissed. Applicant stated he thought because the charge was eventually dropped he did not have to put it on his SCA.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also answered "No" to Question 23 (f),<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> which was false in that Applicant had numerous arrests during the past seven years from the date of the 
application. Applicant admitted to being arrested for all the incidents alleged, but disputed that he committed the allegations in 1.a.,1.h., and 1.j. Applicant 
stated, "I wasn't going to admit to something I didn't do. But I did, I did get arrested and the charges were dropped. And they told me that they would not show 
on my record, so I didn't think no more about it. And when I filled this out, I figured, you know, it's not on my record, I don't need to put it on there."<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
Applicant claimed he misunderstood this question and should have stated "yes" because his offenses did occur within the past seven years. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was characterized by a person who knows him as honest and forthcoming.<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> He is seen as a hard working and timely employee who followed his 
employer's administrative policies.<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> He is considered a dependable and courteous driver,<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> who has demonstrated a high level of responsibility and performed 
well.<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Considering the evidence as a whole, 
Guideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline E, personal conduct considerations, with their respective DC and MC, apply in this case. Additionally, each 
security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person 
concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) 
the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, 
willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the 
circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not 
outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">him.<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J-Criminal Conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior indicates 
an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E-Personal Conduct is a security concern when an individual's conduct involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guideline J and Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of 
whether the person was formally charged), </EM>and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser charges) </EM>apply. Applicant was arrested nine 
times from 1978 through 1998. Applicant was found guilty seven times for criminal offenses. I find Applicant deliberately failed to tell the truth when filling 
out his SCA, a criminal offense.<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>The conduct was not 
recent),</EM> CC MC E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>The crime was an isolated incident), </EM>CC MC E2.A10.1.2.4 (<EM>The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors 
leading to the violation are not likely to recur)</EM>, and CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6 (<EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation)</EM>. Most of Applicant's offenses 
occurred from 1998 and earlier. Because I have found that Applicant intentionally failed to provide accurate information on his SCA, a federal crime, I can not 
apply CC MC E2.A10.1.2. 1. due to the recency of his criminal actions. The frequency of Applicant's criminal conduct, seven convictions , precludes applying 
CC MC E2.A10.1.2.2, that his actions were isolated. Applicant has a history of domestic abuse, with at least two women and allegations of child abuse. Under 
those circumstances, I can not find that such violations are not likely to recur. Finally, there was no evidence presented to convince me that Applicant is 
successfully rehabilitated. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant 
and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine 
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM> <EM>), </EM>and PC 
DC E2.A5.1.2.5 (<EM>A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the 
agency)</EM> apply in this case. Applicant did not list his felony charge and any of his arrests on his SCA. He did not voluntarily disclose this information before he 
was interviewed. Applicant has a 20-year history of violating the law and continued to do so when he deliberately omitted relevant information on his SCA. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Allegations 2.c. and 2.d. of the SOR allege two civil suits were filed against Applicant and later dismissed. Applicant denied the charges in the suits, and no 
other information was provided. Therefore, I find for the Applicant with regards to these allegations, because there is not enough evidence to make any type of 
meaningful determination about these allegations, other than a document stating a suit had been filed and dismissed. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) E2.A5.1.3.2 (<EM>The falsification was 
an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily), </EM>PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3 (<EM>The individual made 
prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts), </EM>and PC MC E2.A5.1.3.5 (<EM>The individual has taken positive steps 
to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress). </EM>I conclude none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant's failed to 
provide vital information that was part of his </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SCA. Applicant made an intentional decision that he was not going to put down offenses that he believed were not on his record, despite the plain language of 
the questions asking him to do so. Even when the plain language specifically asked him about his arrests in the past seven years, many that he was convicted of, 
he chose to state he had none. Applicant's lack of candor and willingness to interpret the questions that most favored what responses he chose to provide is a 
serious security concern. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was interviewed for his SCA three years later.<A HREF="04-03754.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> During those intervening years Applicant did not correct the false answers on his SCA, but rather 
admitted them only after he was interviewed. Applicant at first claimed he did not understand the security questions, but later he admitted he did not know why 
he did not list his arrests. Applicant's testimony was not credible. I find PC MC E2.A5.1.3.2 and PC MC E2.A5.1.3.5 do not apply because his actions were not 
isolated, and he lied on two questions. I also find Applicant did not subsequently voluntarily provide the correct information nor did he correct the falsification 
before being confronted with the facts. Applicant has provided no evidence to show he has taken any steps to reduce his vulnerability. Applicant's lack of 
candor and dishonesty reflects directly on his trustworthiness. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concern regarding his personal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the evidence in the record and the whole person concept. Applicant's criminal history, lack of candor, and dishonesty, demonstrate 
questionable judgment and raise serious security concerns. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding his criminal conduct and personal 
conduct. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a 
security clearance. Accordingly, Guidelines J and Guideline E are decided against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
