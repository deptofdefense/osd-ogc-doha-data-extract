<P>The Applicant's failure to disclose a judgment entered against him within the last seven years on his security clearance has been mitigated.  His felony arrest in 
1996 has not been mitigated by sufficient evidence of reform and rehabilitation.  Clearance is denied.  </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On June 19, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on July 8, 2002, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the 
undersigned on November 27, 2002.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A notice of hearing was issued on December 10, 2002, scheduling the hearing for January 30, 2003.  On January 17, 2003, 
Applicant's counsel requested a 30 day continuance based upon good cause.  The parties stipulated to a 21 day continuance and the hearing was rescheduled for 
February 20, 2003.  At the hearing the Government presented eight exhibits.  The Applicant presented ten exhibits.  The Applicant called two witnesses and 
testified on his own behalf.  The Applicant submitted one Post Hearing Exhibit.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on March 6, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 50 years old.  He is employed as a Plant Protection Officer by a defense contractor and is applying for a security clearance in connection with 
his employment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material 
aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) dated August 3, 1999.  Question 37, asked, "In the last seven years have you 
had any judgments against you that have not been paid?"  The Applicant answered "No".  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Item 1).  This was a false statement.  The truth is 
that the Applicant had one judgment entered against him in June 1997, for a child support arrearage, in the amount of $7,918.00, that was unpaid at the time he 
completed the application.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 7).  In late 1997, the Applicant's wages were garnished for about three months.  His federal and state tax 
refunds were intercepted in the Spring of 2000, and were applied to the arrearage.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant explained that at the time he completed the security clearance application, he was not aware of the judgment.  He explained that the judgment 
arose out of a situation where his wife obtained welfare based on her representations to Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) that she had custody 
of the children of their marriage.  The truth is that the Applicant had legal custody of these children at all pertinent times.  The Applicant testified that he went 
to court with documents, including his children's report cards showing his signature, to prove that he had custody of the children.  He turned the paperwork 
over to the court clerk under the belief that the judgment had been rescinded.  When he met with the Special Agent from the Defense Security Service (DSS) on 
arch 17, 2000, he was first again confronted with the fact that the judgment still existed.  Following his interview, the Applicant then checked it out for 
himself and confirmed the fact that the judgment still existed.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 2002, the Applicant's attorney negotiated a payment arrangement with the county on behalf of the Applicant which provided that the Applicant 
make payments of $160.00 monthly, coming automatically out of his payroll check.  At one time he owed as much as $17,000.00, but has now reduced the debt 
to $9,000.00.  (Tr. pp. 70-76). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his sworn statement to DSS on March 17, 2000, the Applicant explained that he did not disclose the judgment on his security clearance application because 
he did not think the judgment was correct and that he was not responsible for the child support claim.  He was even assured by the court clerk that there was 
some problem with it, and it appeared that the Applicant had been wronged.  The court clerk indicated that he would give his information and documents to a 
caseworker to be straightened out.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 4).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the particular facts of this case, I find that the Applicant was under the mistaken belief that the judgment was rescinded.  He is not an attorney but a <EM>pro 
se </EM>individual who could reasonably have believed that by taking his children's report cards to the court clerk, the judgment might have been affected in some 
way and even rescinded.  There is no evidence in the record that after he submitted these documents to the court, that he was put on notice that the judgment 
still existed.  I find his excuse believable.  Accordingly, I find that the Applicant did not intentionally or deliberately conceal this judgment from the 
Government on his security clearance application.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Allegation 1.(a).2, set forth in the SOR is also found for the Applicant as the judgment in question was not entered until September 27, 1999, over a month after 
the Applicant completed his security clearance application on August 3, 1999.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal 
conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>On December 31, 1989, the Applicant and his family moved from City A to City B in search of a new start on life.  His wife needed to get away from the circle 
of friends who influenced her drinking problem.  In City B, however, he was unable to find regular full time employment.  He found two part-time minimum 
wage jobs, but was still unable to make ends meet.  He and his wife separated, and he and his children were forced to move in with his sister.  After a short 
while, he could no longer stay with his sister and he could not afford to feed, clothe or shelter his children without some assistance.  The Applicant admitted 
that he lied under oath, so that his children would obtain a greater amount of welfare assistance and food stamps than they were otherwise entitled to.  He 
admitted that he committed perjury and fraud.  In essence, he applied for and received AFDC welfare assistance and food stamps and did not report all of his 
income and earnings.  In late 1993, the Applicant moved back to City A and took a job that paid him for as many as thirty two hours of work.  He then reported 
his income and stopped taking welfare assistance.   </P> 
<P>On December 3, 1996, the Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) violation of Welfare and Institutions Code- Fraudulently Obtaining Aid For Children 
and (2) Perjury, two counts, all charges felony violations.  He was sentenced to five days in jail, which was suspended, he was ordered to make restitution in the 
amount of $2,800.00, perform 80 hours of community service, given three years probation, and if the set conditions were successfully fulfilled, the charges 
would be reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor.  On December 21, 1998, the Applicant was sentenced to 45 days in jail for failing to make restitution.  
Imposition of sentence was stayed until February 26, 1999, at which time the Applicant paid the restitution in full.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibits 2,3, 4 and 5).  </P> 
<P>The Applicant testified that he has made full restitution and the charges were reduced to  misdemeanors.  An affidavit submitted by the Applicant's attorney 
indicates that the Applicant's  probation on this offense was terminated in December 2000.  (<EM>See</EM>, Applicant's Post Hearing Exhibit).      </P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</P> 
<P>The Applicant's present supervisor, who has known the Applicant for the past four years, testified that the Applicant is honest, trustworthy and extremely 
responsible on the job.  He can find no reason why the Applicant should not be eligible for a security clearance.  (Tr. pp. 31-35).</P> 
<P>The Applicant's daughter whom he adopted when she was one years old, and who is now 23 years old, testified that she has lived with the Applicant her entire 
life.  They have never lived lavishly and only had the simple material things they needed.  The Applicant has been her sole financial support, and he has always 
done all of the domestic duties in the home for her and her brother.  She moved away in 1999.  (Tr. pp. 39-46).  The Applicant is obviously well respected by 
his daughter.      </P>

</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.   Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of dishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant engaged in criminal conduct (Guideline J).  This evidence indicates poor 
judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a 
nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P>As previously discussed, I have reviewed the Applicant's excuse for not providing information concerning his 1997 judgment on his application, and find it 
credible.  Accordingly,  Guideline E, (Personal Conduct) is found for the Applicant.      </P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On the other hand, the Applicant's criminal charges and convictions for Obtaining Aid by Fraud and perjury are serious offenses that cannot be ignored.  The 
Applicant violated the law because his earnings had fallen to what he considered to be poverty level and he could not afford to feed himself and his two children 
or provide for their general support.  However, under any circumstances, no matter how desperate one may get, this reason does not justify his criminal actions.  
He lied under oath on a Government document, committing perjury and fraudulently applied for and received welfare and food stamps for himself and his 
family that he was not entitled to for more than two years.  Although the incident occurred almost ten years ago, he was charged and convicted just five years 
ago, and only completed his probation for the offense in December 2000.  The nature of this offense is so serious, more time in needed to ensure the 
Government that the Applicant is sufficiently trustworthy to access classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 2 of the Government's Statement of 
Reasons.     </SPAN></P>
