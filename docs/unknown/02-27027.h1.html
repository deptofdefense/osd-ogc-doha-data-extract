<P>The Applicant used crystal methamphetamine once in 1997 and approximately ten times in 2001.  Both periods of use were connected to domestic strife.  He 
had a security clearance the entire time.  He expresses a credible intent not to use illegal drugs in the future and has three years of abstinence.  Adverse inference

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 3, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 25, 2004, and requested that the Decision be made without a hearing.  The Department Counsel 
submitted the File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on June 7, 2004.  The Applicant was given 30 days after receipt of the FORM to submit any 
additional information to the Administrative Judge.  The Applicant acknowledged receipt the FORM on June 21, 2004, and submitted additional information on 
July 14, 2004.  The Department Counsel did not object to the admission of the additional information.  The case was received by the undersigned for Decision 
on July 28, 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 37 and married.  He is employed by a Defense contractor, and he seeks to retain a DoD security clearance previously granted in connection 
with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  
The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits 
and the live testimony.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug abuse)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal 
drugs.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant first used crystal methamphetamine in 1997.  He indicates that this occurred after he was involved in a physical dispute with his wife.  After they 
exchanged blows, he went to a friend who offered him the drug.  He took the drug, returned home, and was arrested by the police.  He was charged with being 
under the influence of drugs and with spousal abuse.  He plead guilty to spousal abuse and was sentenced to serve 20 days in jail, probation, a fine and to attend 
anger management courses.  He fulfilled all the requirements of his sentence and the criminal charges were dismissed.  (Government Exhibit 3 at 5. Also 
Government Exhibits 5, 6 and 7.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant did not use crystal methamphetamine again until the Summer of 2001.  According to the Applicant, his wife urged him to use crystal 
methamphetamine to help their marital relationship.  He used it approximately ten times over a two month span.  He has not used the drug since then and he and 
his wife are separated and getting a divorce.  (Government Exhibit 5 at 3-4.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in conduct which shows questionable judgment, unreliability, dishonesty, or unwillingness ro 
comply with rules or regulations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has held a security clearance since 1990.  He had knowledge of the Government's prohibitions concerning drug use while holding a security 
clearance when he used crystal methamphetamine in 1997 and 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline H (Drug involvement)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) any drug abuse;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) the drug involvement was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) the drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(5) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including the violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(5) the individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of drug and spousal abuse that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has abused illegal drugs and been involved in a drug 
related incident (Guideline H); and that he used drugs while holding a security clearance, which conduct indicates poor judgment, untrustworthiness and 
unreliability by the Applicant (Guideline E).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.  The evidence shows that the Applicant used drugs in two short periods 
seven years apart.  The last use was over three years ago.  He is remorseful for his conduct, and expresses an intent not to abuse drugs in the future.  There is no 
allegation of falsification and his sworn statement is an in depth discussion of his situation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the facts of this case Disqualifying Conditions 1 applies (<EM>any drug abuse</EM>).  However, due to the nature and extent of the use discussed above, Mitigating 
Factors 1 (<EM>the drug involvement was not recent)</EM>; 2 (<EM>the drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event</EM>); and 3 (<EM>a demonstrated intent not to abuse any 
drugs in the future</EM>)<EM> </EM>also apply.  Guideline H is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The decision to use illegal drugs while holding a security clearance was a very foolish one for the Applicant to make.  In his Additional Information statement 
submitted on July 14, 2004, he says, "I rue the day that I took illicit drugs and expressed anger on my spouse.  I am extremely remorseful for these actions."  
Disqualifying Factor 5 under Guideline E is most applicable to this allegations (<EM>a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including the violation of any written 
or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency</EM>).  However, under the particular facts of this case, Mitigating Factor 5 also applies (<EM>the 
individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress</EM>).  Guideline E is found for the 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, application of the general policy factors (whole person concept) is appropriate and supports a decision in the Applicant's favor.  The Applicant is 
motivated to continue his sobriety (factor g.), he shows considerable evidence of rehabilitation (factor f.), and, under the circumstances of this case, the 
probability that the Applicant will return to using drugs virtually nil (factor i.).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  
Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the 
Government's Statement of Reasons.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
