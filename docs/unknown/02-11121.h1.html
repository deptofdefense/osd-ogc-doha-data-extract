<P>The Applicant has either entered a settlement for, or has paid off, all of his past due indebtedness.  He now has a monthly positive cash flow of $860.00 each 
month.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 28, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on July 29, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on September 18, 2002.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on October 3, 2002, and Applicant's Response was received on November 27, 2002.  The case was received 
by the undersigned for resolution on December 12, 2002.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's admitted past financial difficulties militate against 
the granting of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of Relevant Material and Applicant's Response.  The Applicant is 30 years 
of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant had about $18,400 in past due indebtedness (Government Exhibits (GXs) 5~7).  The genesis of this indebtedness was the break up with his 
fiancee, the resulting loss of her income (the Applicant and his fiancee lived on their combined income), and a two month period of unemployment in 1999 (GX 
4 at page 3, and GX 5 at pages 2, 4 and 6).  He has since addressed all of his past due indebtedness:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  The Applicant owed about $3,423 in past due indebtedness to a financial institution for a credit card debt (GX 3 at page 1).  In November of 2002, the 
creditor accepted a payment by the Applicant "as Settlement in Full" for this debt (Response at Exhibit 1).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b.  The Applicant owed about $1,638 in past due indebtedness to another financial institution (GX 3 at page 1).  Prior to the issuance of the SOR, this debt 
was "paid in full" (Response at Exhibits 2 and 3).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c.  The Applicant owed about $608 in past due indebtedness to a jeweler (GX 3 at page 2).  Prior to the issuance of the SOR, this debt was "Settled" (GX 3 at 
page 2, and Response at Exhibits 3 and 4).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d.  The Applicant owed about $8,426 in past due indebtedness to a credit union for a loan (GX 3 at page 2).  In November of 2002, this debt was satisfied (GX 
3 at page 2, and Response at Exhibits 5 and 6).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e.  The Applicant owed about $3,579 in past due indebtedness to the same credit union for a credit card debt (GX 3 at page 2).  In November of 2002, this 
debt was also satisfied (GX 3 at page 2, and Response at Exhibits 6 and 7).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f.  The Applicant owed about $181 in past due indebtedness to a utility company (GX 3 at page 2).  Prior to the issuance of the SOR, this debt was "paid in 
full" (Response at Exhibit 8).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.g.  The Applicant owed about $116 in past due indebtedness to a retailer (GX 3 at page 2).  Prior to the issuance of the SOR, this debt was "paid in full" 
(Response at Exhibit 9).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.h.  The Applicant owed about $496 in past due indebtedness to a local court for an unpaid ticket (GX 3 at page 2).  Prior to the issuance of the SOR, this debt 
was "paid in full" (GX 3 at page 2, and Response at Exhibit 10).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.i.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has a monthly positive cash flow of $860.00 each month.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion, however, 
the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own 
common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions exhaust 
the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Financial Considerations</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">6.  The individual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolved debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline F (financial considerations), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified 
information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Government must be able to place a high 
degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Due to the loss of his fiancee's income and a brief period of unemployment, the Applicant incurred about $18,400 in past due indebtedness, as evidenced by 
eight debts, which he was initially unable to address.  Prior to the issuance of the SOR, however, the Applicant either settled or paid in full five of the eight past 
due debts.  The remaining three debts have recently also been paid in full.  He has thus repaid all of his past due indebtedness, as required by the last mitigating 
condition under Financial Considerations, and now has a positive cash flow of $860 each month.  As the Applicant is now financially solvent, I conclude that 
his past financial considerations are not of present security significance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his alleged financial difficulties.  The Applicant has thus met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline F, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>
