<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's abuse of marijuana from January 1996 to February 2003 is not mitigated where he used marijuana after applying for a clearance in January 2002 
and stated a possible intent to continue to use marijuana during a subject interview in April 2003. Clearance denied.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant appeals the 30 December 2003 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="03-16483.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> recommending denial or revocation 
of Applicant's clearance because of drug abuse.  Applicant answered the SOR in January 2004 and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 8 
November 2004 and I convened a hearing on 8 December 2004. DOHA received the transcript 16 December 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR<A HREF="03-16483.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>; accordingly, I incorporate the admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 29-year-old test computer programmer for a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He has not previously had a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been a recreational marijuana abuser from January 1996, when he was in college, to February 2003, five years after graduating. He estimates he 
used marijuana 100-200 times during this time, in social settings.<A HREF="03-16483.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> On his 17 January 2002 clearance application (G.E. 1), he reported using marijuana 100 
times between January 1996 and January 2002, and MDMA(Ecstasy) twice between June 2000 and May 2001.  In addition, he used hallucinogenic mushrooms 
and LSD on one occasion each in December 2002. He usually got his marijuana from friends, but bought it from friends as many as ten times. He also bought 
the mushrooms, ecstasy, and LSD that he tried.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">During his 3 April 2003 subject interview, Applicant state "it is not impossible that I would take marijuana again in a social situation." (G.E. 3) He claims to 
have been unaware of the government's proscription of illegal drug use until after that interview. He contacted the agent to make a new statement of intent: "I 
no longer intend to use drugs and I am interested in getting some kind of drug treatment as a way of proving to the government that I am free of drugs. My 
intentions have changed as a result of reading on a government website about how the security agencies view the use of drugs. I was not aware of the 
government policy until I read this. I viewed the use of drugs as a crime like speeding which is not serious but now realize that the government considers it a 
serious security concern". (G.E. 2)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">At the hearing, Applicant testified he now recognizes the importance of remaining drug free both from a professional standpoint and the clearance perspective. 
He noted his current employer has a drug policy with random testing and acknowledged that he assumed that all his previous employers probably had similar 
drug policies that did not stop him from using drugs in the past.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The record contains no evidence of Applicant's work record or character.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classif</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ied information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines is</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Guideline H (Drug Involvement)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-16483.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline H and the Applicant has not mitigated the conduct. Applicant was a recreational abuser of marijuana 
form January 1996 to February 2003, well after his graduation from college. He experimented with drugs other than marijuana after college as well. The 
illegality of his drug use did not prevent him from using drugs. He continued his drug use after applying for a clearance in January 2002, and went so far as to 
intimate he would continue to use marijuana until he discovered the likely consequence of his continued drug use on his clearance. Now he foreswears future 
use.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewed as a whole, his drug use is recent and not infrequent or isolated. His use continued well past an age where it might be attributed to youthful immaturity 
and continued notwithstanding its illegality, bespeaking a lack of judgment inconsistent with access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant now vows to refrain from marijuana abuse because he now realizes how significant the government considers his occasional use, I find that 
vow neither credible nor sufficient to constitute a demonstrated intent to refrain from drug abuse in the future, particularly given the circumstances of 
Applicant's past use. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
