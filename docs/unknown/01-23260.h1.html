<P>Thirty-seven-year-old applicant with five convictions for drunk driving deliberately omitted information on his security clearance application concerning 
medical and mental health treatment for his alcohol problems and deliberately provided false information about his recent return to drinking alcohol to an agent 
investigating his security worthiness.  Finding is against Applicant on personnel security guidelines for alcohol consumption, criminal conduct, and personal 
conduct.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant, an employee of a defense contractor, applied for a security clearance.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), the federal agency 
tasked with determining an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information, declined to grant Applicant a clearance.  In accordance with the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="01-23260.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="01-23260.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 23 September 2002 detailing why a clearance was 
not granted and recommending Applicant's case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether the clearance should be denied/revoked.  In the 
SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant failed to meet the alcohol consumption (Guideline G), criminal conduct (Guideline J), personal conduct (Guideline E) 
personnel security guidelines of the Directive. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 22 October 2002.  The case was assigned to Administrative Judge John Erck on 8 November 2002 and was 
subsequently transferred to Administrative Judge Wilford Ross.  Judge Ross scheduled a hearing for 8 January 2003.  At the request of Applicant's counsel, 
Judge Ross granted a delay in the hearing on 3 January 2003 due to Applicant's medical condition.  The case was reassigned to me on 9 January 2003 and the 
case was postponed indefinitely while awaiting Applicant's recovery from surgery.  On 21 March 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  The Government's case consisted of four exhibits.  Applicant testified on his own 
behalf and submitted three exhibits.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 31 March 2003.</P> 
 
<P>At the hearing, the Government moved to amend the 8 April 2000 date reflected in the SOR &para;&para; 3.a., b., c., and d., to 5 April 2000.  Applicant did not object and 
the motion was granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 37-year-old storekeeper who works for a government contractor on an Air National Guard base.  Ex . 1 at 1, 2.  He is well-liked and is an 
excellent worker.  Exs. A, B, C.  He has been married over five years and has two children under the age of 3.  Tr. 25; Ex. 1 at 4.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant began drinking alcoholic beverages at the age of 15.  Ex. 2 at 1.  At times, he would drink up to 24 beers a night.  Ex. 2 at 1.  In June 1984, he was 
arrested for the misdemeanor of driving under the influence (first offense).  Ex. 4 at 7.  He was found guilty, paid fines, lost his license for six months, and was 
required to attend alcohol education classes.  Ex. 2 at 2.  In November 1984, Applicant was again arrested and charged with the misdemeanor of driving under 
the influence (first offense).  He pled guilty to the offense of operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (an infraction),  was convicted, paid fines, lost 
his license, and attended alcohol education classes.  Ex. 3at 2-3; Ex. 4 at 6. </P> 
 
<P>In May 1990, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle with an alcohol/blood concentration greater than .10 (1<SUP>st</SUP> offense).  He was 
convicted after a trial and was sentenced to 60 days in jail, which he served, paid a fine of $500, served a year on probation, and attended alcohol outpatient 
treatment weekly for several months.  Ex. 2 at 3; Ex. 4 at 5.  </P> 
 
<P>He was arrested in August 1994 for driving while intoxicated (1<SUP>st</SUP> offense), a misdemeanor.  He pled guilty, was given three years' probation, was fined $750, 
had his license revoked, and attended outpatient treatment three times a week for six months.  Ex. 4 at 4-5; Ex. 2 at 3-4.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant stopped using alcohol after his 1994 arrest.  He resumed consuming alcoholic beverages sometime around 1998.  Tr. 29.  He started off with one beer 
and progressed to drinking once a month and then more frequently.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant completed his security clearance application on 5 April 2000.  To question number 21, Applicant answered that he had never been charged with, or 
convicted of, any felony offenses.  Ex. 1 at 6.  To question number 24, Applicant answered that he had only been charged or convicted of one offense related to 
alcohol, his August 1994 arrest and subsequent conviction.  Ex. 1 at 7.  To question number 19, Applicant answered that he had consulted a mental health 
professional in the previous seven years but that the consultations involved only marital, family or grief counseling, when in fact he had received counseling for 
alcohol abuse.  Ex. 1 at 6.</P> 
 
<P>As a result of questions concerning answers on his security clearance application, a Defense Security Service agent interviewed Applicant.  On 25 January 
2001, Applicant completed a signed, sworn statement in which he claimed he "stopped using alcohol in Aug 94 and have not had any alcohol since."  Ex. 2 at 1.</P> 
 
<P>In March 2001, Applicant's wife became concerned that his drinking, which had resumed in 1998, was getting out of hand. Tr. 31.  He was drinking a 12-pack 
of beer three times a week.  Tr. 33.  She convinced Applicant to enter an outpatient  rehabilitation program.  Tr. 32.  Nevertheless, on 23 April 2001,  while 
enrolled in the program, Applicant was arrested and eventually indicted for driving while intoxicated (2<SUP>nd</SUP> offense), a felony.  Upon his plea of guilty, Applicant 
was convicted, placed on probation for five years, had his license revoked, and was required to complete four phases of an alcohol rehabilitation program.  Ex. 
3 at 1; Ex. 4 at 2-3. </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus 
or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations 
should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G-Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline G that Applicant consumed excessive amounts of alcohol to the point of intoxication from the age of 15 until 1994, 
and had been arrested multiple times for alcohol related incidents (SOR &para; 1.a.), and continued to consume excessive amounts of alcohol up to at least 
November 2001, resulting in an arrest and conviction for an alcohol related incident (SOR &para; 1.b.).  Under Guideline G, </SPAN>excessive alcohol consumption often 
leads to the  exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information due to carelessness.  Directive, &para; E2.A7.l.l.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence that Applicant was involved in alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the 
influence (DC 1), and in habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment (DC 5) up until 2001.  Applicant claims he has abstained 
from drinking alcohol for two years and has attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) programs on a regular basis.  This would suggest that Applicant has taken 
positive steps toward rehabilitation (MC 3) and there is no likelihood of recurrence (MC 2).  However, in light of Applicant's past history, two years without 
drinking is not sufficient to conclude that recurrence is unlikely.  After all, his last drunk driving incident occurred while he was enrolled in an alcohol 
rehabilitation program.  Furthermore, I am not convinced Applicant's alleged participation in AA amounts to weighty mitigation.  He admits he only goes when 
he feels the need to do so and does not know the prayer or any of the 12 steps in the program. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Even if I had found mitigating conditions 2 and 3 applicable, they 
do not outweigh the disqualifying conditions. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The finding is against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline J that Applicant was arrested and charged with drunk driving on five different occasions between 1984 and 2001.  
SOR &para;&para; 2.a., b., c., d., e.  </SPAN>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  Directive &para; 
E2.A10.1.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence that Applicant was arrested for, or convicted of, drunk-driving related offenses five times between 1984 
and 2001.  DC 1 and 2.  However, of the SOR is incorrect in alleging that the drunk driving offenses which are the subject of  &para;&para; 2.c. and 2.d. were felonies  The 
evidence supports a finding that Applicant was charged with, and convicted of, a felony only once-his 9 November 2001 conviction for driving drunk on 23 
April 2001.  SOR &para; 2.a.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Despite his numerous attempts at alcohol rehabilitation, I am not convinced Applicant has been successfully rehabilitated such as to warrant application of MC 
6.  No other mitigating conditions listed under Guideline J apply.  The findings is against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline E that Applicant falsified material facts on his security clearance application in answer to questions about his 
police record-felony offenses (SOR &para; 3.a.), his police record-alcohol/drug offense (SOR &para; 3.b.), his medical record (SOR &para; 3.c.), and his use of alcohol (SOR &para; 
3.d.).  The SOR also alleged Applicant made a false statement to a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent by claiming he had ceased drinking in August 1994.  
SOR &para; 3.e.  Under Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government failed to establish by substantial evidence that Applicant omitted relevant and material facts from question 21 on his personal security 
clearance application in relation to his felony arrests.  Applicant completed his security clearance application on 5 April 2000.  The evidence of record is that 
Applicant was not charged with a felony until 2001.  The finding is for Applicant on SOR &para; 3.a.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Likewise, I am convinced the evidence does not support a conclusion that Applicant deliberately omitted all of his drunk driving arrest, except the latest, in 
answering question 24.  I am convinced that Applicant was under the impression that he only had to list his arrests in the past seven years.  Most of the 
questions in that part of the security clearance application are limited to the past seven years.  The Finding is for Applicant on SOR &para; 3.b.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I am convinced that Applicant deliberately omitted information about his consultations with mental health professionals (question 19) and participation in 
alcohol rehabilitation programs (question 30) from his security clearance application.  DC 2.  Furthermore, Applicant deliberately provided false information to 
a DSS agent in connection with a security worthiness determination (DC 3), by claiming he had not consumed any alcohol since 1994.  The finding is against 
Applicant on SOR &para;&para; 3.c., d., e.</SPAN></P>
