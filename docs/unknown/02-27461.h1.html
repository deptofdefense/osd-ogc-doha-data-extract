<P>Applicant did not intentionally falsify her security clearance application concerning her arrest in 1994 and related job termination.  Clearance is granted.  </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On June 14, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 23, 2004, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned 
to the undersigned on November 23, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on December 16, 2004, scheduling the hearing for January 19, 2005.  At the hearing 
the Government presented six exhibits.  The Applicant presented four exhibits and testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on 
February 3, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 35 years old and is not a high school graduate.  She is employed as a Machine Operator by a defense contractor and is applying for a security 
clearance in connection with her employment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she intentionally falsified material 
aspects of her personal background during the clearance screening process.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86), dated February 11, 1999.  In response to question 23 (a), which asked, "Have 
you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense," the Applicant responded, "NO." <EM>(See</EM> Government Exhibit 1).  This was a correct response 
since the Applicant has never been charged with or convicted of a Felony offense. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same questionnaire at question 23 (b), asked the Applicant if she has ever been charged with or convicted of a firearms or explosives offense.  The 
Applicant responded, "NO."  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 1).  This was a correct response since the Applicant has never been charged with or convicted of a 
firearms or explosives offense. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 23(c) asked the Applicant if there were any charges pending against her for any criminal offense.  The Applicant answered, "NO." (<EM>See </EM>Government 
Exhibit 1).  This was a correct response since, at that time, the Applicant has no charges pending against her for any criminal offense.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 23(d) asked the Applicant if she had ever been charged with or convicted of any offense related to alcohol or drugs.  The Applicant answered, "NO."  
(<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 1).  This was a correct response since, at that time, the Applicant had never been charged with or convicted of any offense related to 
alcohol or drugs.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 23(e) asked the Applicant if in the last seven years has she been subject to a court marital or other disciplinary proceedings under the Uniform Code of 
ilitary Justice.  The Applicant answered, "NO."  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibit 1).  This was a correct response since the Applicant had never been in the military.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 23(f) asked the Applicant if in the last seven years, has she been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, 
c, d or e above.  The Applicant answered, "NO."  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibit 1).  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to list her arrest on December 21, 
1994 for Theft of Personal Property.  Again she explained that she thought the incident occurred outside of the seven year period.  (Tr. p. 21).  There was also 
some confusion on her part as to whether a citizens arrest is considered an arrest by the police, and whether she was required to list a citizens arrest in response 
to this question.  (Tr. p. 22).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 11 of the same security clearance application asked the Applicant to list her employment activities beginning with the present and working back seven 
years.  The Applicant failed to list her employment with Kids-R-Us from about October 1994 to December 1994.  She explained that she thought the incident 
occurred outside of the seven year period.  (Tr. p. 23).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 22, of the same security clearance application asked the Applicant (1) if she has ever been fired from a job, (2) quit a job after being told she'd be 
fired, (3) left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct, (4) left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory 
performance, (5) left a job for other reason under unfavorable circumstances.  The Applicant answered, "NO."  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to 
list the fact that she was terminated from her employment at Kids-R-Us on or about December 21, 1994 for Theft of Personal Property.  She thought the 
incident occurred outside of the seven year period.  There is also information that the Applicant was terminated from Kinko's.  The Applicant contends that she 
was never actually terminated from Kinko's.  She was accused of stealing copies, but she asserts that she never did.  She quit the job before the matter was 
investigated.  (Tr. pp. 24-25). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find that the Applicant did not intentionally conceal this information from the Government on her security clearance application.  She credibly testified that 
when she filled out the security clearance application she believed that her arrest in 1994, occurred outside of the seven years that she believed she was required 
to disclose.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Letters from the Applicant's supervisor, coworkers and friends all attest to the Applicant's high level of integrity, dependability and honesty.  The Applicant is 
noted for her wonderful personality, exemplary values, respectfulness and fortitude.  Her performance on the job is outstanding.  She is hard working, 
conscientious and ambitious.  She takes great pride in her work and always conducts herself in a professional manner.  (<EM>See </EM>Applicant's Exhibits A, B,C and D).  
</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of dishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant failed to list material facts on her security clearance application (Guideline 
E).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's 
conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I observed the Applicant's demeanor and evaluated her credibility.  With respect to the Applicant's failure to list her 1994 arrest and related job termination on 
her security clearance application, she stated that she mistakenly assumed that they occurred over seven years ago, and/or because she was not arrested by the 
police, but was subject to a citizens arrest was not sure if the arrest qualified as something she was required to list.  Furthermore, she had never completed a 
security clearance application before and did not take the time to research the arrest and determine exactly when it occurred.  I do not find that she intentionally 
tried to conceal this information from the Government.  I find that she was simply careless and unsophisticated when she filled out the application.  To 
corroborate her testimony, during her interview with the Defense Security Service, the Applicant told the agent about what happened to her while she worked at 
Kids-R-Us but she could not remember when the incident happened or all of the details.  She explained that she was only issued a citation.  She was never 
arrested by the police or taken to the police station.  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibit 3).  Hopefully she has learned that the she must be as accurate and as honest as 
possible in the future when she completes this document. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is important for the Applicant to know that the Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders.  It is a negative factor for 
security clearance purposes when an Applicant has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of his personal background.  In this instance, 
the Applicant did not intentionally conceal this derogatory information concerning her arrest and employment history from the Government.  It was obviously a 
careless mistake.  In this case, the Applicant has demonstrated that she is trustworthy, and does meet the eligibility requirements for access to classified 
information.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's case opposing her request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence 
supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    Subpara.  1.a.: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
