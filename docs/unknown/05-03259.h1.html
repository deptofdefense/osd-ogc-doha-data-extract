<P>Title 10 United States Code &sect; 986 prohibits Applicant from holding a security clearance based on his October 1997 felony conviction for committing a lewd act 
upon a minor, sentence of eight years in prison, and incarceration for approximately four years. Although he claims to be innocent, he was found guilty of 
sexually molesting his 12-year-old daughter.  Applicant's refusal to accept responsibility for his behavior does not support mitigation of the sexual behavior or

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On September 30, 2005, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated 
February 20, 1960, as amended and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleged security concerns under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline D, Sexual Behavior.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">October 19, 2005</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on February 
17, 2006.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A notice of hearing was issued on March 9, 2006, scheduling the hearing for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">March 30, 2006.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The hearing was conducted on that date. The 
government submitted five exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1-5 and admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own 
behalf, had one character witness and submitted no exhibits. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 10, 2006.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his SOR response, Applicant admits the allegations in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b but denies the allegation in 1.c and 2.a. Applicant's admissions are 
incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 48-year-old material coordinator who is employed with a Department of Defense contractor and is applying for a security clearance.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> He is 
divorced and has two children, a 23-year-old daughter and a 26-year-old son.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He has a general equivalency diploma.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From November 6, 1979 to June 15, 1993, he served on active duty in the United States Army achieving the rank of Sergeant (E-5). He was in the 
Transportation career field.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  On September 4, 1992, he received Article 15 nonjudicial punishment for Conspiracy in violation of Article 81, Uniform Code of 
ilitary Justice (UMCJ) and Altering Official Document in violation of Article 107, UCMJ.  He and six other service members conspired to produce fraudulent 
U.S. Army Logistics Management College Graduation certificates which were entered into their noncommissioned officer promotion points packets in order to 
increase their chances of advancing to a higher enlisted rank and pay grade.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  He received a suspended reduction to the grade of Specialist (E-4).<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 20, 1996, Applicant's 12-year-old daughter reported that he had been sexually molesting her. She stated that he fondled her privates with his hand on 
multiple occasions during the year and had attempted to have sexual intercourse with her.  His daughter reported this information to her mother, to the police, to 
a doctor during a medical evaluation after reporting the incidents, and to a mental health counselor during a taped interview.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 12, 1996, a criminal arrest warrant was issued against Applicant for criminal sexual conduct with a minor.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> On October 16, 1997, after a fully 
litigated trial, he was convicted of Committing a Lewd Act Upon a Minor and sentenced to eight years in prison.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  He was incarcerated from October 1997 to 
August 2001.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> He is registered as a sex offender.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  He did not receive counseling while incarcerated.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant appealed his conviction.  On  April 21, 1999, the South Carolina Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant states he is innocent of the charge. He claims that his ex-wife influenced his daughter to report that he sexually molested her.  He claims she was 
seeking revenge since he told her he wanted a divorce.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  He provided an unsworn statement from his daughter which recants her earlier testimony.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant 
requests a waiver from the Secretary of Defense.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been working for his current employer since March 2002.  He started out as a temporary worker but was hired as a full-time employee on June 
24, 2002.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  His employer testified on his behalf and also served as his personal representative.  He states Applicant is a very good worker.  He shows up to

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently

Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in 
this case are: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Guideline J, Criminal Conduct:  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Guideline D, Sexual Behavior: Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject 
the individual to coercion, exploitation, or duress or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable information 
about the person.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> <BR> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by 
the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  "Any 
doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for 
issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Smith Amendment</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On June 7, 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a Memorandum, Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances as 
mandated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. The memorandum provides policy guidance for the 
implementation of Section 1071 of that act.  The amendment was added to Title 10, United States Code, to add a new section (10 U.S.C. &sect; 986) that precludes 
the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense under specific circumstances.  The statutory mandate applies to any 
employee of a DoD contractor who is under consideration for the issuance or continuation of eligibility for access to classified information. The relevant 
provision of the statute that applies to this case is that a person who has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime and sentenced to 
imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, and was incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than one year is prohibited from holding a security 
clearance.<A HREF="05-03259.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> The statue provides that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Military Departments concerned may authorize a waiver of the 
prohibitions concerning criminal convictions.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline D, Sexual Behavior.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established its case under Guideline J.  In September 1992, Applicant was punished under Article 15, UCMJ for a violation of Article 81, 
Conspiracy and Article 107, Altering an Official Document.  He and several of his co-workers conspired to produce fraudulent training certificates in order to 
make them more competitive for promotion purposes.  In October 1997, after a fully litigated trial,  he was convicted of Committing a Lewd Act Upon a Child 
Under 16 and was sentenced to eight years in prison. As such, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1: (<EM>Allegations or admission of 
criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>) and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2: (<EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>)<EM> </EM>apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Title 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 applies with respect to Applicant's October 1997 conviction for Committing a Lewd Act Upon a Child Under 16, since he was convicted 
in a United States court, was sentenced to prison for more than one year, and served four years in a state prison. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The criminal conduct concern can be mitigated.  Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC)  E2.A10.1.3.1: (<EM>The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>) 
applies since Applicant's last criminal conduct occurred over ten years ago. However, I give this mitigating condition little weight since he fails to accept 
responsibility for his actions.  He proclaims his innocence and alleges his ex-wife influenced his daughter into filing a false report against him.  In response to 
the SOR, he presented a document which he claims is a letter from his daughter recanting her previous allegations of abuse.  The letter indicates the daughter 
falsely accused her father of molesting her because she did not want to live under his strict discipline. I give the letter no weight since it is unsworn and the 
daughter was not subject to cross-examination.  Furthermore, the doctrine of collateral estoppel prevents the Applicant from re-litigating his case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2: (<EM>The crime was an isolated incident</EM>) does not apply since Applicant has committed more than one criminal offense in the past.  
Specifically, the conduct while on active duty in the U.S. Army which was the basis of his punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, as well as his  multiple acts of 
sexual molestation of his daughter which occurred on multiple occasions over a one year period.  Although he has not committed any criminal offenses since 
being released from prison and has a favorable employment record, his failure to take responsibility for the offense as well as his failure to seek counseling does 
not support the notion that he is fully rehabilitated. As such, CC MC E2.10.1.3.6: (<EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>) does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I do not recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver in accordance with 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  I find against Applicant under Guideline J.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Sexual Behavior</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a prima facie case with respect to the sexual behavior concern.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant sexually molested his twelve-year-old daughter on multiple occasions over a one year period. Specifically, he fondled her private parts with his hands 
and attempted to have sexual intercourse with her.  He was subsequently convicted of a felony offense after a fully litigated trial. Sexual Behavior Disqualifying 
Conditions (SB DC) E2.A4.1.2.1: (<EM>Sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted</EM>) and E2.A4.1.2.4 (<EM>Sexual behavior 
of a public nature and/or that which reflects lack of discretion or judgment</EM>) apply to his case.  Although the sexual behavior was not of a public nature, it 
certainly demonstrates a lack of discretion and judgment.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sexual behavior concern can be mitigated. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply due to Applicant's refusal to accept responsibility for his actions.  I 
find against Applicant under Guideline D.   <STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>
