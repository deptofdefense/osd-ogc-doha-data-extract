<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 3 December 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="02-32597.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in a writing notarized on 26 December 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative 
judge.  The case was assigned to me on 3 February 2004.  On 24 March 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 5 April 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 38-year-old software engineer for a defense contractor.  By all accounts, he is a hardworking, skilled, reliable, and honest employee who, over an 
approximately 10-year period, possessed a security clearance without any adverse security incidents.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant was unemployed between November 2001 and June 2002.  On 22 February 2002, Applicant had an argument with his girlfriend, who was living with 
him.  The argument escalated into a physical confrontation involving pulling of hair and slapping.  Applicant's girlfriend, who was wearing only socks on her 
feet at the time, struck her head when she slipped and fell.  Applicant left his house, went to a neighbor's house, and called the local police.  The police arrested 
Applicant and charged him with harassment and third degree assault.  He spent the night in "the facility" and was released the following day.  Tr. 129.  
Applicant pled guilty to third degree assault-recklessly causing injury-and the harassment charge was dismissed.  Ex. 5 at 1.  On 25 February 2002, he was 
granted a deferred sentence of 180 days in jail.  The sentence was suspended and he was placed on unsupervised probation for 24 months.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 2.  </P> 
 
<P>On 23 June 2002, for his new position with the defense contractor, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Position (QNSP).  Ex. A.  
Question 23 asked Applicant to answer a number of questions concerning his police record.  Applicant answered "no" to all of the questions including the last 
one (23(f))-if in the past seven years, he had "been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not listed in response to" questions 23(a)-23(e).  
Applicant submitted the form to the facility security officer (FSO), who entered the information from the form into her computer and printed off a security 
clearance application (SCA), dated 9 July 2002.  Ex. 1.  Applicant signed the SCA.  Question 26 asked Applicant if the in the previous seven years he had 
"been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed" in answers to other questions on the SCA.  Applicant answered "no."  Both question 
23 of the QNSP and question 26 of the SCA contained similar language indicating applicants were to "report information regardless of whether the record in 
your case has been 'sealed' or otherwise stricken from the record."</P> 
 
<P>On 10 February 2004, in light of his successful completion of the probation and domestic violence counseling (Tr. 134-35), the charge was officially dismissed 
by the court.  Ex. B.  </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was arrested for assault and harassment in February of 2002 and pled guilty to third degree assault.  A history or pattern 
of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government established, by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions, the allegation contained in the SOR.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Admissions of criminal conduct could 
raise a security concern.  DC E2.A10.1.2.1.  But the criminal behavior was not recent-the offense occurred over two years ago (MC E2.A10.1.3.1.); the crime 
appears to be an isolated incident (MC E2.A10.1.3.2.); and there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation-Applicant completed the required domestic 
violence counseling and probation without adverse incident (MC E2.A10.1.3.6.).  I find for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified material facts on his SCA by deliberately failing to disclose his arrest for and conviction of assault.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct 
involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could 
indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government established <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that he should have listed the arrest for and conviction of third degree assault 
on his QNSP and SCA.  But to be a disqualifying condition, Applicant's failure to list the arrest and conviction must have been deliberate.  Applicant argues 
that he misunderstood the question (Answer), he was advised by the district attorney (DA) with whom he negotiated his plea agreement that it should not affect 
his security clearance (Tr. 132, 134), and that he was specifically advised by his FSO that he did not have to list the criminal incident in his QNSP (Tr. 139).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits taking the QNSP home to work on it because he did not want to be rushed.  Tr. 137.  His claim that he stumbled over question 23(f) is 
inconsistent with his assertion that the DA told him his plea agreement would not affect his security clearance.  If the DA had made such a statement, Applicant, 
who had almost 10 years of dealing with security clearances, would know better than to rely on representations concerning security clearances made by 
someone who is not a federal employee.  And if the DA had made such representations and Applicant actually believed them, he should have completed the 
questions without any reservations or stumbling.  Tr. 137.  Applicant does not assert the DA told him he did not have to report the conviction on his QNSP.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's claim he relied on the FSO's opinion that he did not have to list the arrest and conviction is undermined by his own testimony and contradicted by 
the FSO.  Under cross-examination, Applicant admitted he may have misled the FSO by not revealing to her he had been arrested, charged, pled guilty, and 
convicted.  Tr. 158.  It is just not credible that an applicant of his age, education, and experience would rely on the FSO's advice knowing he had not disclosed 
to her the full nature of the incident.  More importantly, the FSO denied she ever gave or would give such advice.  Her practice is to tell applicants who are 
unsure how much to disclose everything up front.  After considering all of the evidence and closely observing the demeanor of the witnesses, I find the FSO 
was credible and Applicant was not.  I conclude Applicant deliberately falsified his QNSP and SCA by failing to disclose his arrest and conviction.  DC 
E2.A5.1.2.2.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  Applicant still refuses to acknowledge his deliberate falsification.  I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
