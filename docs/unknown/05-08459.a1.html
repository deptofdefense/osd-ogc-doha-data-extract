<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On November 3, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 12, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge 
LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether four of the Administrative Judge's findings of fact were erroneous; and whether the Administrative 
Judge erred by concluding that the security concerns raised under Guideline F had not been mitigated.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant contends that the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised by his history of financial difficulties had not been 
mitigated.  In support of that contention, Applicant argues that his financial problems were isolated and not recent, and they were due to circumstances beyond 
his control--his parents' medical problems and his temporary loss of employment.  Applicant also argues that several of the Judge's findings are erroneous, in 
that they are only partially correct or take matters out of context.  The Board does not find Applicant's contentions persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>The findings of fact which Applicant challenges are permissible characterizations by the Administrative Judge and each is supported by relevant evidence.  
Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge's material findings with respect to Applicant's conduct of security concern do not reflect a 
reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge's material findings of security concern are 
sustainable.<A HREF="05-08459.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In this case, the Administrative Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial obligations.  At the time the case was submitted for 
decision, Applicant still had over $40,000 in unpaid credit card debt.  He had not made any efforts to resolve, compromise, or pay his delinquent debts even 
after he had started a new job.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge reasonably concluded that Applicant's financial problems were still ongoing.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case 
No. 03-26213 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 23, 2006).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the 
disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge articulated a rational basis for not applying the 
potential mitigating conditions in this case, and reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to 
overcome the government's security concerns.  The Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to 
demonstrate the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  <EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  
Given the record that was before him, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline F is sustainable.  Thus, the Administrative Judge did 
not err in denying Applicant a clearance.</P>
