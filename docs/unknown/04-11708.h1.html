<P>Between 2002 and 2005, Applicant incurred approximately $15,286 in delinquent debt. She has paid off four of the debts and is making timely payments on another account.  However,  she still has 
approximately $10,000 of debt that is either delinquent or she has trouble paying. She has no comprehensive plan for dealing with the remaining debt.  I find Applicant did not intentionally falsify her

<P>On August 17, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust - an ADP I/II/III position. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application 
under Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program, </EM>(Jan 1987), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program </EM>(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On July 25, 2005, DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which 
is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under </SPAN>Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement dated </SPAN>September 19, 2005<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN>The case was assigned to me on May 24, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A notice of hearing was issued on

admitted without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted 15 exhibits which were marked and admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-N. The record was held open until August 1, 
2006. Applicant timely submitted a 69 page exhibit that was admitted without objection as AE O. </SPAN>DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 28, 2006.</P>

<P>Since 2002, Applicant has struggled financially and personally.  Her father was diagnosed with cancer in May 2002.  During his illness she would often drive to his home located in a nearby state to take 
care of him. He passed away on July 22, 2003.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Her father would occasionally help her out with finances. Applicant's grandmother lived with her for the last six years of her life. Applicant's oldest 
daughter had a job taking care of her grandmother. Her grandmother passed away on July 18, 2004.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  When her grandmother passed away, her oldest daughter became unemployed.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  This caused an 
additional financial burden. In the wintertime, her two daughter's work schedules are cut to part-time hours due to the seasonal nature of the employment in the area where they reside. They rely on 
Applicant for much of their expenses in the winter months.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>In August 2004, Applicant sought treatment for Depression and has taken prescription medication since that time.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  She has also been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, and high 
cholesterol.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Some time between 2001 to 2004, she was on paid sick leave for six weeks.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant intends to pay off all of her accounts.  She has paid the debts alleged in SOR &para;&para;  1.a, 1.b, 1.h and 1.i.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  She has payment plans with the creditors in SOR &para;&para; 1.e and 1.h.  She makes payments 
on both of these accounts.  The payments to the debt in SOR &para; 1.e appear to be made on a sporadic basis.  She agreed to pay $75 per month.  The record evidence indicates payments were made on 
November 22, 2005, January 30, 2006, April 3, 2006, April 28, 2006 and June 26, 2006.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>She agreed to pay $65 a month towards the debt in SOR &para; 1.f.  The record evidence indicates payments were made on April 20, 2004, February 9, 2005 and February 2, 2006.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> Her  recent credit reports 
indicate that the account is up-to-date.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  </P> 
 
<P>Although Applicant intends to pay all her debts, she has no plans for settling the debts alleged in SOR &para;&para; 1.d and 1.g.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> She disputes the $558 debt alleged in SOR &para; 1.b. She claims she agreed to pay 
$59.99 for an extended warranty.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> There were several other delinquent debts not alleged in the SOR.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  They include a $3,834 Mastercard account;<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> a $582 charged off account from a bank;<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> and a 
$1,160 department store account.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  It appears that she is paying on these accounts.  For instance she is paying $33 a month on the Mastercard account.  However, the minimal payment she is paying is 
less than the $81 finance charge imposed by the creditor making it difficult to reduce the balance.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>   She has also resolved several accounts that were not alleged in the SOR.  Among them a $292 
jewelry store account<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> and a $244 account with a women's clothing store<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant attempted to consolidate her debts. She contacted several credit counselors who told her that she could not consolidate her bills because she has a mobile home.  She also consulted a credit 
counselor through her employer but claims that she was no help.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> Her monthly take home pay is approximately $1,200 and can be higher if she works overtime.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> She is renting to own her mobile 
home. Her mortgage is $501.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> After the bills are paid, she has no money left over.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> She did not provide a copy of her current budget. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 17, 2004, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85-P).<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  In response to question "22b. Your Financial Record - Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any 
loan or financial obligation? Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal Government." she answered, "Yes," and listed a personal bank loan. She did not list any other delinquent 
debts.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>In her answer to the SOR, Applicant denies that she falsified material facts in response to question 22b on her Questionnaire for Public Trust Position Application (SF 85 P) dated August 14, 2004. 
Question 22b asks "Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation?" Applicant listed a personal loan which is alleged in SOR &para; 1.e but did not list other debts which were 
over 180 days delinquent.  Applicant did not list the debts because she did not think the debts were 180 days delinquent since she sent in payments to different creditors. At the time she filled out the 
application, she had just been diagnosed with depression.  Her mind was on other things since she had recently lost her grandmother and had lost her father the previous year.<A HREF="04-11708.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> </P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. I make the following conclusions.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations </STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>); and FC DC 3 E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>Inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts) </EM>apply to Applicant's case.  Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations since 2002.  Although she has paid off several of her delinquent debts, 
approximately $5,344 remains delinquent. She has had trouble paying other debts as well, which total approximately $5,576. She has no money left over each month after expenses. At this time, it 
appears, she is unable to satisfy her remaining debts.</P> 
 
<P>I considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC).  Although she has paid off several of her debts, she still has difficulty meeting her financial obligations. Therefore, I cannot 
apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The behavior was not recent</EM>), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>The behavior was isolated</EM>) because she still carries a significant amount of delinquent debt.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, 
divorce, or separation)</EM>) applies, in part. From 2002 to 2003, Applicant spent a lot of time driving back and forth to her father's home after he was diagnosed with cancer.  This added a further expense to 
her budget. The loss of her father in 2003 and grandmother in 2004 caused great emotional strain which may have made it difficult to concentrate on her finances. It placed an additional financial burden 
on Applicant since she lost her father's financial assistance and her daughter became unemployed temporarily and relied on Applicant for support. </P>

<P>I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem  is being resolved or under control</EM>) because 
although Applicant consulted with a credit counselor, she did not really attend a formal program.  She has paid off several of her accounts, but, it does not appear that her financial problems are under 
control.  She still has several debts which remain unresolved.  Applicant did not have an organized plan to deal with the remaining unresolved accounts.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) is applicable, in part.  Applicant resolved four of her delinquent accounts.  She is 
making payments on several other accounts.  No attempts have been made to resolve other accounts although she intends to resolve these debts in the future.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has made a good start towards resolving her delinquent accounts.  However, a concern remains that Applicant will encounter financial problems in the future.  She has no extra income after 
her monthly expenses are paid.  She does not appear to have an established plan to deal with the remaining debt.  She does not have a monthly budget in place. Based on Applicant's past financial 
history, it is too soon to conclude that her financial situation will be resolved. She has failed to mitigate the concern under Guideline F.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>Although her evidence of rehabilitation is insufficient at this time this decision should not be construed as a determination that Appellant can not or will not attain the state of true reform and 
rehabilitation necessary to justify the granting of a trustworthiness determination.  Should Appellant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a trustworthiness determination in the future and she were 
able to arrange a satisfactory repayment plan with her creditors to repay her delinquent accounts and pay her debts, she may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of trustworthiness.  Since she has not 
attempted to resolve several of her delinquent accounts, it is premature to grant her a trustworthiness position.  The Financial Considerations concern is resolved against Applicant.   </P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard 
classified information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security clearance or in 
other official matters is a security concern.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  </P> 
 
<P>In this case, the record evidence fails to establish Applicant deliberately omitted or concealed information about her delinquent debts.  Although her answer to question 22b was incorrect, Applicant 
successfully rebutted the allegations that she deliberately provided a false answer.  I find credible her explanation that she did not believe any of her debts were over 180 days old when she filled out her 
security clearance application.  She did not believe they were delinquent since she was making payments towards her debts.  At the time she filled out her trustworthiness questionnaire, she had been just 
recently diagnosed with depression. She was grieving the recent loss of her grandmother as well as the loss of her father the previous year.  Her mind was on other things. I find that she did not intend to 
falsify her security clearance application. Guideline E is decided for Applicant.<STRONG> </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the 
"whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into 
consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the evidence and the "whole person" in evaluating Applicant's trustworthiness. An applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage in conduct that has negative 
trustworthiness implications. Although Applicant's loyalty to the United States is not in question, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence that she failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns 
regarding Guideline F, and that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.</P>
