<P>Applicant, a 61-year-old systems analyst, had one job-related drinking incident in 2001 and one DWI in 2003. Although he has twice stopped drinking, 
Applicant continues to drink at a lower level of consumption. Applicant has not mitigated the government's security concerns regarding his alcohol 
consumption. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On May 9, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, of the Directive. DOHA recommended the case be referred 
to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. </P> 
<P>On June 7, 2005, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. He requested a hearing. This matter was assigned to me on August 1, 2005. A 
first notice of hearing was issued on August 18, 2005, scheduling a hearing for September 14, 2005. Applicant's counsel filed a timely Motion to Reschedule 
the Hearing Date, which was granted by Order dated September 9, 2005. An amended notice of hearing was issued on September 13, 2005, and a hearing was 
held on September 26, 2005. Government Exhibits 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence. Applicant Exhibits A through J were admitted into evidence. Two 
witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant, who also testified. The hearing transcript was received on October 17, 2005.</P>

</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. An administrative judge need 
not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when 
applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the adjudicative process provision in Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive, are intended to assist the 
administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. </P> 
<P>Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. In addition, each security clearance 
decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. 
Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of 
the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for </P> 
<P>or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy 
guidance.</P> 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="04-06549.h1.html#N_63_"><SUP> (63)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-06549.h1.html#N_64_"><SUP> (64)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="04-06549.h1.html#N_65_"><SUP> (65)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against him.<A HREF="04-06549.h1.html#N_66_"><SUP> (66)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-06549.h1.html#N_67_"><SUP> (67)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="04-06549.h1.html#N_68_"><SUP> (68)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="04-06549.h1.html#N_69_"><SUP> (69)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="04-06549.h1.html#N_70_"><SUP> (70)</SUP></A> Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be " in terms of the national 
interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned." The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.<A HREF="04-06549.h1.html#N_71_"><SUP> (71)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
<P><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption - Guideline G: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to 
control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</STRONG></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the 
allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline G. Based on all the evidence, Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) E2.A7.1.2.1. 
(<EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to 
alcohol use</EM>), AC DC E2.A7.1.2.2. (<EM>Alcohol -related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking 
on the job</EM>), and AC DC E2.A7.1.2.5. (<EM>Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment</EM>) apply in this case. Applicant's DWI arrest 
and subsequent conviction qualify as an alcohol-related incident away from work. Prior to his arrest, he had reported to work smelling of alcohol, an alcohol-related work incident. Once it learned of his behavior, Applicant's employer required him to attend alcohol counseling and AA. </P> 
<P>In addition to the above incidents, the evidence reflects a pattern of habitual drinking since 1990. After work, Applicant usually drank several scotches. His 
level of consumption increased on the weekends to include daytime drinking. Over time, his weekday consumption increased to include daytime drinking. 
Although he stopped drinking twice, he resumed his pattern of consuming alcohol in 2002 and again 2004, this time limiting his drinking to after work three or 
more times a week.</P> 
<P>The government asserts that AC DC E2.A7.1.2.3. (<EM>Diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence</EM>) and AC DC 
E2.A7.1.2.6. (<EM>Consumption of alcohol subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed medial professional and following completion of an alcohol 
rehabilitation program</EM>) apply because Applicant admitted to alcohol dependence in his answer to allegations 1.d, 1.e and 1.f of the SOR. I find that these 
disqualifying conditions do not apply in this case. In its pleading, the government alleged alcohol dependence, but failed to allege that a credential professional 
made this diagnosis. Based on the government's pleading, Applicant admitted to alcohol dependence only. He did not admit to a diagnosis of alcohol 
dependence by a credentialed medical professional. There is no evidence of any competent diagnosis of alcoholism (or alcohol dependence) in the record.</P> 
<P>I considered all the Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions (AC MC) and conclude that none apply in this case. Applicant's alcohol consumption is 
recent. His DWI occurred a mere two years ago. Despite two periods of abstinence, he continues to drink regularly and at a significant level. While he need not 
totally abstain from the use of alcohol, his pattern of drinking many nights in local bars raises serious security concerns, particularly in light of his admission 
that he is an alcoholic and his past alcohol-related problems. Although he no longer drinks in the morning or drives when he intends to drink, he does not view 
his ongoing and regular consumption of alcohol as problematic enough to quit. In fact, once he thought that his security issues related to the DWI had been 
resolved, he decided he could resume drinking. His efforts to reduce the quantity of alcohol he consumes are admirable. However, his reduction in his drinking 
volume is not enough to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drinking.</P> 
<P>Finally, I also considered "the whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. For many years, he 
drank within moderation. When he began to encounter high levels of stress and problems related to his marriage and his work plus family deaths, he drank, 
often to excess. At this time, he does not drink at work. His performance reviews have been excellent and his co-workers consider him trustworthy. 
Nonetheless, his continued and frequent drinking outside of work poses a serious risk to security. He does not recognize the problems which can result from his 
behavior. He does not  accept the fact that he has a problem with alcohol nor does he recognize the potential impact his conduct could have on protecting the 
national interests. I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated or overcome the government's case under Guideline G. Accordingly, for the reasons stated, I find 
that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant.</P>
