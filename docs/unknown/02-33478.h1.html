<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 8 September 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-33478.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 20 February 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case 
was assigned to me on 21 January 2004.  On 10 February 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 19 February 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Without objection from Applicant, I granted Department Counsel's motion to amend the allegation in SOR &para; 1.b. to reflect Applicant asked "at least one 
employee" of the concrete company to provide false information rather than "two employees."</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor working as an assistant in the security office.  From 1982-88, she served in the U.S. Army Reserve, 
obtaining the pay grade of E-4.  She was married in 1985 and now has two children.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was born and raised in State 1.  In 1998, Applicant, her husband, and children moved to State 2, where she found employment with a defense 
contractor.  In 1999, she completed a security clearance application (SCA).  Before completing the SCA, Applicant discussed with her husband how she was 
going to answer question 6-her employment activities-for the period 1989-98.  She did not want to reveal her father and brother paid her a weekly allowance 
for performing "various odd jobs," including babysitting her brother's children.  Ex. B at 2.  Applicant had asked JD, a friend in State 1, if she could use her as 
a personal and work reference to confirm, if asked, that she was Applicant's supervisor at a concrete company from 1989-98.  Ex. B at 4.  Applicant never 
worked at that company.  Applicant listed the friend as a reference.  On 14 February 2000, Applicant was granted a secret clearance.</P> 
 
<P>In August 2000, Applicant completed another SCA as part of the process required to upgrade her clearance to top secret.  She answered question 6 as she had in 
her 1999 SCA, claiming she had worked for JD at the concrete company from 1989-98.  Sometime thereafter, JD telephoned Applicant to notify her that a 
Defense Security Service (DSS) agent was going to interview her (JD) about Applicant's security clearance.  When Applicant was confronted by the DSS agent, 
she admitted she had not worked for JD or the concrete company.  Tr. 28.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant performed all of her assigned duties for the defense contractor in an excellent or superior manner.  Ex. A.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant (1) deliberately falsified her SCA by stating she was employed by the concrete company when, in fact, she was 
performing odd jobs for her father and brother (&para; 1.a.) , and (2) asked at least one individual to provide false information to any investigator inquiring about 
Applicant's employment history (&para; 1.b.) .  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that Applicant knowingly and deliberately falsified relevant and material facts 
on her SCA.  DC E2.A5.1.2.2.  Applicant knew a DSS agent would contact her former employers.  Tr. 43.  She contends she was physically and mentally 
abused by her father and brother.  They were angry with her for moving to State 2, and she was concerned about what they would say about her if interviewed 
by a DSS agent.  But that is hardly a valid reason for lying on her SCA.  Applicant no longer lived near her father or brother and there is no evidence Applicant 
was under any physical threat of coercion.  Such concealment of information increased her vulnerability to coercion or exploitation.  DC E2.A5.1.2.4.  She also 
admits asking a friend to lie about Applicant's employment history, which is reliable unfavorable information about Applicant.  DC E2.A5.1.2.1; E2.A5.1.2.4.  
Applicant took positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate her vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress by admitting her deliberate falsification to 
the DSS agent and at the hearing.  MC E2.A5.1.3.5.  However, her admission only occurred after she knew the DSS agent had discovered her lie and confronted 
her about it.  None of the other mitigating conditions apply to this case.  After carefully considering all of the evidence, I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant committed a felony, a violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001, by deliberately falsifying her SCA.  &para; 2.a.  A history or pattern of 
criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the 
Executive Branch of the Government of the United States.  18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the 
Government of the United States.  <EM>See Egan</EM> at 484 U.S. at 527.  Applicant deliberately lied about her employment history on her SCA which she certified as 
"true, complete, and correct" to the best of her knowledge and belief, and with an understanding that knowing and wilful false statements were a violation of 18 
U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  An applicant may be disqualified if allegations of criminal conduct are raised against her.  DC E2.A10.1.2.1.  The criminal offense was not an 
isolated incident (MC E2.A10.1.3.2)-she deliberately falsified the 1999 SCA as well.  After weighing all the evidence is this case against the disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions, I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P>In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
