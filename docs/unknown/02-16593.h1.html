<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant under Executive Order 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (the "Directive").  On December 3, 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision: security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Applicant answered the SOR by 
letter on January 18, 2004.<A HREF="02-16593.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel submitted the government's written case on May 27, 2004.  Department Counsel provided a complete copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM) to Applicant, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  
Applicant received the FORM on June 25, 2004.  Applicant submitted additional information for consideration, an unsworn statement, dated July 2, 2004.  This 
case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on August 6, 2004.  However, because of caseload consideration, the case was reassigned to me on February

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admitted in part each of the factual allegations contained in the SOR and offered mitigating circumstances. Those admissions are incorporated herein 
as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The first three-quarters of Applicant's tuition was paid by a university in PRC.  His tuition was about $5,000.00, which was in the form of a loan from the 
World Bank; he also received $300.00 per month for living expenses for about one year.<A HREF="02-16593.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  The first year that he was in the U.S., he had contact with the

not receive a response.<A HREF="02-16593.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  He feels no further obligation regarding the money he received from PRC and he would refund the money if asked.<A HREF="02-16593.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant became a naturalized United States citizen on June 8, 2000.  He has been divorced twice.  Both of his ex-wives were born in PRC.<A HREF="02-16593.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Currently, his

the record that either of his parents has connections to the Chinese government, military, or security services.  Applicant states about his parents that "my 
parents are both retired long time ago and are leading their late years of their private life.  During their whole lifetime, they have never been involved in any 
political activities or never been agents of any government power.  They are not in any position, which could be exploited by any foreign power."<A HREF="02-16593.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has visited his family in PRC during the following periods: two or three weeks from December 2002 to January 2003; three weeks in October 2000; 
three weeks in December 1999; and one month in 1986.<A HREF="02-16593.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

and security risk management at DOE.<A HREF="02-16593.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  Applicant opined that "I understand if I run into a situation where someone tries to use my extended family 
members-identified by him as his parents, brothers, and sister-as hostages for the ransom of information concerning national security of United States, I would 
not be the only one to deal with it.  I will have my government[s] [sic] stand next to me to help me and help me to make the right decisions."<A HREF="02-16593.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth Adjudicative Guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the Adjudicative Guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke 
an individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline B - Foreign Influence:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Directive</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">paragraph E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An administrative judge need not view the Adjudicative Guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in Section E2.2, Adjudicative Process, of the Directive, are intended to assist 
the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial decisions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person" concept, all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The adjudicative process factors which an 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, paragraph E2.2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government 
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation, or mitigation 
sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue the applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated on trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  Because of this special relationship, the government must be able 
to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, 
by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions 
are predictive in nature and must often address potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that 
industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B, Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A2.1.2.1 of the Directive provides that it may be a disqualifying condition if "an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual 
has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country."  Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1 defines "immediate family 
members" to include a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.  Applicant has immediate family members-his parents, two brothers, and a 
sister-who are citizens and residents of China.  Applicant maintains telephone contact with this parents about five or six times per year; he has infrequent 
contact with his siblings.  Pursuant to paragraph</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">these circumstances "could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the 
compromise of classified information."  While the-</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mere possession of family ties with persons in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, automatically disqualifying . . . [it] does raise a prima facie security 
concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the applicant.  ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 at **33-34 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude this potentially disqualifying condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Similarly, pursuant to paragraph</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2.3</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> it may be disqualifying where "[r]elatives . . . are connected with any foreign government."  The record in this 
case does not indicate that any of Applicant's family in PRC are connected with the government of PRC.  Thus, I find this potentially disqualifying condition 
does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the Directive at paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1, the security concerns arising from possible foreign influence may be mitigated under certain circumstances.  
These security concerns may not be disqualifying where it is determined that "the immediate family members . . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a 
position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United States."  
Applicant states about his parents that "my parents are both retired long time ago and are leading their late years of their private life.  During their whole 
lifetime, they have never been involved in any political activities or never been agents of any government power.  They are not in any position, which could be 
exploited by any foreign power."<A HREF="02-16593.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A>  He reiterated the following about his family in PRC-</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have my parents, my brothers, and my sister being citizens and residing in the People's Republic of China.  None of them are any agents of any foreign power.  
None of them are in a position either financially or politically could be exploited by any foreign power in a way that could force me to choose between loyalty 
to them and the</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">United States.  My contacts with them are minimal because I cannot in any way to provide much more help to them (except my parents).<A HREF="02-16593.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">None of Applicant's relatives are employees or officers of the government.<A HREF="02-16593.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A>  There is no evidence indicating any one of them is an "agent of a foreign 
power."<A HREF="02-16593.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has extensive ties to the United States.  Applicant has lived in the U.S. for the past 22 years.  His children are citizens and residents of the U.S.  He 
works at a profession that he enjoys here in the U.S.  Moreover, he has worked for defense contractors since graduating with his doctoral degree without any 
adverse incidents.  He has a house here in the U.S. and he has other financial investments here.  Moreover, Applicant says regarding disclosure of classified 
information that "[d]isclosure of classified material means to me that I have to risk my own career (I will lose of my job), my integrity (I took the oath and 
promise to safe guard all the sensitive/classified information), and even my own personal life (without a job, personal wealth I will have no life)."<A HREF="02-16593.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A>  
Considering the extent of his ties to the United States, I find Applicant is not vulnerable to pressure or duress through his relatives in PRC.  I conclude the 
mitigating condition set out in paragraph E2A2.1.3.1 of the Directive applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I considered carefully all the facts and circumstances in this case in light of the "whole person" concept.  Applicant is a mature individual who has spent the 
majority of his adult life in the United States.  The personal, professional, and economic ties that bind him to the United States far outweigh his connections 
with relatives in PRC.  I conclude Applicant has mitigated any potential security concerns arising from Applicant's family ties in PRC.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P>
