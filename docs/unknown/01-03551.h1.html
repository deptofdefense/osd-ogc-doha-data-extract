<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In November 1999, the Applicant was arrested for a serious misdemeanor--reckless endangerment.  Two hunters had trespassed over his land and he fired a shotgun in 
the air.  The Applicant's initial conviction was overturned on appeal and the matter is reset for retrial.  The Applicant regrets his actions, understands the mistake he made 
and feels remorse for his actions.  While the incident was serious due to risk of bodily harm posed to the hunters, it was isolated. Clearance is granted. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On February 28, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-03551.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On March 8, 2001, the Applicant 
answered the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on March 29, 2001.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on April 24, 2001, scheduling the 
hearing which was held on May 10, 2001. The Government's case consisted of five exhibits (Gov Ex).  The Applicant relied on his own testimony and six documents. 
(App Ex)  A transcript (tr) of the hearing was received on May 23, 2001. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The SOR alleges criminal conduct (Guideline J).  The Applicant admits the arrest, finding of guilt, and sentence but denies it cast doubt on his judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. </P> 
 
<P>The Applicant is 37-years-old and has worked for a defense contractor since August 1987. He is seeking to maintain the secret security clearance granted in January 
1988.  The Applicant is a most capable, hard working professional.  He is friendly, courteous, highly motivated, a problem solver, and an important asset. He has received 
recognition for his outstanding work. </P> 
 
<P>The Applicant and his girlfriend live in a rural area.  The Applicant's lot is 245 feet wide and 1800 feet long. (tr 18)  In November 2000, the Applicant's girlfriend woke 
him up and told him there were two hunters on their land.  The Applicant's girlfriend was concerned for their horses which are kept on the property. The Applicant quickly 
dressed and saw two hunters<A HREF="01-03551.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN> dressed in camouflage, carrying bows and arrows.  The Applicant's girlfriend had confronted the pair, told them there was no hunting or 
trespassing<A HREF="01-03551.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> on their land and advised them to leave the property immediately.  The pair responded by telling her they had wounded a deer and believed it had run across 
the Applicant lot from East to West. They were looking for a "blood line" from the wounded deer.  The pair immediately left the Applicant's lot and went into the winter 
wheat field West of the Applicant's land-- land belonging to another neighbor.  The Applicant's girlfriend called the neighbor who owned the land to tell him there were 
hunters on his land and ask his permission to call the police.  The neighbor did not answer the telephone. When the pair crossed the Applicant's land, they were within 
240 feet of his house.  State law prohibits hunting within 500 feet of a residence or livestock. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant drove his vehicle to the end of his property and then back to within 60 feet of where the hunters were.  He parked, rolled down the window, and tried to 
get eye contact with the hunters. The hunters did not acknowledge his presence.  The Applicant drove back to his house and  retrieved his shotgun.  He went into his back 
yard, and put one shell into the gun, and fired a round toward the end of his property to get the attention of the hunters.  The gun was not aimed at the hunters, nor did he 
threaten the hunters with the gun.  When he fired the gun, the hunters were between 240 and 300 feet from him. (tr 32)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Approximately 10 minutes later the hunters again crossed the Applicant's lot returning to where their car was parked.  The hunters had called the sheriff, who came and 
arrested the Applicant for reckless endangerment which, under the state criminal code, occurs when a person recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial 
risk of serious physical injury to another person.  The Applicant was found guilty of reckless endangerment, fined $290.00, sentenced to three years probation, a one-year 
Order of Protection was granted in favor of his neighbors, and he was ordered to have a friend or relative take possession of his two shotguns. In February 2001, the 
Applicant was discharged from probation. (tr 49)  The Applicant's initial conviction has been overturned on appeal and was set for retrial the week following the security 
clearance hearing. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On the Monday morning following the incident, the Applicant reported the matter to his facility security officer. (tr 25)  The Applicant acknowledges he made an poor 
choice. (tr 32)  Following the incident, the Applicant took an adult aggression management training which consisted of a psychiatric evaluation and two anger management 
classes totaling six hours.  The Applicant regrets his actions, feels remorse, had good insight into the incident, is aware of the consequences of his actions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case 
basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense determinations, 
Administrative Judges must consider, access, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the relevant Adjudicative 
Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not only has the burden of proving any 
controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, but must also demonstrate the facts proven have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in 
reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">CRIMINAL CONDUCT (Guideline J)  The Concern:  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. 
E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">1.  Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged. (E2.A10.1.2.1.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">   2.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. (E2.A10.1.2.2.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">2.  The crime was an isolated incident. (E2.A10.1.3.2.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets that burden, the burden of 
persuasion then shifts to the Applicant who must remove that doubt and establish his security suitability with substantial evidence in explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or 
refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he is 
nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands the Court's rationale, doubts are 
to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline J, (Criminal Conduct).  Under Guideline J, the security eligibility of an applicant is placed into 
question when that applicant is shown to have a history or pattern of criminal activity creating doubt about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  In November 
1999, the Applicant was charged with a single misdemeanor of a serious nature--reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Mitigating Condition (MC) # 1<A HREF="01-03551.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN> does not apply.  Even though the arrest occurred 18 months ago--November 1999-- it is still considered recent.  But MC # 2<A HREF="01-03551.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN> does 
apply.  The Applicant has been arrested only one time.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although his conduct leading to the arrest was a serious event, reckless endangerment, it is only a misdemeanor 
under state law.  At his first trial the Applicant was fined less than $300.00 and sentenced to no jail time.  His conviction was overturned, the Applicant has appealed and 
faces a new trial the week following the hearing.  To the Applicant's credit, he </SPAN>reported the incident to his facility security officer (tr 25) immediately upon his return to 
work.  He has taken efforts to preclude a recurrence of his inappropriate conduct.  He has had a psychiatric evaluation and undergone six hours of anger management.  
The Applicant acknowledged he made a poor choice of actions. (tr 32)  He regrets the incident, feels remorse, has good insight into his conduct, and is aware of the 
consequences for his actions. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I had ample opportunity to evaluate the demeanor of Applicant, observe his manner and deportment, appraise the way in which he 
responded to questions, assess his candor or evasiveness, read his statements, listen to his testimony, and watch the interplay between himself and those around him.  It is 
my impression that Applicant's expressions of regret have the ring of truth. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant </SPAN>is a hard working professional, friendly, courteous, highly motivated, and an important asset who has been recognized for his outstanding work. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The 
incident appears to be an aberration in the Applicant's lifestyle.  An isolated incident which has not been repeated.  Although recent, he has demonstrated good judgment 
in taking anger management classes which evidences rehabilitation.  I am confident such conduct will not recur.  Thus, I conclude that Applicant has, through evidence of 
extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the Government's<EM> prima facie</EM> case.  I find for the Applicant as to SOR subparagraph 1.a.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or conduct will continue 
or recur in the future. </P>
