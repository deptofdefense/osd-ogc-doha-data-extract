<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On October 27, 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-29279.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline C (Foreign 
Preference), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on November 14, 2003 and elected to have a hearing 
before an administrative judge.  Applicant subsequently amplified his answers through counsel in an undated response.  The case was assigned to me on March 
22, 2004.  On April 15, 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, the Government presented three exhibits, which were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, and Exhibit 1 for administrative notice, 
without objection.  Applicant presented ten exhibits, which were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through J, without objection.  DOHA received the 
transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on April 23, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 54-year-old principal engineer for a defense contractor.  He was born and raised in the Peoples Republic of China (China).  In 1982, he was 
awarded a bachelor of science degree majoring in computer science in China.  He married his wife in China in 1978 and they have an 18-year-old son, who was 
born in China in 1986.  GE 1.  In 1986, Applicant immigrated to the United States. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant cited two main reasons he left China.  The first was the negative impact the Cultural Revolution had on his family when he was a teenager.  The 
Chinese government confiscated all of his family's assets, money, and relocated his family to a top floor of their family home.  His father, who was a teacher, 
was persecuted, humiliated, and required to perform menial tasks.  The second occurred in 1984 after Applicant and two of his colleagues founded a computer 
engineering company and the Chinese government confiscated their company assets. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife's parents were intellectuals and were likewise persecuted by the Chinese government during the Cultural Revolution.  Her parents owned a 
large house and her family was forced to live in one bedroom to make room for four-to-five other families to live in the rest of their house.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following the confiscation of his company assets, Applicant applied to attend college in the United States in order to pursue a master of arts degree in computer 
science and technology.  He was accepted, granted a student visa, and successfully completed his degree.  In 1988, his wife and son joined him in the United 
States.  Since 1987, Applicant has enjoyed a successful professional career as valued employee at approximately seven firms since completing his masters 
degree.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant possessed a Chinese passport issued on December 28, 1999.  He testified it was his understanding he was required to have a Chinese passport at the 
time he appeared for his examination for his naturalization application.  Tr. 62-63, , GE 2, AE J.  Applicant's Chinese passport at some point prior to this 
hearing was "cancelled."  AE I.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a brother, sister, father-in-law, and mother-in-law, who are citizens and residents in China.<A HREF="02-29279.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  His brother is chief executive officer for a financial 
institution and his sister is medical director of nursing at a hospital.  The government sent Applicant's sister to work on a distant farm when she was 13 years 
old from 1970 to 1986.  Applicant was unable to see his sister until after he moved to the United States because, after the government confiscated all his 
family's money, they could not afford the train ticket to visit her or for his sister to visit them.  Applicant maintains minimal telephone contact with his siblings 
averaging once a year.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife testified the Chinese government does not treat her parents, who are in their 80s, "the same like the other people" and treats her parents 
"different" than other people.  Tr. 23, 24.  Her mother is a housewife and her father is a retired construction developer.  Tr. 19. Her father receives a small 
government pension.  Tr. 22, 24, 26. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant visited China in April 1995 and June 2000.<A HREF="02-29279.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The primary purpose for Applicant's visits to China was to visit his ailing mother, who was diagnosed 
with heart disease and later on with cancer. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant became a naturalized United States citizen on April 17, 2000, his wife became a naturalized United States citizen on September 15, 2000, and his son 
became a naturalized United States citizen on January 22, 2002.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant owns a home in the United States, is registered to vote, and maintains bank accounts in the United States.  Applicant expressed great affection and 
loyalty for the United States.  He has a demonstrated history of being a trusted and valued employee.  AE E, F, G and H.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline C-Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant exercised foreign preference by possessing a Chinese passport in 1999 (&para; 1.a).  When an Applicant acts in such a way to 
indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the 
interests of the United States.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that he exercised foreign preference by possessing a Chinese passport.  DC 
E2.A3.1.2.1; DC E2.A3.1.2.2.  But a security clearance must "be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official 
approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government."  Memorandum from Arthur L. Money, Assistant Secretary of Defense, 
Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence, to Directors of Defense Agencies, <EM>Guidance to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying 
the Application of the Foreign Preference Adjudicative Guideline </EM>(Aug. 16, 2000).  Applicant took the appropriate steps and has cancelled his</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Chinese passport.  MC E2.A3.1.3.4.  Applicant has mitigated the foreign preference security concerns.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B-Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's brother, sister, mother-in-law, and father-in-law are citizen residents of China; (&para; 2.a)<A HREF="02-29279.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>; that Applicant maintains regular

immediate family, or other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to 
duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations in the SOR-Applicant has immediate family members 
who are citizen residents of a foreign country.  DC E2.A2.1.2.1.  While the</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mere possession of family ties with persons in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law,</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">automatically disqualifying . . . [it] does raise a prima facie security concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or 
mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 at **33-34 (App. Bd. Feb 8, 2001).  It is a mitigating condition if the immediate family members or associates 
are not agents of a foreign power  and are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty 
to his family members and loyalty to the United States.  MC E2.A2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not an exact science.  Instead, they are predictive judgments about an Applicant's security suitability in light of that person's 
past conduct and <EM>present circumstances.  Egan, </EM>484 U.S. at 528-29.  The evidence established that Applicant is a loyal United States citizen.  At the same time, 
the evidence established Applicant has strong ties of affection or obligation to his family members who citizen residents of China.  Although these foreign 
associates are not agents of a foreign power, Applicant failed to demonstrate that his foreign associates are not <EM>in a position of vulnerability </EM>such that he could
