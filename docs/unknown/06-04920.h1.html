<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Twenty-seven-year-old Applicant had fifteen alleged delinquent debts listed on her statement of reasons (SOR), totaling $52,387.  One debt was a duplication, and she disputed six debts.  Others 
were less in magnitude than alleged.  Twelve debts were not legally collectable because of the 3-year South Carolina statute of limitations.  The SOR debts became delinquent between 1999 and 
2004 primarily because of her husband's periodic unemployment. </SPAN> She did not establish sufficient efforts to resolve her delinquent debts. Her false answers on two questions on her Security 
Clearance Application concerning delinquent debts were not deliberate.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">She  mitigated concerns about personal conduct, but not financial considerations.  Clearance is denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On December 2, 2004, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security Clearance Application <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SF 86).<A HREF="06-04920.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN> On March 30, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, 
and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.<A HREF="06-04920.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges 
security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct).  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In an answer, notarized on May 9, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided at a hearing.<A HREF="06-04920.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  On October 31, 2006, the case was assigned to me.  The 
hearing was held on November 27, 2006.  DOHA received the hearing record (R.) on December 12, 2006, and I received it on December 13, 2006.  Based on Applicant's request at the hearing ( R. 
88-89), I agreed to hold the record open until January 1, 2007 to permit her to provide additional documentary evidence.  On January 22, 2006, Department Counsel informed me that no additional 
documentary evidence was received (Exhibits (Ex.) G, H).    </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations under Guidelines F and E, Applicant admitted that she was responsible for the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a, 1.h, and 1.i.  She said the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.c, 1.e, and 1.j,  were her 
husband's responsibility, and the debt in SOR &para; 1.d was a duplication of the debt in SOR &para; 1.c.  She did not recognize the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.k, 1.m, and 1.n, and she disputed the debt in SOR &para; 1.l 
asserting it was Medicare's responsibility.  She did not address the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.b, 1.f, and 1.g. In regard to the allegations that her answers to Questions 38 and 39 of her SF 86 were 
deliberately false, she said she did not  deliberately provide false information.  She misunderstood the requirement.  Moreover, she provided information about her most significant delinquent debts.  
Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional 
findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 27 years old (R. 5).<A HREF="06-04920.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  She is a high school graduate (R. 5).  She was married on June 6, 1998 (R. 39).  Her three children are ages 2, 4 and 6 (R. 39).<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="06-04920.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> </SPAN>  She has no prior military 
service.<A HREF="06-04920.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  She needs a clearance so she can enter restricted areas for cable fabrication (R. 32).  </P>

</P> 
<P>The debt in SOR &para; 1.b involved the repossession of Applicant's truck in 2000.  She was unable to make one of the monthly payments (R. 42).  Her next payment was a double payment, but it was 
$25 short (R. 42-43).  The finance company agreed to accept the payment anyway, and authorized her to pay $25 extra the following month (R. 42-43).  Then the finance company repossessed the 
truck because the payment was $25 short without advance notification to Applicant (R. 42).  The finance company refused to return the truck unless Applicant paid the loan in full (R. 43).  </P> 
 
<P>The debt in SOR &para; 1.g involved the repossession of Applicant's car in 2001.  Applicant fell behind in her payments by two months, and her husband was unemployed ( R. 63).  Applicant called the 
creditor and told the creditor to repossess her car (R. 63). </P> 
 
<P>In September 2006, Applicant paid a credit improvement company (CIC) $300 to help her with her creditors and to improve her credit (R. 48).  CIC sent the SOR creditors a letter asking for the 
status of Applicant's debt, and requested an amount to settle the creditor's account (R. 56-58).  If the creditor failed to respond to CIC's inquiry, the CIC indicated that the result of their 
investigation is the debt is "DELETED" (Ex. A at 1).  In the 60 days preceding Applicant's hearing, only one creditor responded to CIC's letters.  The creditor in SOR &para; 1.o offered to settle their 
debt for $81 (R. 60, 70-71, 87).  CIC did discuss as part of their contract, the process for resolving or settling debts, and how to improve one's credit ratings (Ex. A).  CIC did not provide and 
Applicant has not received any debt counseling (R. 87, 94).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant believed that the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.k, 1.l, and 1.m were the responsibility of Medicare and disputed them (R. 67-70).  According to CIC's report, SOR &para;&para; 1.k, and 1.l remained on her 
credit report as delinquent accounts, and SOR &para; 1.m was "DELETED" after their investigation (Ex. A at 1, 4). </P> 
 
<P>She attributed her financial problems to her husband's periodic unemployment (R. 39).  He would quit his jobs, and they would not receive income from unemployment (R. 40).  In order to care for 
her young children, she left employment with the government contractor, and was not employed outside her home from September 22, 2000, until November 29, 2004 (R. 40). <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the time she 
returned to work in 2004, her husband had been unemployed for five months (R. 44).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A witness (W), who supervises Applicant, and has known her as a friend for ten years, described her as truthful, dependable, hard-working, and knowledgeable concerning her employment (R. 23-24).  W attributed her financial problems to her husband's unemployment and failure to provide financial support to her (R. 27).  W's supervisor (S), who has known Applicant for more than two 
years, said Applicant is one of his best employees (R. 29-31).  She is paid $12 per hour (R. 36).  She is trustworthy, truthful and an outstanding employee (R. 34). In October 2006, she received the 
Employee of the Month award for an office of 350 employees (R. 31; Ex. B and D).  S reasoned that her husband's sporadic unemployment because of his work in a seasonal type of repair business 
was the cause of Applicant's financial problems (R. 31).  His company hired Applicant's husband in October 2005, and now both of them should be receiving steady, consistent incomes, which he 
predicted would help establish financial responsibility (R. 31, 74).  Prior to her hearing, S told Applicant that it was important for her to get credit reports and determine what she could do to correct 
her financial problems (R. 33).  He did not discuss financial counseling with her (R. 33-34).  Other witnesses described Applicant as intelligent, diligent, professionally competent, helpful, and a 
person of high integrity with a positive attitude towards her job and family (Exs. B-E). </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and her husband's gross salary was $4,883 per month, her net salary is $3,558 per month (R. 76-77).  She listed monthly household expenses as follows:  rent ($750), groceries ($700), 
clothing ($50), utilities ($300), telephone services ($100), car expenses ($803), daycare ($600), and miscellaneous ($00) (R. 78-82).  After expressing some confusion about her expenses, she 
concluded that her family had sufficient income to pay all of her family's expenses, but there was no money remaining to pay her delinquent debts (R. 82). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant said on November 27, 2006, she could show progress on her recent debts if the record was held open until January 1, 2007 (R. 88, 99).   Applicant did not provide any documents after the 
hearing terminated documenting such progress (Ex. H).       </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Question 38 of Applicant's security clearance application asks, "[i]n the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?" and Question 39, asks "[a]re you currently over 90 
days delinquent on any debt(s)?"  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When she completed her security clearance application on December 2, 2004, she answered, "Yes" to question 38 and disclosed the debts in SOR </SPAN>&para;&para; 1.b ($5,085); 
1.f ($30,856); and 1.g ($9,313).<A HREF="06-04920.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  These three SOR debts total $45,254.  Applicant answered, "No" to question 39.  For question 38, she explained she had forgotten about the other debts that were 
over 180 days delinquent (R. 72).  For question 39, she said she thought the information sought was debts delinquent between 90 and 180 days, and no debts fell within that range (R. 72-73).  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After 
considering all the record evidence, I find that she was sincere and truthful about her intent, and her answers on questions 38 and 39 of her SF 86 were honest mistakes, rather than deliberate lies.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In an evaluation of an applicant's security suitability, an administrative judge must consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant's eligibility 
for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive &para; E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="06-04920.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,  in 
accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.  Directive &para; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E3.1.15 provides, "The applicant is responsible 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of 
persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 
2005).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="06-04920.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty 
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect 
or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>The scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically 
provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance 
decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P>

Guideline F (Financial Considerations), "[a]n individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds."  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who fails 
or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  FC DC 1 applies where an applicant has a history of not 
meeting his or her financial obligations.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.1.  FC DC 3 applies where an applicant has exhibited inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's 
actions in initially failing to satisfy her outstanding financial obligations give rise to FC DC 1 and 3.  In her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted she was responsible for several of the fifteen 
debts listed on the SOR.  She recognized that her debts became delinquent because her family spent too much money, and had too little income. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> The government produced substantial evidence of 
these two disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
government.<SUP><A HREF="06-04920.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated by substantial evidence under FC MCs 1 or 2 that "the behavior was not recent" or "it was an isolated incident."  Directive &para;&para; 
E2.A6.1.3.1 and E2.A6.1.3.2.  </SPAN>The Directive does not define "recent," and there is no "bright-line" definition of what constitutes "recent" conduct.  Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as 
a whole,<A HREF="06-04920.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> I conclude FC MCs 1 and 2 do not apply because Applicant had multiple delinquent SOR debts at the time of her hearing, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and she is not making payments on any SOR debts. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant disclosed some information to support consideration of FC MC 3, "the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a 
business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)."  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.3.  She indicated she was unemployed from September 22, 2000, until November 29, 
2004, and her husband has been unemployed periodically during that same period.  However, her financial difficulties remain largely unexplained.  Although unemployment caused her financial 
problems, she has not provided enough information about changes in her financial situation, with linkage to the resolution of her delinquent debts after she and her husband were both employed by 
the contractor to warrant full application of FC MC 3.  From the date the SOR was issued (March 30, 2006), to the date the record was closed (January 1, 2007), Applicant has been on notice of the 
SOR debts.  Nevertheless, she has not paid any of her SOR creditors anything, or even promised to pay any of them anything.<A HREF="06-04920.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">FC MCs 4 and 6 can mitigate a security concern arising from financial problems when</SPAN>, "the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    </SPAN>Based on the sincerity of her testimony, and some indicia of improved financial self-discipline, I have some confidence that she is on the right track towards correction of her financial problems.  
She receives partial credit under FC MC 4 because there is sufficient evidence that she has begun to receive financial or credit counseling.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="06-04920.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN>  However, there is insufficient evidence that her

<P>FC MC 6 does not apply because there is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of her debts.<A HREF="06-04920.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN>  She does, however, receive some credit in the whole 
person analysis, <EM>infra</EM>, for the application of the 3-year South Carolina statute of limitations, which applies to all of her SOR debts, except the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.m, 1.n, and 1.o.  <EM>See</EM> S.C. Code. 
Ann. &sect; 15-3-530.  The South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application of the statute of limitations:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Statutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they</SPAN> stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and stability to human affairs.  The 
cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.  Significantly, statutes of limitations provide potential 
defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred claims.  Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their 
rights.  Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.</P> 
 
<P>  </P>

<P>The reduction in the magnitude and number of her debts that creditors can legally enforce because of the application of the statute of limitations has also reduced her potential vulnerability to 
improper financial inducements. The degree that she is "financially overextended," is also greatly reduced.  However, it does not negate her past conduct which failed to take timely actions to 
resolve her financial jeopardy.  Moreover, she has not provided sufficient information about how she attempted to resolve or repay her SOR debts, beyond working with CIC to improve her credit.  
In sum, she has not demonstrated sufficient effort to resolve financial concerns because over the last 12 months she has not paid or settled any of her delinquent SOR debts.</P>

<P>Under Guideline E, "conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that 
[applicant] may not properly safeguard classified information."  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two personal conduct disqualifying conditions (PC DC) could potentially raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  PC DC 2 applies where there has been </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"deliberate 
omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine 
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.2. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A security concern 
may result under PC DC 3 when an applicant deliberately provides "false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical 
authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.3. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For PC DCs 2 and 3, Applicant gave an incorrect or incomplete answer to questions 38 and 39 of her 2004 SF 86.  The evidence of record, however, does not establish deliberate falsification.  
Although she admitted preparing her SF 86, and answering incorrectly, she did not fully understood the question, or the information the government sought.<A HREF="06-04920.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on Guideline E may be mitigated by substantial evidence of personal conduct mitigating conditions (PC MC). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Under PC MC 1, security concerns may be mitigated when 
the derogatory "information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability."  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The allegations in SOR &para;&para; 2.a and 2.b are

As 
noted above, Applicant's failure to make progress resolving her SOR debts is a serious, ongoing, long-term problem and is sufficiently serious to be a security concern. E2.2.1.1. Her actions were 
knowledgeable and voluntary.  E2.2.1.2 and E2.2.1.5.<SUP></SUP>  Some of her SOR debts are currently unpaid and unresolved.  E2.2.1.3.  She is 27 years old, sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her 
conduct.  E2.2.1.4.<SUP></SUP> The motivation for her failure to pay her debts was caused by low income as well as poor financial choices.  E2.2.1.7. A person "who is financially overextended is at risk of 
having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds" and as such there is the potential for pressure and exploitation.  E2.A6.1.1 and E2.2.1.7.  The likelihood of recurrence cannot yet be determined 
because insufficient evidence was presented about improvement in her financial situation, and  corroborating evidence of change is sparse.  E2.2.1.6 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">E2.2.1.9. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The absence of evidence of any 
prior security violation, her forthright and candid statement at her hearing, and her evident sincerity about making financial progress all weigh in her favor.  However, there is a paucity of supporting
