<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 38-year-old male, working as an antenna design engineer for a federal defense contractor since 1997. He was arrested twice. The first charge, for 
aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in April 2000, was dismissed. His October 2001 arrest for driving while intoxicated resulted in a conviction and 
included supervised probation, community service, and payment of a fine. He has been alcohol free since 2001. Applicant has over 10 delinquent debts totaling 
approximately $22,788. He offered no evidence in support of his contention that some of these debts were consolidated and being paid off. He has not mitigated 
the criminal conduct or financial considerations security concerns. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant under Executive Order 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (the Directive). On January 10, 2005, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision: criminal conduct under Guideline J and financial considerations under Guideline F. Applicant 
answered the SOR on March 28, 2005 and requested a decision without a hearing.</P> 
<P>Department counsel submitted the government's written case on July 15, 2005.  Department Counsel provided a complete copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM) to Applicant, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the allegations. Applicant 
received the FORM on May 3, 2005. He did not respond to the FORM by the due date. On July 15, 2005, Department counsel submitted Applicant's response 
to the FORM. The government did not object to this document being submitted out of time. The case was assigned to me on June 15, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant admits all the allegations stated in the SOR, with the exception of the allegations in &para; 2.a, a debt he believes may not be his responsibility; he believes 
it belongs to his wife, from whom he is separated.<A HREF="03-22679.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Those admissions are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the record evidence as a 
whole, I find it sufficient to establish the conduct alleged in the SOR. I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 38-year-old male, working as an antenna design engineer for a federal defense contractor since 1997.<A HREF="03-22679.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He was married in 1991 and is now 
separated from his wife.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">From 1985 to 1988 he served in the U.S. Army as a Corporal (E-4). From 1988 to 1993, he was in the U.S. Army Reserve as a sergeant (E-5).<A HREF="03-22679.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> He has held a 
security clearance since 1988, until the initiation of this instant action.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">He attended a Junior College from 1989until he graduated in June 1993. From 1993 to 1995 he attended a university and graduated in August 1995 with a BEE 
degree.<A HREF="03-22679.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was arrested on April 9, 2000 and charged with Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon, a felony. In a letter dated March 3, 2005, his attorney in 
this incident, stated "the charge was never prosecuted because of lack of supporting evidence against [Applicant] and the statute of limitation has expired."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In October 2001, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI). He pled </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>nolo</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>contender</EM>e and was sentenced to 180 days in jail, suspended, two years' 
supervised probation, 100 hours of community service, and ordered to attend a victim's impact panel and to pay fines and court costs of $953. The two-year 
probation began in July 2004. He attended DWI training and a victim's impact panel session. He has completed about 70 hours of the 100 hours of community 
service. He has paid all the fines and fees. Since this incident in 2002, he has not consumed alcoholic beverages.<A HREF="03-22679.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant allegedly owes a total of approximately $22,788 for 10 different debts incurred by him over the course of several years. He admits all of these debts, 
except one for $6,183, and he is uncertain as to whether this debt is, in fact, his responsibility. He thinks this might belong to his wife from whom he is 
separated.<A HREF="03-22679.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant disputes a $79 cable bill because he contends he did not authorize the service.<A HREF="03-22679.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> He is seeking a deferment on a debt for tuition to a university he 
attended for $1,964. There are two bank debts outstanding; one is $1,194 and the other is $5,892.<A HREF="03-22679.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> He contends he made several attempts to resolve these two 
accounts through a payment program, which was not accepted. There are a number of other debts that he says were consolidated with his bank back in 
September-October 2004 and allegedly have been paid off. These debts are: bank debts for $1,992, $1,713, $2,384, and $596. Moreover, he indicated that 
another debt for $791 has also been consolidated with his bank. He offered no evidence corroboration that such a consolidation does in fact exist.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, and the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding 
circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation, and (6) the 
probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.<A HREF="03-22679.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or 
against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-22679.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-22679.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is less than a preponderance of the 
evidence.<A HREF="03-22679.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to 
overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-22679.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-22679.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-22679.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-22679.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="03-22679.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="03-22679.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon consideration of all the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline J - Criminal Conduct: a security concern exists when a person has a history or pattern of criminal activity which creates doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations:  a security concern exists when a person has significant delinquent debts.  An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable 
criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns pertaining to the adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based on all the evidence as a whole, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>allegations or admission of criminal conduct, 
regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>) and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>), both apply in this case. 
Applicant has committed two serious offenses. Based on E2.A10.1.2,1 I find that he was convicted of two offenses, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon 
and DWI. The mere fact that the aggravated assault charge was dismissed, does not mean that he did not commit a heinous crime. Moreover, he admitted 
committing both offenses. I conclude that E2.A10.1.2.1 applies. Similarly, one allegation was a felony, while the other was a DWI. A felony is a serious crime 
as is a DWI. Thus, I conclude that CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 also applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I considered all the Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) and specifically considered FC MC E2.A10.1.3.1 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the criminal behavior was not recent</EM>), 
CC MC E2.A10.1.3.4 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in that's person's life</EM>), and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> CC 
C E2.A10.1.3.6</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> (there is a clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>). The aggravated assault charge occurred in 2000 and was dismissed because of lack of 
prosecution and supporting evidence; that fact that it was dismissed cannot be used in mitigation under the Directive. Thus, I find that this incident was not 
recent and since 2000 there is no evidence in the record of any other assault charges. Similarly, the DWI charge occurred in 2001, almost four years ago. Not 
only is he on supervised probation, he has been sober-free since that incident in 2001. I conclude that FC MC E2.A10.1.3.1 applies here. Since there have not 
been any other assault charges and since Applicant has been sober-free for more than four years, I conclude that FC MC E2.A10.1.3.4 and FC MC E2.A10.1.3.6 
apply here.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The security concern arising from financial difficulties is that "an</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to 
generate funds." The Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC 
DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 arises where there is a "</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>history of not meeting financial obligations.</EM>" Similarly, FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 applies where the information shows an 
"</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>," Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations. He was delinquent on several debts, which 
continues to date. He did not provide credible proof that some of his bills were consolidated and being paid off. I conclude FC DC E2.A6.1.2.1 and FC DC 
E2.A6.1.2.3 apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Various conditions can mitigate the security concerns arising from financial difficulties. I conclude that none of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F, 
financial considerations, apply in this case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I considered all the evidence in this case and also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our 
national interests. Applicant is a mature individual who encountered financial difficulties, including the inability to timely pay his delinquent debts. His debts 
are still outstanding and there has been no movement to show that he is in charge of his derogatory financial situation. I am persuaded by the totality of the 
evidence in this case that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns caused by his criminal conduct. Accordingly, Guideline J, pertaining to criminal 
conduct, is decided for Applicant. However, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns caused by his financial difficulties. Accordingly, Guideline F, 
pertaining to financial considerations, is decided against Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Formal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</SPAN></P>
