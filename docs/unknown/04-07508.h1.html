<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant deliberately falsified his December 2001 clearance application by omitting his May 1999 arrest for felony stalking, child abuse, and indecent 
exposure, and his subsequent court-ordered sex offender treatment.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Clearance denied.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 5 May 2005 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of his 
clearance because of personal conduct<A HREF="04-07508.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. He answered the SOR 27 June 2005, and requested a decision without hearing. He did not respond to DOHA's 30 
September 2005 File of Relevant Material (FORM). The record closed 11 December 2005, when his response was due. DOHA assigned the case to me 19 
December 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR, but denied intent to falsify his clearance application when he failed to disclose a 1974 burglary arrest, a 1977 
burglary arrest, and a 1983 DUI arrest. I incorporate his admissions as findings of fact. He is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a 49-year-old installation technician employed by defense 
contractors since approximately April 1990. He appears to have held a clearance since 1991; his most recent clearance date is November 1997.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant completed his December 2001 clearance application to begin his periodic reinvestigation, he deliberately failed to disclose his May 1999 arrest 
for felony stalking, child abuse, and indecent exposure (question 21) and his ongoing court-ordered sex offender treatment (question 19). In his January 2004 
sworn statement, he admitted omitting this information because "I was embarrassed and worried about my security clearance and worried about who in my 
office might see my EPSQ and pre-judge me badly."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also failed to disclose a 1974 felony arrest for burglary and a 1977 felony arrest for burglary (question 21) and a 1983 DUI arrest (question 
24)--although he did disclose a 1987 DUI arrest. Applicant denies deliberately omitting these arrests, asserting that he filled the clearance application by 
memory and did not check his records. When Applicant applied for a clearance in 1990, he apparently forgot these arrests as well. However, he discussed the 
two burglary arrests in an April 1991 sworn statement, and vaguely recalled the 1983 DUI arrest in a May 1991 sworn statement while he was discussing his 
1987 DUI. These three arrests were apparently adjudicated favorably in 1991 and 1997.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's employer appears to have learned of his sex offender status in August 2002, and the employer duly notified the Government. Applicant first 
discussed the details of his May 1999 arrest and subsequent treatment with Government agents in January 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline E (Personal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="04-07508.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a Guideline E case and Applicant did not mitigate the conduct. He deliberately concealed his May 1999 arrest and sex offender 
treatment from the Government.<A HREF="04-07508.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He did so because he feared he would not keep his job or his clearance if he was truthful.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> His employer did not learn of his sex 
offender status until August 2002 (at which time it notified the Government) and he did not disclose his May 1999 arrest and subsequent sex-offender treatment 
until his January 2004 subject interview. And no evidence suggests he voluntarily disclosed the information before questioning or confrontation.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="04-07508.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's conduct demonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared personnel. The government has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse 
information about an Applicant before making a clearance decision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information. 
Further, an applicant's willingness to report adverse information about himself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security 
violations or other security concerns in the future, something the government relies on in order to perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of 
classified information. Applicant's conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government interests. I resolve Guideline E 
against Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for Applicant. Clearance denied.</SPAN></P>

keep this information from the Government (having forgotten the arrests) and because the arrests were no longer relevant and material to a clearance determination, having been previously 
adjudicated twice.
