</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 23 August 2004 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of 
his clearance because of personal conduct.<A HREF="03-06167.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant answered the SOR on 30 August 2004 and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 19 
November 2004 and I convened a hearing on 12 January 2005. DOHA received the transcript on 21 January 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the Guideline E allegations; accordingly, I incorporate his admissions as findings of fact. He is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a 41-year-old computer technician employed 
by a defense contractor since March 2002, seeking reinstatement of the clearance he held in the Army until approximately May 1998.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In August 1997, Applicant deliberately cut the automobile brake lines of his 8-months-pregnant paramour.<A HREF="03-06167.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant was quickly charged with adultery, 
destruction of private property (by cutting the brake lines), and aggravated assault (GE 3) and tried by general court-martial. Pursuant to a pre-trial agreement, 
Applicant pleaded to adultery and destruction of private property; the aggravated assault charge was dismissed. Applicant's pleas were provident, and he was 
found guilty by judge alone. Applicant elected to be sentenced by members (the military equivalent of a jury), but procedural irregularities ultimately caused 
Applicant to receive no sentence for his crimes. However, he did receive an other-than-honorable discharge in lieu of court-martial (GE 7).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant cut his paramour's brake lines because he wanted her to leave him alone. He claims he only wanted to scare her, not hurt her. However, he 
acknowledged that he was concerned about his Army career and his security clearance if the Army found out about his adultery. At hearing, Applicant 
acknowledged his past poor judgment and pleaded the passage of time since his crime. He did not otherwise present evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or 
rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classif</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ied information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-06167.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>

Applicant's misconduct was egregious and demonstrates extraordinarily poor judgement and unreliability inconsistent with access to classified information. 
Only a technical error by the government kept Applicant from leaving the Army with a court-awarded bad conduct discharge. Applicant pleads the passage of

resisting.  The paramour's efforts to contact Applicant, lead to his wife's discovery of both the affair and the pregnancy. Ironically, the wife was also pregnant at the time.
