<P>Administrative Judge Joseph Testan issued a decision dated September 29, 2000 in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the reasons set forth 
below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P>The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the issues of whether the Administrative Judge erred by basing his entire opinion on an erroneous 
finding that Applicant intentionally falsified his financial history on his security clearance application, and whether the 
Administrative Judge's adverse decision is not warranted because Applicant is not a security risk.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of  Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant on May 19, 2000.  The SOR was 
predicated on Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  
Applicant requested a hearing which was held on August 29, 2000.  The Administrative Judge issued an unfavorable decision 
dated September 29, 2000.  Applicant appealed.<A HREF="00-0222.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant asserts that the Administrative Judge made an erroneous finding that Applicant intentionally falsified his financial 
history on his security clearance application and then based his entire adverse decision on that finding.  Applicant's argument is 
unpersuasive.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge's finding of falsification is supported by enough record evidence to meet the standard cited in the 
Directive for the Board to affirm. (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1: "The Administrative Judge's 
findings of fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in 
light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.")  Here, Applicant presented a different explanation at the hearing than he had 
in his July 20, 1999 signed statement for his failure to list all of his financial delinquencies.  He asserted at the hearing and on 
appeal that his signed statement was not prepared by him and that signing it was a mistake.  However, he had initialed or corrected 
several paragraphs including paragraphs on the same page as the controverted declaration.  The explanation offered (for the 
omission of the delinquencies in the security clearance application form) in Applicant's signed statement was a virtual admission 
of intentional falsification.  The Administrative Judge's finding of intentional falsification is supported by sufficient evidence to be 
affirmed.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's argument that the Administrative Judge's finding of falsification was the basis for the entire decision is not supported 
by the plain language of the Administrative Judge's decision.  A reading of the decision below leaves no reasonable basis to doubt 
that the Administrative Judge decided the case based on his adverse conclusions under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) in 
addition to his adverse conclusions about Applicant's falsification.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's assertion that he is not a security risk fails to demonstrate the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, 
or contrary to law.  The federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access 
to classified information.  Applicant's history of unresolved financial problems and his falsification of the security questionnaire 
provide a rational basis for the Judge's adverse decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating error below.  Accordingly, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's 
September 29, 2000 decision.</P>
