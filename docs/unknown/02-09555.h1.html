<P>Applicant has had a long history of alcohol abuse.  The first time he received alcohol abuse counseling in 1995,  he was not ultimately successful, because he 
again began consuming alcohol. His second treatment has been more successful, because Applicant is more committed to sobriety, including attending meetings 
six to seven times a week at Alcoholics Anonymous, and he has abstained from alcohol consumption since <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">December 16, 2002. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Evidence of Applicant's 
alcohol rehabilitation is sufficient to mitigate his alcohol related history. Clearance is granted.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On August 11, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">signed and sworn, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">notarized response, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">November 22, 2003</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, to the allegations set forth in the SOR. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He requested a clearance decision 
based on a hearing record b</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">efore a DOHA Administrative Judge.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 4, 2004, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to 
the parties on March 3, 2004, and the hearing was held on April 27, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered five documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 5) and no witnesses were called. Applicant, through his counsel, offered 10 
documentary exhibits (Exhibits A - J) and his own testimony. The transcript (TR) was received on May 12, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In the SOR, the Government alleges that 
a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline G of the Directive because of Applicant's excessive alcohol consumption. The SOR contains four 
allegations, 1.a. through 1.d., under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant admits all of the allegations.  The admitted allegations are incorporated as 
findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">admitted</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 
and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is 46 years old. He is married and has two children. He is employed as a Field Engineer by a defense contractor, and he seeks to retain a DoD security 
clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol consumption). </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses alcohol to excess.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant first consumed alcohol when he was 11 years of age, and excessive drinking began at age 13.  He enlisted in the United States Nave when he was 21. 
In </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">October 1988</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">,  Applicant's consumption of beer was six to twelve beers a day.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">By March 1995, his consumption had escalated to 12 to 18 beers a day, and he referred himself for treatment for his alcohol consumption. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He entered a 
treatment program at an Army medical center. He was diagnosed as having acute alcoholism with liver problems. The treatment consisted of four weeks of in 
house treatment, with individual and group counseling, and one year of aftercare, which involved attending three Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings a 
week.  Applicant abstained from consuming alcohol for  21 months until December 1997, when he again consumed alcohol. Ultimately, his consumption 
escalated again, and while he could drink moderately at times, there were also frequent times when he would drink to the point of intoxication (Tr at 40-45, 
Exhibit 2).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant last consumed alcohol on December 16, 2002.  On January 11, 2003, he was evaluated by a Ph.D., licensed psychologist, who diagnosed Applicant as 
being alcohol dependent without physiological dependence.  He stated about Applicant, "He is motivated for treatment and recovery and has a supportive 
family system. . . . His prognosis: is good if the dictates of his treatment program are adhered to with little deviation." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">From February 20, 2003, through April 1, 2003, Applicant successfully completed treated in an intensive alcohol outpatient treatment program. Applicant 
followed up with six months of aftercare and 10 sessions with his treating psychologist and consistent attendance at AA meetings. His initial goal was to attend  
90 meetings in 90 days, which he did. He currently attends six or seven AA  meetings a week (Tr at 31, 32) (Exhibits C, H, I).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>  </STRONG>Applicant submitted a letter of reference from his supervisor which was extremely positive about Applicant as a  a good and trusted employee (Exhibit B). He 
also submitted his performance evaluation which gave Applicant an Outstanding evaluation (Exhibit A).  Three letters were introduced from fellow members of 
AA, which were extremely  positive about his involvement with that organization (Exhibits D, E, F).  Finally, he presented a letter from his wife which stated 
that Applicant has a more mature outlook and is far more committed to AA than he was previously (Exhibit J).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Finally, I have considered that Applicant served twenty years in the U.S. Navy, and he never received an adverse evaluation or report because of alcohol. He has 
also never been arrested for Driving Under the Influence of alcohol (DUI) or any other alcohol related violation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. 
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider 
the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly<STRONG> </STRONG>consistent<STRONG> </STRONG>with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day. The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's 
part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future." The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this 
order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>

</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that Applicant has used alcohol to excess (Guideline G). Applicant, on 
the other hand, has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against him.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).</STRONG> While Applicant has had a long history of consuming alcohol to excess, he was credible when he 
testified that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">he last consumed alcohol on December 16, 2002.  I have also considered the fact that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's alcohol consumption never resulted in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">a DUI or 
any other alcohol related violation, or adversely affected his current employment or career in the Navy. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">All of Applicant's treatment has been as a result of his own initiative. While his first treatment ultimately resulted in his drinking again after 21 months, the 
evidence has been extremely persuasive that he is more committed to sobriety, and that he has a better overall support team, including  AA,  to help him to 
remain sober. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government established that Applicant has received an diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a credentialed medical professional </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">which is 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Disqualifying Condition (DC) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(E2.A7.1.2.3). It has also been established </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">by substantial evidence that Applicant  has engaged in habitual or binge consumption 
of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment which is which is DC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(E2.A7.1.2.5.). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating Condition (MC) (E2.A7.1.3.3.) applies because of the positive changes in Applicant's behavior supportive of sobriety. Also, MC (E2.A7.1.3.4.) is 
applicable because Applicant has successfully completed an outpatient rehabilitation  program, including aftercare, and has been extremely committed to AA; 
he has abstained from alcohol for greater than twelve months; and he has received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional.  Overall, the 
mitigating conditions outweigh the disqualifying conditions, and Paragraph 1 is concluded for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance. Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding for Applicant as expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's SOR. </SPAN></P>
