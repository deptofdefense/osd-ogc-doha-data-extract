<P>Applicant has a history of delinquent debts (mostly business-related) he incurred between 1994 and 2002.  The debts total over $34,000.00 and still remain 
largely unaddressed. While Applicant is to be encouraged in seeking compromise repayment arrangements in the past year, his repayment efforts remain too 
much a work in progress to make any safe predictable judgments at this time about his debt resolution prospects.  Applicant fails to mitigate security concerns

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">          On July 17, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance, and recommended referral 
to an administrative judge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on August 14, 2003, and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant was furnished the File 
of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 19, 2004, and received it on January 28, 2004.  Applicant  responded to the FORM within the 30 days provided him 
with supplemental documentation regarding his finances.   The case was assigned to me March 12, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated a number of delinquent debts, some resulting in judgments, a federal tax lien and a several 
bankruptcy petitions over an eight year period spanning 1994 and 2002: two debts exceeding $2,900.00, six judgments totaling in excess of $27,000.00, a 
federal tax lien in the approximate amount of $7,213.00, and three bankruptcy petitions that were ultimately dismissed for failure to appear (on a November 
1998 Chapter 7 petition) and failure to make payments (on respective Chapter 13 petitions in September 1996 and October 1994).  For his answer to the SOR, 
Applicant admitted most of the allegations. He denied having a federal tax lien, claiming it was satisfied and released.  Applicant claimed his priority to be 
getting an offer in compromise approved with his tax creditors, and then to try and resolve several of his other creditors.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 36-year-old machinist for a defense contractor  who seeks a security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant 
are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Beginning in 1994, Applicant joined his father as a partner in the former's machine and tool business.  Together, Applicant and his father purchased expensive 
equipment, and Applicant assumed major responsibility for the management of the business's daily operations.  By June 1994,  the business had deteriorated 
considerably, and Applicant's father filed for Chapter 13 protection.  Unable to keep the business financed in the face of his  father's Chapter 13 filing, 
Applicant himself filed for Chapter 13 protection in September 1994.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the ensuing two years following their chapter 13 petitions, Applicant continued to operate their business and met their required Chapter 13 obligations.  
When Applicant and his father could no longer keep up with the company's incurred debt obligations, both of their Chapter petitions were dismissed in May 
1996.  Applicant's father immediately filed for filed for Chapter 7 relief (in May 1996).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant continued to struggle to keep the business operating, even after his father had filed for Chapter 7 relief.    But with debts mounting and the loss of a 
major contract, Applicant shut down all business operations of the family business in December 1997.  A year later (in November 1998), Applicant himself 
filed for Chapter 7 relief, claiming debts of $128,880.00 on scheduled assets of $171,036.45. When he failed to appear for a scheduled bankruptcy hearing in 
February 1999, Applicant's Chapter 7 petition was dismissed. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's delinquent debts with creditors 1.a and 1.b, totaling in excess of $2,900.00, have not been paid, or otherwise resolved, to date.  Six of his creditors 
have reduced their claims to judgment.  Altogether, Applicant's judgment creditors (covered by creditors 1.c through 1.h) hold judgments in excess of $27,000.  
Additionally, the IRS has a recorded $7,213.00 federal tax lien against him.  While Applicant claims to have obtained a release of this lien, he provides no 
documentation of a satisfaction and release. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the first two years of his employment with his most recent defense contractor, Applicant reported a net monthly remainder of $926.00 a month.  Despite 
these available resources, he made no tangible effort during this period to pay on his delinquent debts.  While he claims to have several compromise offers 
pending, he has yet to finalize any that he can document in the record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provides no plan of repayment or resolution of his outstanding debts and remains indebted to his listed creditors on each of the listed debts in the 
SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1.  The behavior was not recent.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (<EM>e.g., </EM>loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 6.  The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding 
that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the 
evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the 
evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the SOR and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have 
a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require 
the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant accrued considerable delinquent debt between 1994 and 1997, most of it business-related.  Unable to satisfy his debts, he filed a series of bankruptcy 
petitions over a five-year period spanning 1994 to 1999.   Each of these bankruptcy petitions were dismissed, and Applicant continues to be responsible for an 
accumulation of delinquent debts and judgments totaling in excess of $30,000.00.  This accumulation of unresolved debt raises continuing security concerns for 
the Government. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Despite his more recent efforts to pay off and compromise his old debts, Applicant remains obligated to all but one of the creditors listed in the SOR. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> On this 
record, two of the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations apply: DC 1 (history of not meeting financial 
obligations) and DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant's accrued debts are accompanied by extenuating circumstances (<EM>viz., </EM>his business-related bankruptcy petitions), for the most part his finances 
have permitted modest attempts to pay on his old creditors with the resources available to him before his recent loss of his interim clearance and related job.  
So, while his debts are extenuated enough to enable him to invoke MC 3 (conditions largely beyond the person's control) of the Guideline, he must demonstrate 
mitigation as well to absolve himself of risks associated with past financial difficulties.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's debts are not sufficiently mitigated to enable him to take advantage of any of the mitigating conditions at this time.  His debt accumulations 
attributable to the family business he and his father endeavored to save have never been satisfactorily addressed since his series of failed bankruptcy attempts.  
His  repayment efforts remain a work in progress and insufficient at this time to invoke any of the mitigating conditions of the Guidelines, primarily MC 6 
(initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors) based on his repayment efforts. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Appeal Board has counseled against according much weight to belated efforts to address delinquent debts well after the security clearance process has been 
initiated.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-33581 (July 20, 2004).  Also, where there is insufficient evidence of repayment efforts (as here) after the conditions that 
contributed to an applicant's delinquent debts have passed, the Appeal Board has cautioned against crediting the applicant with either non-recent financial 
difficulties (MC 1 of the Guidelines) or excuse from addressing his delinquent debts (even those accrued because of extenuating circumstances).  <EM>See </EM>ISCR 
Case No. 03-01059 (September 2004).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's claims of satisfying his federal tax lien and contacting his creditors with compromise offers, he provides no documentation of either his 
payment/compromise efforts or viable repayment plan with his current resources.  His efforts to date are not of sufficient strength to enable him to mitigate 
security concerns associated with his longstanding delinquent debts. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all of the circumstances of Applicant's accumulated debts, the absence of sufficient attention he has shown with his debts in the past, and 
claimed recent efforts in addressing his debts, unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.a through 1.m of the allegations governed by the 
Adjudicative Guidelines pertinent to Guideline F. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E: 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P>
