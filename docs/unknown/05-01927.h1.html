<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant was arrested four times between 1989 and 2000 for relatively minor criminal offenses. The government failed to prove he deliberately falsified a 
security clearance application he submitted in July 2003. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On August 23, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="05-01927.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges security concerns under Guideline J (criminal conduct) and Guideline E (personal conduct). Applicant submitted responses to the SOR that were 
received by DOHA on October 3, 2005, and November 4, 2005. He admitted all Guideline J allegations, denied all Guideline E allegations, and requested a 
decision based on the written record without a hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January, 24, 2006, that was mailed to Applicant on January 26, 2006. Applicant 
acknowledged receipt of the FORM on February 2, 2006. He thereafter did not object to anything contained in the FORM or submit additional information for 
consideration within the 30-day period provided to him. The case was assigned to me March 17, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the various SOR allegations are incorporated herein. Additionally, after a thorough review of the record,<A HREF="05-01927.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> I make the following 
findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 39-year-old man who presumably is employed by a defense contractor in some capacity.<A HREF="05-01927.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> From February 1998 until sometime after he submitted 
a security clearance application in July 2003, Applicant was employed as a "cleaner" by two different employers outside the defense industry. Applicant 
married a citizen of Colombia in February 2003. In August 2004, he claimed he had separated from her in November 2003 and was planning on obtaining a 
divorce. The present status of his marriage is unknown, as is his contact and/or relationship with any of her relatives who may or may not reside in Colombia.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admitted he spent a weekend in jail and was sentenced to time served in about 1989 for jumping a subway turnstile. He admits, and his arrest record 
discloses, he was arrested for criminal trespass 2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>nd</SUP> and criminal possession of controlled substance on August 23, 1991. The only explanation about this offense 
is contained in Applicant's response to the SOR in which he states he went into an empty apartment after his mother threw him out. The nature of the controlled 
substance and the disposition of the offenses are unknown.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admitted he was charged with and found guilty of 6</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>th</SUP> degree larceny and fined $135.00 as alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.c. However, he listed the 
date of the charge as December 3, 1989, vice December 3, 1998, as alleged in the SOR. In a statement he provided in August 2004, Applicant stated he was 
never in the city where the alleged offense occurred in 1998, and that he had never been arrested in that state before 2000. The FORM also contains a 
handwritten court document prepared by an unknown individual in a clerk's office that lists the date of this offense as December 3, 1998. The basis for the 
information written on the form is unknown. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admitted he was arrested on or about September 8, 2000, charged with 6</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>th</SUP> degree larceny, found guilty, and fined $185.00. He denies ever entering 
the store from which the shirts in issue were stolen, and claims instead to have purchased the shirts from an individual without knowing they had been stolen. 
He also claimed the only reason he pled guilty was because he didn't want to hire an attorney and take more time off from work.     </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The FORM contains a portion of a security clearance application (SF 86) that was apparently submitted by or on behalf of Applicant on or about July 23, 2003 
(Item 4). Missing from the SF 86 are the question inquiring about additional remarks, the warning that the answers provided were subject to the provisions of 
18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001, and the signature page. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The SF 86 contains the answer "No" in response to question 26, inquiring about arrests, charges, and convictions that occurred in the preceding seven years. 
Applicant's 1998 conviction, assuming that is the correct date of the offense, and his 2000 conviction should have been disclosed in response to this question. 
In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied he deliberately failed to disclose his arrest history and went on to state he didn't remember what happened in 
1989. In a statement he provided in August 2004 (Item 5), Applicant explained he forgot to list the  2000 arrest in the SF 86. In that same statement, Applicant 
denied he had been arrested in 1998 as alleged. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">SOR subparagraph 1.d alleges Applicant falsified the SF 86 by answering "No" in response to question 37, inquiring about unpaid judgments in the preceding 
seven years. Applicant's credit report dated July 18, 2005, discloses a judgment was entered against him in December 1999. He admitted the judgment 
remained unpaid in his response to the SOR. However, he denied that he deliberately failed to disclose the judgement in the SF 86 and the FORM contains no 
other information about this allegation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">SOR subparagraph 1.a alleges Applicant falsified the SF 86 by answering "No" in response to question 20, inquiring about being fired from employment. While 
the SOR alleges he was fired from a job in 2001, there is no information in the FORM to substantiate that allegation. SOR subparagraph 1.c. alleges Applicant 
falsified the SF 86 by answering "No" in response to question 27 inquiring about his use of controlled substances in the preceding seven years. The SOR then 
goes on to allege he used marijuana from 1996 until 1999, but the FORM does not contain any information to substantiate that allegation.       </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline J, 
pertaining to criminal conduct, and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their  respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="05-01927.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="05-01927.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence,<A HREF="05-01927.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="05-01927.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="05-01927.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="05-01927.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-01927.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="05-01927.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="05-01927.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="05-01927.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM>Criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. 
Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior indicates an individual 
may be inclined to break rules.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was convicted of and sentenced for the relatively minor criminal offenses alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d. Although the disposition of 
the charges alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.b are unknown, Applicant's explanation about the allegation sufficiently establishes he at least committed the 
alleged trespass. DC1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>; and DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious 
crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM> apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant denied he intentionally falsified the SF 86 that was submitted. The SF 86 in the file, for unknown reasons, does not contain the question that provides 
space for explanations, the 18 U.S.C. 1001 warnings, or a signature page containing Applicant's certification that the answers were true, complete, and correct. 
It does, however, contain an authorization for release of information signed by Applicant on July 23, 2003. There is no basis in the record for speculation on the 
reason for the omissions from the SF 86, or what they might or might not reveal if they were included. The burden is on the government to prove controverted 
facts, and the government is the party that would be expected to possess the missing information. The omitted material creates uncertainty about the status and 
content of the SF 86 at the time it was allegedly submitted by Applicant. Accordingly, I cannot find the government has met its burden to produce record 
evidence to support the SOR subparagraph 1.e allegation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's last criminal offense occurred in September 2000, and there is no indication he has engaged in any criminal conduct since that time. Mitigating 
Condition (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The criminal behavior was not recent</EM> applies. Considering the minor nature of the criminal offenses Applicant committed, as particularly 
evidenced by the minimal fines that were imposed for the most recent offenses, and the length of time since Applicant's last criminal conduct, I find he has 
mitigated the security concern caused by his criminal conduct. Guideline J is decided for Applicant.     </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The FORM is devoid of any information to support the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 2.a and 2.c. Those allegations are decided for Applicant 
without further comment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">While Applicant's credit report discloses a judgment was entered against him in December 1999, and he admitted in his response to the SOR that the judgment 
remained unpaid, he denied he deliberately failed to disclose the existence of the judgment in the SF 86. Additionally, there is an incorrect answer to the 
question inquiring about arrests in the SF 86. When asked about the omission, Applicant stated he forgot to list the arrest. Again, in his response to the SOR, 
Applicant denied he deliberately failed to disclose the arrest and conviction.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">To meet its burden to prove Applicant deliberately provided false information in the SF 86, the government submitted a partial copy of the SF 86 it claims was 
falsified. Significantly omitted from the government's evidence were the signature page and the question providing space for general remarks. Missing from the 
record evidence is proof that Applicant signed and approved the contents of the SF 86, that he certified the answers were true, complete, and correct, that he 
was advised of the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1001, or what information may have been provided in the space provided for general remarks.<A HREF="05-01927.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> Considering the 
deficiencies in the evidence submitted by the government, I cannot find that Applicant deliberately falsified the SF 86. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided for 
Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>
