</P>

<P>	On 29 April 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement
of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative
finding<A HREF="97-0259.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance
for Applicant. On 20 May 1997, Applicant answered the SOR and requested an administrative
decision on the record. On 16 July 1997, Applicant  responded to the Government's File of Relevant
aterial (FORM)--issued 17 July 1997; the record in this case closed 21 July 1997, the day the
response was received at DOHA. The case was initially assigned to another administrative judge,
but was reassigned to me on 15 September 1997 due to caseload considerations; I received the case
on 15 September 1997 to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or
revoked.</P>

<P>	The SOR is attached to this Decision and incorporated by reference.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Applicant admitted the  allegations of the SOR; accordingly I incorporate the admissions as
findings of fact.</P>

<P>	Applicant--a 51-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks to retain a top secret
clearance.</P>

<P>	Applicant has a history of sexual behavior which calls into question his judgment and
reliability. On several occasions between 1966 and 1986, Applicant solicited prostitutes.<A HREF="97-0259.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> From 1975
to 1992, Applicant engaged in an extramarital affair--apparently with the same woman. From the
date of his marriage until approximately 1986, Applicant went to a massage parlor about twice a
year--usually while on out-of-town business trips, but occasionally while at home. On about half
these visits, Applicant had the masseuse masturbate him or perform fellatio on him. Applicant
specifically recalled two sexual encounters in approximately June and August 1985.<A HREF="97-0259.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> Between 1986
and 1994, Applicant did not go to massage parlors. From 1994 to January 1997, Applicant went to
massage parlors eight times, each time for a massage and masturbation, once including fellatio.
Applicant's spouse and coworkers are not aware of his activities.<A HREF="97-0259.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> He figured that because the
massage parlors advertised in newspapers and telephone books, their activities were legal and posed
minimal health risks.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	Applicant has consistently asserted that he is not subject to coercion because of his sexual
activity. He asserts his good employment history and twenty-five years of proper handling classified
information as proof of his good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating
an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions
raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances
presented.  Each adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in
Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or
against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration
of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </P>

<P>	Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most
pertinent to this case:</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>SEXUAL BEHAVIOR (CRITERION D)</STRONG></U></CENTER>
	</P>

<P>	Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality
or emotional disorder, subjects the individual or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.<A HREF="97-0259.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(1) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been
prosecuted;</P>

<P>		(2) compulsive or addictive sexual behavior when the person is unable to stop a
pattern of self-destructive or high-risk behavior or that which is symptomatic of a personality
disorder;</P>

<P>		(3) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to undue influence or
coercion;</P>

<P>		(4) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which lacks of discretion or
judgment.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		(3) there is no other evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotional
instability.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.
If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to
establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient
to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise
doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden
of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under Criterion D. Applicant was involved in a
variety of sexual behaviors from 1968 to 1997. At times, the conduct has been criminal; at all times
the conduct has been indicative of poor judgment and has subjected Applicant to potential undue
influence or coercion. At times the conduct has been suggestive of a personality disorder.<A HREF="97-0259.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> The
massage parlor sexual activities are of a public nature and reflect a lack of discretion and judgment.
While there is no other evidence--aside of the sexual behavior--of questionable judgment,
irresponsibility, or emotional instability, the length of Applicant's sexual activities suggests a
continuing problem that casts considerable doubt on Applicant's fitness for access to classified
information.<A HREF="97-0259.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	Applicant's coworkers are unaware of his activities; I conclude that Applicant's spouse is
similarly unaware of the activities--or is at least unaware of the full nature and extent of Applicant's
activities. This subjects him to potential undue influence, notwithstanding his claims to the contrary.
His work record, or the fact that he has had a clearance for twenty-five years, does not overcome the
fact that for most of that time Applicant's sexual activities have subjected him to potential coercion.
Applicant's sexual activities over the last twenty-nine years are indicative of poor judgment and
unreliability. There is little evidence in the record to suggest that Applicant can or will put this
sexual conduct behind him, particularly where he resumed massage parlor visits after a substantial
hiatus<A HREF="97-0259.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A>. I find Criterion J. against Applicant.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January
2, 1992--and amended by Change 3 dated 16 February 1996  (Directive).
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>This conduct violated state criminal statues in the locations where the conduct occurred. After 1968, it also
occurred while Applicant was married.
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>In a sworn statement to the DIS in February 1986 (Item 6), Applicant stated an intent to refrain from going
to massage parlors to engage in sexual activity because of the health risks and his maturing sexual attitudes. Although
Applicant claimed that his spouse was aware that he went to massage parlors, he indicated that she was not aware of
the frequency of his visits, and it appears she was not aware of the sexual activity taking place on the visits.
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>In his answer to the SOR (Item 3), Applicant claims that in 1985 he told his spouse that he had visited massage
parlors. However, Applicant does not corroborate that claim; nor does he claim that he told his spouse about the sexual
activity. Further, Applicant confirms that his spouse is not aware of the massage parlor visits from 1994 to 1997.
Similarly, while Applicant claims that he told his spouse about the extramarital affair, there is no corroboration of this
claim, nor is there any evidence to indicate when Applicant told his spouse.
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>The adjudicative criteria also invites the adjudicator to consider the security guidelines under criminal conduct
(criteria J) or emotional disorders (criteria I) as appropriate in assessing conduct under this guideline.
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A>While there has been no formal diagnosis of a personality disorder (marital difficulties are not a disorder
recognized by the DSM IV), and the sexual behavior of Applicant does not appear to me to rise to the level of
compulsive or addictive behavior, I am nevertheless concerned that Applicant's return to massage parlor sexual
activities after a seven or eight year hiatus is indicative of a larger problem.
<P><A NAME="N_7_">7. </A>Although none of the specific activities runs the entire twenty-nine year period, I believe it is reasonable to
conclude that the different activities are sufficiently similar that they reasonably constitute a course of conduct.
<P><A NAME="N_8_">8. </A>Applicant's proffered explanations for why he resumed the sexual activity simply make no sense, and certainly
do not mitigate the poor judgment demonstrated by the activity.
