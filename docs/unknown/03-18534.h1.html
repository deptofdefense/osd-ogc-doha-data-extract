<P>Applicant is a technician for a defense contractor.  He was convicted of driving while intoxicated in 1983 and 1993.  He was convicted of domestic assault after 
consuming alcohol in 1996.  He admits to continuing to drink alcohol to excess and intoxication at least twice monthly.  Applicant has not mitigated security 
concerns for alcohol consumption.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On June 27, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a 
security clearance for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(February 20, 1990), 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (January 2, 1992), 
as amended and modified (Directive).  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 5, 2005.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline G 
(Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on July 25, 2005.  He admitted the allegations under Guideline G.  He elected to have the matter decided on the written 
record in lieu of a hearing.</P> 
<P>Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on August 31, 2005.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on 
September 27, 2005, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  He 
provided additional information on October 11, 2005, and Department Counsel had no objection to consideration of the additional information.  The case was 
assigned to me on November 28, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is 42 years old and employed as a technician by a defense contractor for over seven years.  He is married with no children.<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant admitted to 
two offenses for driving while intoxicated, a conviction for domestic violence involving consumption of alcohol, and drinking to the point of intoxication twice 
per month.<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>While serving on active duty in the Air Force, Applicant received non-judicial punishment on March 22, 1983 for driving while intoxicated.  He was reduced in 
grade, which was suspended for six months, fined $150.00, and ordered to perform extra duty.<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant was charged with and convicted of driving while 
intoxicated on November 16, 1993. He was sentenced to serve one day in jail.<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Applicant objects to using these offenses since they happened over 10 and 20 
years ago.<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant was charged with and convicted of domestic violence on January 10, 1996, and fined $300.00 and court costs.  The conviction was set aside after he 
served his sentence.<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Applicant  admitted the offense happened after he consumed alcohol,<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> but noted that he was not intoxicated.<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant admits to the consumption of alcohol to the point of intoxication twice monthly.  Applicant questions the definition of "to the point of intoxication."  
He states:</P> 
<P>"My understanding by Law/DPS Sheriff's Department is that .05 is legally intoxicated.  This is what I used as a base (being honest) for my understanding of 
admitting to drinking to the point of intoxication twice a month.  I was under the understanding that if I had more than 3 or 4 cocktails/beverages in an evening 
that this was considered intoxication.  I rarely have any alcohol during the week days due to responsibilities at work.  On weekends, on occasion of 'BBQ's and 
Friends' the consumption of beverages could increase (per weekend)."<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant's supervisor submitted a letter of recommendation.  The supervisor noted Applicant has waited for over five years for the adjudication of his security 
clearance.  He has know Applicant for a number of years and considers him a good man and a loyal American.<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently 
trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant 
meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each guideline.  Each 
clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, 
and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</P> 
<P>The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security 
clearance.  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable information about the 
person.<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to 
include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the  
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the 
Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible 
for access to classified information.<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  Thereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  "[T]he Directive 
presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  "Any 
doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." <A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
<P>Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption: A security concerns exists because excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, 
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the 
SOR.</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline G.  Applicant's two driving while intoxicated arrests and convictions, his conviction for domestic 
violence after consuming alcohol, and his admitted present use of alcohol to the point of intoxication twice a month supports application of Alcohol 
Consumption Disqualifying Conditions E2.A7.1.2.1 (<EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence . . . )</EM>, and 
E2.A7.1.2.5 (<EM>Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment</EM>).  The three criminal offenses are alcohol related-incidents away from 
work.  His present twice monthly drinking to the point of intoxication is habitual or binge drinking.  Binge drinking is a pattern of drinking alcohol that brings 
the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to .08 or above.  For the typical adult, this pattern corresponds to consuming 5 or more drinks (male), or 4 or more 
drinks (female), in about 2 hours.<A HREF="03-18534.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  Applicant admits to twice monthly drinking alcohol to the point of intoxication and having at least three or four drinks in an 
evening when he becomes intoxicated.  His admitted twice monthly intoxication, even though he may minimize the amount of alcohol consumed, establishes 
the binge drinking.  Since his consumption of alcohol is consistent and frequent it is also considered habitual.  Applicant has not presented any information that 
his consumption of alcohol does not lead to impaired judgment.</P> 
<P><EM></EM>I have considered Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions E2.A7.1.3.1 (<EM>The alcohol-related incidents do not indicte a pattern</EM>); E2.A7.1.3.2 (<EM>The problem 
occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem</EM>); and E2.A7.1.3.3 (<EM>Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</EM>); 
Applicant's alcohol-related arrests indicate a pattern since alcohol was involved in each of them.  Even though the incidents were 22, 12, and 9 years ago, 
Applicant's admission of continued drinking to the point of intoxication twice monthly indicates there is a recent problem.  His continued drinking to 
intoxication is not behavior that supports a finding of sobriety.  I conclude Applicant has not presented sufficient information to meet his burden to mitigate the 
security concerns for alcohol consumption.</P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept.  I considered Applicant's supervisor's statement concerning Applicant's 
work performance and his evaluation of Applicant' character.  I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</P> 
<P>Paragraph 1, Guideline G   AGAINST APPLICANT</P> 
<P>Subparagraph 1.a.:    Against Applicant</P> 
<P>Subparagraph 1.b.:    Against Applicant</P> 
<P>Subparagraph 1.c.:    Against Applicant</P> 
<P>Subparagraph 1.d.:    Against Applicant</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>In light of all of the circumstances in the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.  Clearance is denied.</P>
