</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On December 8, 2004, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="04-09783.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="04-09783.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 
December 30, 2004,</SPAN> and requested his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) 
on April 6, 2005.  The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 11.  By letter dated April 11, 2005, a copy of the FORM was forwarded to 
Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on April 22, 2005, 
and his response was due May 23, 2005.  Applicant did not submit a response to the FORM. On June 22, 2005, the case was assigned to me for a decision.  </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains two allegations of disqualifying conduct charged under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and four allegations charged under Guideline F, 
Financial Considerations.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted one allegation and admitted in part and denied in part five allegations.  His admissions 
are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is 45years old and has worked for his present employer, a defense contractor, since 1987.  He was granted a security clearance in 1993.  (Item 5.)</P> 
<P>Applicant married in 1982, and he and his wife are the parents of three children.  Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF-86) in August 2003.  
His wife filled in the information on the form, and he signed it without checking it for accuracy.  He stated: "I did not know it [the SF-86] was falsified, because 
I did not check it after my wife filled it out." (Item 3, at 1.) Applicant said that when he filed his SF-86, he and his wife were living beyond their means.  (Item 
3)  Applicant's wife became sick in 2003, and he was so worried about the state of her health he didn't think about paying his debts.  (Item 3; Item 8.)</P> 
<P>Applicant has a history of financial problems and financial instability.  In 1991, he petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  His debts of approximately $9,142 
were discharged by the bankruptcy court on May 17, 1991.  (Item 4.)  Applicant filed for bankruptcy on the advice of his wife, who told him she thought it was 
the only way they could relieve themselves of their debts.  Applicant stated in December 2004 that he and his wife were planning to obtain a divorce.</P> 
<P>In March, 2004, Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> provided a signed, sworn statement to a special agent of the Defense Security Service.  Included with the signed, sworn statement 
was Applicant's personal financial statement indicating a total net monthly income of $3,424, total monthly expenses of $3,366, and a net remainder of $58.<A HREF="04-09783.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  
Applicant acknowledged six bad debts totaling approximately $13,076.  One of the bad debts, listed at $489, had been paid.  Applicant had no scheduled 
payments to reduce amounts owed on the remaining five debts.  (Item 8.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his answers to Questions 38 and 39 on his SF-86, Applicant denied financial delinquencies of over 180 days in the last seven years and any current financial 
delinquencies of over 90 days.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted a bad debt of $170 that was at least 120 days delinquent as of August 2003.  (Ex. 6.)  Applicant said he intended to pay the account but kept 
putting it off.  (Item 3.)  The debt was not paid until June 28, 2004  (Item 9.)  He admitted a debt of approximately $9,731 for an account charged off in 
approximately August 1998.  He said he thought the debt had been discharged in his 1991 bankruptcy, and he didn't find out it had not been discharged until 
1999. Then, he didn't "bother to find out what it was until 2003."  On December 30, 2004, he said he had started to make arrangements to pay off the debt.  
(Item 3.)  Applicant also admitted a debt of approximately $150 on an account placed for collection by a cable company in July 2000.  He said he was not aware 
the debt had gone unpaid for four years.  (Item 3.)  Applicant also admitted not paying a debt of $1,061, owed to a towing company, that had been placed for 
collection in about December 2001.  He claimed he no longer owed the vehicle when it was towed.  (Item 3.)  He presented a document purporting to be a 
notice of transfer and release of liability for an automobile sale dated October 23, 2001.  (Item 9)  On March 8, 2004, he admitted the towing debt was his in a 
signed, sworn statement to a special agent of the Defense Investigative Service.  (Item 8.)</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant deliberately falsified his answers on his SF-86 to Questions 38 and 39 while knowing he owed a debt of $170 to a jeweler 
that was at least 120 days delinquent as of August 2003 and not satisfied until June 28, 2004 (&para; 1.a (1)) and while knowing he owed three creditors, identified in 
allegations at &para;&para; 2.b., 2.c., and 2.d. of the SOR, for obligations charged off as bad debts or placed for collection in 1998, 2000, and 2001 and which remained 
unsatisfied as of November 2004 (&para; 1.a.(2)).  Applicant denied knowingly falsifying his answers to Questions 38 and 39 and asserted he entrusted the 
responsibility of preparing his SF-86 to his wife, who falsified his answers.  He admitted not checking the accuracy of the answers his wife prepared for him.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant's responsibility to provide truthful and complete responses to questions on his or her SF-86 cannot be delegated to another person.  Applicant had 
been granted a security clearance in 1993, and he was familiar with an applicant's responsibility to  answer all questions on his SF-86  truthfully and 
completely.  Truthful answers to Questions 38 and 39 are important because an applicant's financial history is material to a determination of his security 
worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.a.(1) and 1.a.(2), Applicant's argument that it was his wife and not Applicant who 
falsified his SF-86 is not persuasive. Applicant delegated to his wife  his responsibility to provide relevant and material information about his debts and 
financial obligations in his responses to Questions 38 and 39.  His wife provided false answers to Questions 38 and 39, and Applicant did not review his wife's 
answers for accuracy.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had a history of financial delinquencies dating back to at least 1991, when he and his wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and he was not unfamiliar 
with the demands of creditors for payment.  On August 22, 2003, Applicant signed his SF-86 and attested to the truthfulness, completeness, and correctness of 
his statements. <EM> See </EM>Item 5, at 8.  He concealed information that increased his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's conduct thus falls under disqualifying conditions E2.A5.1.2.2. and E2.A5.1.2.4. of the Personal Conduct Guideline.  His denial of financial 
delinquencies of over 180 days in the previous seven years and current delinquencies of over 90 days was pertinent to a determination of his judgment, 
trustworthiness and reliability.  The falsifications were recent and not isolated incidents, and Applicant did not subsequently provide correct information 
voluntarily.  He did not make prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts, and he has not taken positive steps to 
significantly reduce or eliminate his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.  Thus, mitigating conditions E2.A5.1.3.1., E2.A5.1.3.2., E2.A5.1.3.3., and 
E2.A5.1.3.5. do not apply.  His deliberate misrepresentations cause serious security concerns.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that an applicant may not properly safeguard 
classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in the SOR, the Government has established its case.  Accordingly, the allegations in subparagraphs 1.a.(1) and 
1.a. (2) of the SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Government's concern under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, is that individuals who are financially overextended and unable or unwilling to pay 
their just debts may try to generate funds by engaging in illegal acts.  Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations, and his financial history 
suggests an inability or unwillingness to satisfy his debts, conditions which raise security concerns under subparagraphs E2.A6.1.2.1. and E2.A6.1.2.3. of 
Guideline F.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  DOHA's Appeal Board has concluded that "[a] person who is unwilling to fulfill his legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of 
good judgment and reliability required of persons granted access to classified information."  ISCR Case No. 98-0810 at 4 (App. Bd. June 8, 2000).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged that Applicant petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection on January 10, 1991 and that his debts of approximately $9,142 were 
discharged by the bankruptcy court on May 17, 1991 (&para; 2.a.); that he owed a creditor approximately $9,731 for an account charged off in approximately 1998 
and that, as of November 17, 2004, the debt had not been satisfied (&para; 2.b.); that he owed a creditor approximately $150 for an account placed for collection in 
July 2000, and that, as of November 17, 2004, the debt had not been satisfied (&para; 2.c.); and that he owed a towing company approximately $1,061 on an account 
placed for collection in about December 2001, and that, as of November 5, 2004, the debt had not been satisfied (&para; 2.d.).  An applicant who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the account identified in &para; 2.b. of the SOR.  He said the account should have been included in his 1991 
bankruptcy, that he didn't learn it was not included until 1999, and that he didn't investigate the matter further until 2003.  He admitted the debt identified in &para; 
2.c. of the SOR.  He said he did not know it had gone unpaid for four years.  He said he had satisfied the debt but was not in good standing with the creditor.  
He admitted the debt identified in &para; 2.d. of the SOR and said he was contesting the debt because it was for towing a car he didn't own at the time of the towing.  
In his signed, sworn statement to a special agent of the Defense Investigative Service, dated March 8, 2004, Applicant admitted the debts identified at &para;&para; 2.b. 
and 2.d. of the SOR and identified them as bad debts for which he had not scheduled payment.  (Item 8, at 2.)  In a November 5, 2004 response to 
interrogatories from DOHA regarding his financial situation, Applicant attached a document identified as notice of transfer and release of liability, dated 
October 23, 2001, to support his claim he did not owe the debt to the towing company.  (Item 9, at 10.)  He did not supply evidence to show that the car he sold 
in October 2001 was the car towed by the towing company which resulted in the debt identified at &para; 2.d. of the SOR..  The Government has established, through 
the FORM and Applicant's admissions, a <EM>prima facie</EM> case that Applicant is financially overextended.  Applicant provided no persuasive evidence to rebut the 
financial concerns specified in the SOR and identified as disqualifying conditions under &para;&para; E2.A6.1.2.1. and E2.A6.1.2.3. of Guideline F.<A HREF="04-09783.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We turn to a review of the several conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant's financial delinquencies.  Applicant's acknowledged 
delinquencies involve long-standing debts; some continue to be unsatisfied to this day.  Thus, neither mitigating condition E2.A.6.1.3.1. nor mitigating 
condition E2.A6.1.3.2. applies.  If a person's financial delinquencies were largely caused by conditions beyond his control, then mitigating condition 
E2.A6.1.3.3. might apply.  While Applicant's wife fell ill with a serious illness in 2003, this circumstance, while unfortunate, does not explain or mitigate his 
long-standing financial difficulties which predate 2003.  Thus, mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.3. does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record evidence does not establish that Applicant has sought counseling for his financial problems.  Additionally, he failed to demonstrate he had initiated a 
good-faith effort to pay his creditors or to resolve or bring under control his financial delinquencies.  Thus, mitigating conditions E2.A6.1.3.4. and E2.A6.1.3.6. 
do not apply to the facts of Applicant's case.  Accordingly, the allegations in &para;&para; 2.a. through 2.d. of the SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  Security clearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose 
further punishment for past transgressions.  Rather, the objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his or 
her acts and omissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct.  Having done so, I conclude Applicant should not be entrusted with a security 
clearance.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors and guidelines in Department of Defense 
Directive, 5220.6, as amended. </SPAN></P>
