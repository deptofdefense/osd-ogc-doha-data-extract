<P>Applicant mitigated foreign preference concerns after he returned his Bulgarian passport and took steps to renounce his citizenship and his pension.  Under a 
whole person analysis he also mitigated foreign influence security concerns over bonds to his parents, brother, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, and friends who 
are citizens of Bulgaria and reside there.  Applicant has strong ties to the U.S. as a resident here for nine years and a naturalized citizen for three.  Applicant's 
assurances that he would contact appropriate U.S. officials if any pressure were attempted are credible and are bolstered by his supervisor's positive assessment 
of his exemplary work and of him as a very loyal and trustworthy person.  He had no intent to willfully falsify by omissions on his security clearance 
application, so personal conduct concerns do not remain.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="03-18233.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> to the Applicant on November 19, 2004.  The SOR detailed 
reasons why the Government could not find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to classified information.  The SOR alleges 
specific concerns in paragraph 1 over foreign preference (Guideline C), in paragraph 2 over foreign influence (Guideline B), and in paragraph 3 over personal 
conduct (Guideline e).  Applicant replied to the SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on December 9, 2004, where he requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>After Department Counsel stated the case was ready to proceed on February 16, 2005, the case was assigned to me on February 17, 2005.  On June 7, 2005, 
DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing and set this case to be heard on June 27, 2005, in a city near where Applicant lives and works.  At the hearing the 
government presented three exhibits (Exhibits 1-3) which were admitted into evidence without objection.   Department Counsel's request that administrative 
notice (AN) be taken of the information contained in Exhibits I - III was granted as Applicant's counsel did not object. </P> 
<P>Applicant's counsel called two witness and offered five exhibits (Exhibits A-E).  Department Counsel did not object to Exhibits A-E which were admitted into 
evidence.  The transcript (TR) was received on July 14, 2005.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional Findings of 
Fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant, 52 years old, has worked for a defense contractor (Employer #1) in State #1 since February 2000.  On May 16, 2002 he completed a Security 
Clearance Application (Standard Form 86).  (Answer; Exhibits 1, 2; TR 42)</P> 
<P>Applicant studied at a U.S. university in a Ph.D. program in State #2 from 1998 to 2000.  (Exhibit 1; TR 50)  Earlier he had studied at a university in Bulgaria 
and received an undergraduate degree and the equivalent of a masters degree in physics in March 1980.  (Exhibit 2)  He married his first wife in 1978 and was 
divorced in 1990.  He has a child born in 1980 in Bulgaria.  He married his second wife in 1992; she became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 2002.  (Exhibit 
1)  Applicant's wife is in the U.S., but remains a dual citizen. She works at a university in State #1.  She remains a dual citizen with a small property interest in 
Bulgaria.  Applicant's daughter has resided in Canada since the early 1990's and is a dual citizen of the Bulgaria and Canada.  She was granted a green card in 
April 2005 and plans to move to the U.S.  (Exhibits 1, 2; Answer; TR 48-49; 75)  </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence</STRONG> </CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Born in Bulgaria, Applicant became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. in April 2002.  (Exhibits 1,  2; TR 34)  Before he came to the U.S. he spent two years from 
1969 to 1971 in mandatory military service in the army of Bulgaria as a private.  His subsequent employment was with the Bulgarian Academy of Science 
(BAS) from 1981 to 1996 where he did research which  had no military applications.  He earned a pension allowance for his 15 years of employment, but he did 
not know if he would still qualify for it when he renounces his Bulgarian citizenship.  He plans not to collect this pension.  (Exhibits, 1, 2, &amp; 3; TR 36-37, 43-45; 71-74)</P> 
<P>Applicant was not politically active in Bulgaria.  During that period from 1981 to 1996 he resisted pressure to join the Bulgarian Communist Party as he did not 
share those views.  In 1994 during the democratic changes in Bulgaria he briefly joined one of the new parties in favor of democracy and a free market 
economy.  After the changes in government in Bulgaria in the early 1990's, his organization the BAS was downsized as there was no longer government 
funding.  He began his own successful business, but decided to try to move to the U.S. In 1996 both he and his wife were accepted as U.S. resident aliens. They 
moved to State #2 where Applicant had a friend.  In 2000 he sought employment and moved to State #1.  They own a home they purchased in February 2002.  
(Exhibit 2; TR 36-41)</P> 
<P>At the time he became a U.S. citizen he understood that Bulgaria did recognize dual citizenship; so he was a dual citizen of the U.S. and Bulgaria.  After he 
learned of security concerns at his security interview in September 2002, he wrote to the Bulgarian Embassy to learn the procedures on renouncing his 
Bulgarian citizenship.  He delayed as he learned he could not legally own property in Bulgaria unless he was a citizen; he and his brother each hold a half 
interest in an apartment valued at $10,000 where their parents reside.  He stated in December 2003 that the property was then valued at $25,000.  Applicant 
intended to sell or transfer this property before he renounced his Bulgarian citizenship; however, his parents objected to any change, so he still maintains an 
interest in this property; his parents pay taxes on it.  Under his parents' will he was also to inherit another apartment worth approximately $6,000.  His parents 
remain in the property so he is unable to sell it.  His is prepared to renounce his interest in these properties.  (Exhibits 2, 3; Answer; TR 45-47; 64-66, 73; 84-85)</P> 
<P>At that time of the DSS interview in September 2002 he had a valid Bulgarian passport effective December 2000 to December 2005.  However, he had not used 
his Bulgarian passport since becoming a U.S. citizen.  He has acquired a U.S. passport for travel.  He went to Bulgaria from November to December 2002 on 
his U.S. passport to visit his parents.  He also attempted to renounce his Bulgarian citizen and surrender his passport. Immediately after his DSS interview in 
August 20002 he attempted to renounce his Bulgarian citizenship, but found several administrative barriers both here and in Bulgaria.  In January 2003 the 
Special Certificate of Naturalization was sent to Bulgaria.  Six months later he learned the forms had been lost, so he began the process again in August 2004.  
He has forwarded all the documents needed to renounce his Bulgarian citizenship.  He was waiting to return his passport after he received a request from the 
Bulgarian government as part of his efforts to renounce his citizenship there.  In December 2004 he initiated the action; and he and his wife returned their 
passports to the Bulgarian Consulate. (Exhibits 2, 3; Answer; Exhibits A,  D; TR 27-30; 59-63)</P> 
<P>Applicant's father, mother, and one brother are citizens of Bulgaria and live there.  His parents visited in the U.S. in 1997.   His father is 82 and retired from his 
work as an engineer that built engines for commercial use.  His mother is 81 and was a homemaker who did work as an elementary school teacher.  They never 
had any ties to the government.  Applicant provided them from $300 to $1,000 per year depending on their needs.  In 2004 he provided no money to them.  His 
brother born in 1949 is a pilot for a private aviation company.  He talks with his parents weekly and with his brother on a weekly to monthly basis.  (Exhibits 1, 
2; Answer; TR 35-37, 41-44; 87-68)</P> 
<P>His mother-in-law is a Bulgarian national who is retired from a chemical laboratory at a sugar processing plan and lives on a pension.  He is in touch on a yearly 
basis; she visited the U.S. in 2000, 2002 and 2005.  In the past he and his wife sent her about $1,000 per year.  Recently, they have sent $700 per year.  His 
wife's brother serves in the Bulgarian army.  Applicant's wife attended his wedding in Bulgaria in 2001; Applicant occasionally speaks to him.  (Exhibit 2; 
Answer; TR 69-71, 76, 81)</P> 
<P>He maintains a friendship with a professor in Belgium who is a former high school classmate; he visited Applicant in 2000 while he was in the U.S. for a 
conference.  He also maintains a friendship with a chemist who is at the BAS and is a Bulgarian national.  He also remains a friend of a person he met in the 
military who studied engineering and was at one time a member of the Bulgarian Communist Party to advance his career.  However, he has only talked with 
him twice in  three years, saw him in 2002 when he visited Bulgaria, and has not spoken to him in three years.  (Exhibits 1, 2; Answer; 77-78)</P> 
<P>If he were ever pressured to act against the national security interests of the U.S. directly or through a family member, he would immediately report the situation 
to the appropriate security officials.   (Exhibit 2)</P> 
<P>Bulgaria is now a parliamentary democracy and adopted a constitution in 1991.  It has a market-based economy.  While the Government generally respects the 
human rights of citizens, there are problems in several areas according to the 2003 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.  The U.S. and Bulgaria have 
had bilateral relations for 100 years except for a period from 1950-60.  After the fall of communism the relationship improved dramatically and the U.S. has 
encouraged a multi-party democracy and a market economy.  The U.S. signed a Bilateral Investment Treaty in 1994 and gave Bulgaria most-favored-nation 
trade status in October 1996.  The Government conceded that Bulgaria has assisted with forces in Iraq and is a U.S. ally on friendly terms.  (AN I, II, III; TR 
117-118)   </P> 
<P>Applicant credibly established that even if someone were pressuring his family, he would not surrender to that kind of pressure.  As his immediate family has 
no ties to the government, it is less likely that there is any identified risk associated with his family in Bulgaria.  While his wife's brother is in the Bulgarian 
Army, he has a technical position; and Applicant has limited contact with him.  Also, Applicant and his supervisor established his trustworthiness and loyalty to 
the United States. Given Applicant's extensive ties to the U.S. with his immediate family in the U.S. and his substantial financial assets in the U.S., I conclude 
it is unlikely he would yield to pressure if any of these relatives were coerced by  the government of Bulgaria.  There is no indication in the record that Bulgaria 
engages in economic or other espionage against the U.S.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
<P>When he completed his SF-86 in 2002, Applicant established credibly that he had no intent to falsify the form and fully cooperated with DSS and provided 
answers to these questions in his interview.  With respect to question 11 on his military history he established that he misunderstood the question.  In 1996 he 
provided INS with a copy of his miliary record. He had no intent to falsify and was confused as other subparts of the question referred to service in the U.S. 
military.  He disclosed this foreign military service in his DSS interview when he understood the question. Applicant established that he had no intent to falsify 
question 12 on foreign activities - property when he completed his SF-86.  Since his parents live in the property that was transferred to him and his brother to 
avoid inheritance tax, he still considered his parents the owner and had no intent to falsify.  He fully disclosed his property interests in Bulgaria in his DSS 
interview.  Applicant credibly established that he had no intent to falsify question 13 on foreign activities - employment when he completed his SF-86 as he 
fully disclosed his employment in Bulgaria under Question 4, employment activities, and did not understand he should list it again.  He fully discussed his work 
in the DSS interview.  (Exhibits 1, 2; Answer; Exhibit E; TR 22-27, 30-33, 50-58; 82-84)</P>

</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a 
consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant adjudication guidelines as set forth below:</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline C - Foreign Preference</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P></P> 
<P><STRONG>E2.A3.1.1.  The concern: When an  individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or 
she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</STRONG></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>B - Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><STRONG>E2.A2.1.1.  The concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or 
she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2)  may be subject to duress.  These situations 
could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries 
or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><STRONG><EM>E2.A5.1.1.  The Concern</EM>:  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></P> 
<P>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching a fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Preference</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant has mitigated the Government's security concerns over his possible preference for a foreign country over the United States.   While Applicant 
continued to possess his foreign passport after he became a naturalized U.S. citizen, he never used his foreign passport when he traveled to Bulgaria in 2002, 
but instead used his U.S. passport exclusively. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:  E2.A3.1.2.2.  Possession and/or 
use<A HREF="03-18233.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN> of a foreign passport and E2.A3.1.2.4.  Accepting educational, medical, or other benefits, such as retirement and social welfare, from a foreign country.  
Under DC 2 &amp; 4 this disqualifying conduct raises a security concern over his possible preference for Bulgaria over the U.S.  The possession of a foreign 
passport could allow Applicant to travel without accountability and outside the ambit of U.S. immigration controls which raises concerns when someone has 
access to U.S. classified information.  Further, he is eligible to receive a Bulgarian Government pension of approximately $800 a year when he turns 63 years 
old.</P> 
<P> Applicant has mitigated<A HREF="03-18233.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> these security concerns.  With respect to his dual citizenship, initially, Applicant did not understand and was unsure how to proceed to 
comply with the security requirements of the OASDC3I memorandum of August 16, 2000.  Once Applicant understood the U.S. security concerns over his 
retaining his foreign citizenship, he immediately expressed his willingness to surrender his passport and renounce his citizenship.  After several procedural 
missteps, he returned his passport to the Bulgarian Consulate in December 2004 and began the formal steps to renounce his citizenship.  Also, he has credibly 
stated his intent to renounce his Bulgarian pension as well to sever any ongoing connections to Bulgaria.</P> 
<P>As the Appeal Board established in ISCR Case No. 03-11765 (April 11, 2005) at 14, "Given the wording of Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 4, the 
absence of evidence that Applicant's application for renunciation of . . . citizenship has been approved did not preclude the Administrative Judge from applying 
that mitigating condition."  Thus, his actions in demonstrating his willingness to renounce his Bulgarian citizenship by filing the appropriate paperwork 
establishes he does not prefer the interests of another country over those of the U.S. </P> 
<P>Having weighed the record evidence as a whole under the other factors outlined in Directive, I conclude Applicant's disqualifying conduct was not undertaken 
in such a way as to establish his preference for a foreign country over the U.S.  Additionally, considering the totality of the evidence, I conclude that there is 
little, if any, probability Applicant will someday reacquire his Bulgarian passport and use it instead of his U.S. passport.   Applicant has lived and worked in this 
country continuously since 1996.  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002 and has demonstrated  a strong  preference for the U.S. over any other foreign 
nation by giving up his Bulgarian citizenship.</P> 
<P>Therefore, I conclude Guideline C for Applicant.  Thus, favorable findings are warranted with respect to subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c. of the SOR.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Influence</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
<P>Because of Applicant's family ties in Bulgaria the government raised foreign influence concerns under disqualifying conditions (DC):  E2.A2.1.2. 1.  An 
immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country; and E2.A2.1.2.6. Conduct which may make the individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a foreign government; and E2.A2.1.2.8. 
A substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign-owned or -operated business that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence.  
Applicant has parents, a brother, and a mother-in-law and brother-in-law who are citizens of Bulgaria and currently reside there.  He also has limited contact 
with two friends who remain in Bulgaria.  The Government established through the documents they submitted for administrative notice (AN I-III)  the U.S. and 
Bulgaria have a strong bi-lateral relationship, though obviously they will not have identical interests over vital matters.</P> 
<P>While I have seriously considered these security concerns and the documents submitted for administrative notice on Bulgaria, I conclude Applicant has 
presented sufficient evidence to meet the burden these circumstances present.  Applicant mitigated<A HREF="03-18233.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> the Government's security concerns over possible foreign 
influence. In evaluating the relevance of his conduct, I considered the following Adjudication Process factors: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E.2.21.1.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; E2.2.1.2. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; 
E2.2.1.3.  The frequency and recency of the conduct; E2.2.1.4.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; E2.2.1.5.  The voluntariness of the 
participation; E2.2.1.6.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; E.2.2.1.7.  The motivation for the conduct; E.2.2.1.8.  
The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and E.2.2.1.9.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  (E.2.2. Adjudication Process)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Looking at all of these circumstances, I conclude Applicant has overcome  foreign influence  security concerns.  Given his strong ties to the U.S. with his 
immediate family in the U.S. and a majority of his assets in the U.S., Applicant established that there is little likelihood that he would submit to any potential 
pressure on his family who remain in Bulgaria.  One indication is that even when the Communist Party controlled Bulgaria and controlled and financed the 
organization where he worked for fifteen years, he resisted pressures and did not join the Communist Party even though others did so to advance their careers.  
That action indicates his independent character.  Both the FSO and president of his company as well as a family friend vouch for his allegiance to the U.S. and 
his trustworthiness.  Thus, I conclude there is limited potential for coercion, exploitation or duress. (E.2.2.1.8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, 
or duress.)   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While his and his wife's family members remain citizens and residents of Bulgaria, only his wife's brother has ties to the government; and he is in a technical 
role in the military.  Applicant has been a naturalized U.S. citizen for three years and has been a resident of the U.S. for nine years where he pursued an 
advanced academic degree.  He has had only one visit with his family in Bulgaria in 2002 when he traveled there to try to renounce his interest in his parent's 
property.  While he was unsuccessful in divesting himself of that interest as his parents still live in the property, he will do so as soon as he is in a position to do 
so.  His property interests there are minimal compared to his U.S. assets as he owns a house in the U.S. and is a shareholder in his company.  While he has 
provided economic support to his and his wife's family members, the amount has been minimal.  Indeed, he has stopped providing any support for his parents.  
He no longer has contact with his friends in Bulgaria since his last visit there in 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, he credibly established he would put his interests in the U.S. ahead of any loyalty to his birth family as he exclusively used his U.S. passport for the 
2002 visit after he became a naturalized U.S. citizen, as discussed above under foreign preference.  Further, it is unlikely that Bulgaria, a U.S. ally would risk 
threatening this relationship by threatening its private citizens for the purpose of forcing a U.S. citizen to betray the U.S. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As Applicant's supervisor and the FSO  established, Applicant has a substantial history with his employer since 2000 and is viewed as trustworthy.  His work is 
always excellent and led to him being offered stock in the company The president of the company and a family friend who has known him since 1996 
recommended him for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Thus, I conclude that it is unlikely that he could be exploited by coercive or non-coercive means by the government of Bulgaria in a way that could force 
Applicant to choose between loyalty to his family in Bulgaria and his loyalty to the United States.  Should any such attempt be made  Applicant testified 
credibly he would contact the appropriate officials.   Thus, any risk of either coercive or non-coercive foreign duress or influence on Applicant and/or his 
immediate family would appear to be slight and clearly manageable.  Contacts with citizens of other countries are relevant to security determinations only if 
they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure through threats against those foreign relatives.  In reaching my conclusion, I 
have considered the totality of those ties and contacts, not just each one in isolation as the Appeal Board has mandated in the Appeal Board Decision and 
Reversal Order in ISCR Case No. 02-22461 (October 27, 2005) at 6.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I conclude Applicant's family ties are not of such a nature as to create any 
tangible risks of undue pressure on Applicant.  Thus, foreign influence security concerns are mitigated under a whole person analysis.  Thus, I resolve SOR 
paragraph 2 and subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.n. in Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the Government raised security concerns over Applicant's Personal Conduct over his omissions on his SF 86, Applicant's explanations for his omissions 
are credible and establish that he had no intent to falsify his form.  Further, when he understood the questions, he made complete disclosures to the DSS agent.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even if one were to view these omissions as falling within,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Disqualifying Condition 2<A HREF="03-18233.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, I conclude that Applicant met the meet the mitigation<A HREF="03-18233.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> guidelines under 
E2.A5.1.3.2.  The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily.  Applicant 
provided all of the information in the interview once he understood what was requested.  Also, looking at Applicant as a whole person<A HREF="03-18233.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> and considering the 
circumstances surrounding his conduct (E2.2.1.2), I conclude Applicant provided a rational basis for his conduct and has refuted Personal Conduct security 
concerns.  Thus, after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant under SOR Paragraph 3 under 
subparagraphs 3.a. through 3.c.</SPAN></P>

to cases involving an applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport.  The Guideline specifically provides that "possession and/or use of a foreign passport" may be a 
disqualifying condition.  It contains no mitigating factor related to the applicant's personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign 
country.  The only applicable mitigation factor addresses the official approval of the United States Government for the possession or use. ****  Therefore, consistent

the appropriate agency of the United State Government."
