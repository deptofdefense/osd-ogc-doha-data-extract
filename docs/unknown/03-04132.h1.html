<P>Applicant was born, raised, and for the most part educated in the People's Republic of China.  He emigrated from the PRC to the U.S. in 1992.  In 1997, he 
married a woman from the PRC.  Applicant's parents, oldest brother, and parents-in-law are citizen residents of the PRC.  Applicant failed to mitigate the 
foreign influence security concerns.  He did mitigate the foreign preference security concern by surrendering his passport to appropriate PRC authorities.  
Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 25 September 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="03-04132.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C (Foreign 
Preference) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 15 October 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The 
case was assigned to me on 22 December 2003.  On 17 February 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 24 February 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULING ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Prior to the hearing, Applicant moved for me to recuse myself from the case because he believed he could not "get a fair and impartial hearing."  App. Ex. I at 
1.  "With Judge Young's expressed opinion of the PRC (the People's Republic of China), there is no way that applicant can get a full, fair, and impartial 
hearing on the merits of his security clearance regardless what other factors exist."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 1-2.  I denied the motion pre-hearing, but permitted Applicant to raise 
the issue at the hearing.</P> 
 
<P>At the hearing, Applicant again raised the issue.  Applicant asserted the nature of the PRC was a critical issue in his case and my adverse finding on this issue in 
another case-ISCR  Case No. 02-22807 at 6 (Young, A.J. Jul. 7, 2003)-would inevitably lead to an adverse decision in Applicant's case.  In ISCR Case No. 02-22807, DOHA declined to grant the applicant a clearance asserting a security risk could exist due to members of her immediate family who were citizens and 
residents of the PRC.  Applicant sought mitigation of this disqualifying condition by showing the immediate family members and associates were not agents of 
a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power.  Mitigating Condition E2.A2.1.3.1.  This is a two-part test.  The second part requires the 
applicant to demonstrate, and the administrative judge to determine, the foreign connections do not place the applicant in a position of vulnerability to be 
influenced by coercive or noncoercive means.  ISCR Case No. 00-0628 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2003).</P> 
 
<P>Whether an applicant's foreign associates are in a position to be exploited by a foreign power is, in large measure, a function of the country in which the foreign 
associates are located.  Thus, it is incumbent upon the administrative judge to make findings as to the nature of the particular country involved.  Countries such 
as Canada, Great Britain, and Italy, for example, are representative democracies that pride themselves on the protection of civil liberties.  An applicant's foreign 
associates in those countries would face considerably less risk of exploitation than those in the PRC, which is known as a repressive regime in which individual 
rights of citizens are not honored.  In ISCR Case No. 02-22807, I made the following statement regarding the PRC:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The PRC is hostile, and has interests inimical, to those of the U.S.  The PRC is a totalitarian state that depends on the suppression of its people.  The treatment 
Applicant's grandfather received during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and her mother received after graduating from medical school are examples of 
how this suppression affected Applicant.  The PRC has been involved in espionage against the U.S., both military and economic.  While Applicant's contacts in 
the PRC are not foreign agents, their presence in that country, subject to the pressures of the communist regime, places Applicant in a position of vulnerability 
that could force her to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and loyalty to the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>"Due process entitles an individual in an administrative proceeding to a fair hearing before an impartial tribunal."  <EM>Roach v. Nat'l Transp. Safety Bd.</EM>, 804 F.2d 
1147, 1160 (10<SUP>th</SUP> Cir. 1986).  <EM>See Goldberg v. Kelly</EM>, 397 U.S. 254, 271 (1970).  There is a presumption the administrative judge is impartial and it is for the 
applicant to demonstrate the contrary.  <EM>See Roberts v. Morton</EM>, 549 F.2d 158, 164 (10<SUP>th</SUP> Cir. 1976).  </P> 
 
<P>Making a determination that the PRC is hostile to the U.S. and has interests inimical to those of the U.S. does not necessarily make the judge who made that 
determination "biased or prejudiced."  </P> 
 
<P>The words [bias and prejudice],connote a favorable or unfavorable disposition or opinion that is somehow wrongful or inappropriate, either because it is 
undeserved, or because it rests upon knowledge that the subject ought not to possess (for example, a criminal juror who has been biased or prejudiced by receipt 
of inadmissible evidence concerning the defendant's prior criminal activities), or because it is excessive in degree (for example, a criminal juror who is so 
inflamed by properly admitted evidence of a defendant's prior criminal activities that he will vote guilty regardless of the facts).</P> 
 
<P><EM></EM><EM>Liteky v. United States</EM>, 510 U.S. 540, 550 (1994).  A judge is not recusable for bias or prejudice when "his knowledge and the opinion it produced were 
properly and necessarily acquired in the course of the proceedings."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 551.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant failed to make the required showing of impartiality, bias, or prejudice.  I never heard of Applicant until I was assigned his case, and I have no 
personal bias against him or  other applicants who have foreign connections with the PRC.  My decision, in the previous case, that the PRC is hostile to the U.S. 
and has interests inimical to those of the U.S., was based on the evidence presented in that case.  My decision was not "wrongful or inappropriate."  It in no way 
signals a decision to deny security clearances to all applicants with foreign connections to the PRC.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-12208 at 5 (Young, A.J., Jul. 30, 
2003) (granting clearance in foreign influence case to an applicant with associates in the PRC, despite finding the PRC was hostile to the U.S.). </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B-Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's wife (&para; 1.a.) and brother &para; 1.d.) are citizens of the PRC residing in the U.S.; Applicant's parents  (&para; 1.b.) and parents-in-law (&para;1.e.) are citizens and residents of the PRC; and Applicant has traveled to the PRC at least six times since 1997 to visit relatives (&para; 1.f.).  A security risk 
may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other person to whom he  may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. 
or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  
Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the SOR allegations alleged under the foreign influence guideline.  
Applicant has immediate family members-his parents and older brother-who are resident citizens of the PRC.  DC E2.A2.1.2.1.  His wife and another brother 
are citizens of the PRC, but residents of the U.S.  <EM>Id.</EM>  In addition, other persons to whom he has close ties of affection or obligation are resident citizens of the 
PRC-his wife's parents and siblings.<A HREF="03-04132.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  <EM>Id.</EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant claims he is entitled to the benefit of two mitigating conditions: (1) that his immediate family members and foreign associates are not agents of a 
foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force him to choose between loyalty to the family member or associate and 
loyalty to the U.S. (MC E2.A2.1.3.1.); and (2) that his contacts with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent (MC E2.A2.1.3.3.).  Applicant established to my 
satisfaction that his foreign family members and associates were not agents of a foreign power.  However, the inquiry in a foreign influence case is not limited 
to consideration of whether the foreign contacts or connections are agents of a foreign power.  He still must demonstrate that his family members and associates 
are not in a position of vulnerability, even if there is no evidence that a foreign country has sought to exploit that vulnerability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 00-0628 at 5 
(App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2003).  Any assessment of an individual's risk of vulnerability to coercion must consider the country in which the individual resides. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although there has been increased cooperation between the U.S. and the PRC since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the PRC is still a totalitarian 
state with a human rights record of abuses that "have been among the most visible and constant points of contention in Sino-U.S. relations since the 1989 
Tiananmen Square crackdown."  Ex. 6 at 7.  The PRC remains one of the most active collectors of U.S. defense information and technology.  Ex. 9.  While 
Applicant's contacts in the PRC are not foreign agents, their presence in that country, subject to the pressures of the communist regime, places them in a 
position to be potentially exploited by the PRC in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to his family and associates and loyalty to the U.S.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's contacts with his family and associates in the PRC cannot be characterized as either infrequent or casual.  He has made eight trips to the PRC in the 
last seven years.  He helped pay for his father's surgery.  He has visited his ill father and expects to return to the PRC when his father dies.  He has petitioned 
the U.S. to permit his older brother to immigrate to the U.S. and is awaiting approval of that application.  Until Applicant's security clearance became an issue, 
his wife contacted her family in the PRC weekly.  While I find nothing unusual or improper in an applicant visiting and staying in close contact with his family 
and his wife's family, or sponsoring members of the family into the U.S., it is evidence of the depth of their familial ties.  Applicant failed to demonstrate that 
his foreign contacts do not place him in a position of vulnerability to coercion or influence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife and other brother are permanent U.S. resident aliens and will apply for U.S. citizenship as soon as they are eligible.  They represent a security 
threat only because of their foreign associates and the ability to pressure Applicant on behalf of those associates.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his wife appear to be people of character.  The evidence supports a belief that they are a welcome additions to the U.S.  Applicant understands his 
duty to report to the authorities any threats or attempts at coercion.  He insists he is willing to bear arms for the U.S., even against the PRC.  Tr. 219-221.  
Applicant is a hard-working man who has clearly embraced the American way of life.  Nevertheless, I am unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant him a security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny Applicant a security clearance is not based on a conclusion that Applicant has done anything 
wrong or is not a loyal U.S. citizen.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  The decision is merely an indication that because of his close familial ties to citizens and 
residents of the PRC, he is in a position of vulnerability to foreign influence.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline C-Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant possessed a current PRC passport.  &para; 2.a. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> When an applicant acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign 
country over the U.S., then he may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the U.S.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established that Applicant possessed a PRC passport after he became a U.S. citizen.  The possession or use of a foreign passport is a 
disqualifying condition.  DC E2.A3.1.2.2.  However, Applicant amply demonstrated that he possessed the passport only as an incidence of his birth in the PRC.  
He did not use his PRC passport after he became a U.S. citizen, the passport has expired, it was canceled by the PRC government, and was surrendered to the 
PRC Embassy.  MC E2.A3.1.3.1.  After carefully reviewing all the evidence, and considering the Government's concession on the foreign passport issue, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the foreign preference security concern.</SPAN></P>
