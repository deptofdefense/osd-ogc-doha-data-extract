<P><STRONG>SYNOPSIS</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant owes approximately $35,928 to the Internal Revenue Service for tax years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2001.  He has paid off a state tax lien 
and three other delinquent accounts.  Although he has retained an accountant to assist with resolving his federal tax problems, security concerns about his 
financial situation remain since the tax debt remains outstanding.  Clearance is denied.   <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>On June 29, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges 
security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn, written statement, dated July 24, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have his case decided on the written record, in 
lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's file of relevant material (FORM) on February 23, 2006. The FORM was mailed to Applicant 
on February 24, 2006, and received on March 1, 2006. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, 
or mitigation. He submitted a response on March 30, 2006. The case was assigned to me on April 20, 2006. <BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant admits to the factual allegations pertaining financial considerations under Guideline F, subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d.  Those admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact.  He denies subparagraphs 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g.  He denies all the allegations under Guideline E and Guideline J.  After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 55-year-old security guard employed by a defense contractor seeking to maintain a security clearance.  He has held a security clearance since 
January 1997.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant  currently owes the Internal Revenue Service for tax years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2001.  The approximate total amount of outstanding 
federal income taxes is $35,928.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> On October 29, 2004, he hired an accountant to assist him in resolving his income tax situation.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> There is no indication that 
any tax payments were made towards his tax debt.  On March 28, 2006, he hired another accountant to resolve his tax situation.  The accountant indicated that 
while he is confident the matter will be resolved, he cannot estimate when the matter will be resolved.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  An IRS Form 2848, Power of Attorney and 
Declaration of Representative, dated March 28, 2006, indicates the new accountant is going to be working on federal income tax issues for tax years 1995, 
1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>     <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>In April 2002, a $7,949 lien was filed against the Applicant in April 2002 for delinquent state income taxes.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A><STRONG> </STRONG> His wages were garnished for taxes owed.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A><STRONG> </STRONG>The 
state tax lien was paid off on January 17, 2006.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A><STRONG> </STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>On January 17, 2003, Applicant submitted a security clearance application.  He answered "No" in response to question "36. Your Financial Record - Tax Lien. 
In the last 7 years, have you had a lien placed against your property for failing to pay taxes or other debts?"<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>A credit report, dated May 23, 2005, revealed a state tax lien for $7,949 which was filed in April 2002 (SOR subparagraph 1.d) and three delinquent accounts. 
The three delinquent accounts included a $261.00 charged off credit card account (SOR subparagraph 1.e); a $1,221 charged off cell phone account (SOR 
subparagraph 1.f); and a judgment for $822 (SOR subparagraph 1.g).<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  In his response to the SOR, Applicant provided proof that all three of the delinquent 
accounts  were paid.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A><STRONG> </STRONG> Applicant denies that he intentionally omitted the state tax lien on his security clearance application.  He indicates he answered the 
questions on his security clearance application to the best of his knowledge and belief.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>It is alleged that Applicant intentionally did not file his federal income tax returns for tax years 1995, 1996, 2000, and 2002. Applicant claims his income tax 
returns have been filed.  He has submitted copies of his federal income tax returns for tax years 1995, 2000,<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> and 2002.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  On May 3, 1999, the IRS notified 
him that they changed his 1996 account to correct his filing status as married based on information Applicant provided so it appears he filed his 1996 tax return.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> 
(16)</SUP></A>  <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant denies falsifying material facts when he claimed that he filed his federal tax returns for 2000 and 2002 in a signed, sworn, statement provided on 
arch 27, 2003.  His 2000 tax returns were prepared on December 4, 2001.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  There is no evidence in the record that provides a basis for the government to 
allege that this return was not filed. In his response to the SOR, Applicant indicates he did not intend to mislead and may have meant to say this his taxes were 
up to date until tax year 2002.  His 2002 taxes were not due until April 15, 2003.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  His tax preparer did not prepare his 2002 federal income tax return until 
October 28, 2005.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>   <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P> A personal financial statement dated March 29, 2002, indicates Applicant and his wife have a total net monthly income of $4,842.  Their total monthly 
expenses are $3,788. They have a net remainder of $964 left over each month.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> <STRONG>  </STRONG><BR>

<P>To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth

of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for

access to classified information.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by 
the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A>  Any 
doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for 
issuing a clearance.<BR>

<P><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline F- Financial Considerations</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guideline F, the government has established its case.  Applicant has had difficulty paying his federal and state income taxes since 1995.  He has 
also incurred a few delinquent debts.  He appears to be unable or unwilling to resolve his income tax delinquencies. He owes the IRS for income taxes owed in 
tax years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2001.  The total approximate amount of outstanding taxes is over $35,000. As such, Financial Considerations 
Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1: (A history of not meeting financial obligations); and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3: (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts) are raised in Applicant's case. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Although Applicant has satisfied the delinquent debts in subparagraphs 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g of the SOR, his federal income tax debt remains outstanding.  He hired 
an accountant in 2001 to assist him with resolving these debts.  In March 2006, he hired another accountant. However, it does not appear that his tax problems 
will be resolved in the near future.</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P>Several conditions could mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant's financial delinquencies.  Neither Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions 
(FC  MC) E2.A6.1.3.1: (The behavior was not recent); or FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2: (It was an isolated incident) apply.  Since his tax debt remains outstanding his 
debts are recent. His failure to pay his income taxes is not an isolated incident since his tax debt has accumulated over six tax years.  <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>  Based on Applicant's adjusted gross income, it does not appear that Applicant's financial situation was the result of circumstances that were beyond his 
control.  As such FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3: (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a 
business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)), does not apply.  His problems appear to be more due to a lack or 
organization and focus when pertaining to his income taxes.  He has the ability to pay the taxes.  <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4: (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control) does not apply since there is no indication Applicant sought financial counseling.  Although he has hired two accountants  to assist him in 
resolving his federal income tax debt, his significant tax delinquency remains.</P> 
 
<P>His federal tax problems will not be resolved or under control in the near future.</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P>Although Applicant has resolved some of his delinquent debt, I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6: (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts) due to the outstanding balance on his federal tax debt.  Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern under 
Guideline F.    <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The government alleged Applicant deliberately falsified his answer on his security clearance application with respect to question 36 (SOR subparagraph 3.a).  I 
find for the Applicant with respect to this allegation.  I find that he did not intentionally falsify his security clearance application. He appears to be very 
unorganized when it comes to his income taxes.  I conclude he left the tax lien off due to oversight rather than any intent to mislead.  He did list other financial 
issues on his security clearance application.  Considering this, it is unlikely that he intended to hide his financial problems from the government.  <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>I also find that Applicant did not intend to falsify material facts in a March 27, 2003, signed sworn statement provided to the Defense Security Service by 
stating that he had filed his federal tax returns for 2000 and 2002. He had filed his 2000 taxes. He had not filed his 2002 income taxes.  However, his 2002 
income taxes were not due until April 15, 2003.  I  find for the Applicant with respect to Guideline E.<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The government established a prima facie case with respect to the criminal conduct concern.  Title 26 United States Code &sect; 7203 states:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, 
keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, keep such records or supply such information, at the time or 
times required by law or regulations, shall in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be 
fined not more than $25,000, or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.<A HREF="04-10339.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant violated Title 26 United States Code &sect; 26 by willfully failing to file his tax returns on time and by failing to pay taxes owed for tax years 1995, 1996, 
2000 and 2002.  Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1: (Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the 
person was formally charged) and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2: (A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) apply.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The criminal conduct concern can be mitigated.  I find that no mitigating conditions apply to Applicant's case.  Although he eventually filed his income tax 
returns, he still owes taxes for tax years 1995, 1996, 2000 and 2002.  He remains in violation of Title 26 United States Code &sect; 26.  Although he hired an 
accountant in 2004 to resolve his tax issues.  He provided no information to indicate what actions were taken towards resolving his income tax situation.  He 
hired another accountant on March 28, 2006, but has provided insufficient information to mitigate the criminal conduct concern since it appears the tax debt 
remains outstanding.   <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>I find for the Applicant with respect to SOR subparagraph 2.e.  He did not violate Title 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 since he did not intentionally falsify his security 
clearance application or his March 27, 2003, signed, sworn statement. However, his willful failure to pay his federal income taxes remains a security concern 
under Guideline J.  I find against Applicant under the criminal conduct concern.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>I considered all the evidence provided and also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national 
interests. I find Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern raised by the financial considerations concern since he has neglected to pay his federal 
income taxes since 1995 and has not resolved his tax debt.  Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case that it is not clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. <BR>
