<P>Applicant's excessive alcohol abuse which was used to medicate his depression, resulted in a DUI in October 2002, followed by alcohol rehabilitation treatment 
and a relapse in December 2003, has not been mitigated by sufficient evidence of reform and rehabilitation.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On August 3, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued the attached Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on August 9, 2004, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to 
the undersigned on November 1, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on November 10, 2004, scheduling the hearing for November 22, 2004.  The hearing 
was rescheduled for December 6, 2004.  At the hearing the Government presented eight exhibits.  The Applicant called three witnesses and presented seven 
exhibits.  He also testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on December 20, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 57 years old.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Application Engineer, and he seeks a security clearance in connection with his 
employment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the attached Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant got married in 1964 at the young age of eighteen.  He and his wife had a daughter in 1965.  He and his wife divorced in 1967.  He obtained sole 
custody of his daughter, whom he and his mother have raised.  Following his divorce, the Applicant fell into a state of depression.  He did not seek psychiatric 
care until sometime in the 1989 or 1990.  At that time, the Applicant was prescribed medication for his condition and was diagnosed with depression.  As time 
went on, however, his depression grew progressively worse.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In June 1994, the Applicant got remarried.  Due to his increased feelings of depression and the fact that he was not responsive to his medication, the Applicant 
began to self-medicate by consuming increased amounts of alcohol.  He and his wife were also experiencing severe marital problems.  The Applicant testified 
that he was consuming about three or four drinks of hard liquor everyday after work.  In August 2002, his depression had gotten so bad he admitted himself into 
a hospital for mental heath treatment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 8, 2002, the Applicant was arrested for (1) Driving with .08% or more Alcohol in blood and (2) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.  The 
Applicant does not remember the particulars of the accident only that he had been consuming alcohol before driving.  Referring to the police report of the 
incident the Applicant was driving erratically and had a high speed rollover car accident.  He was unrestrained at the time, and sustained serious injuries to his 
head.  The Applicant testified that as a result of the accident he now suffers some permanent brain damage.  The Applicant stated that he has blank spots in his 
memory as to how the accident occurred.  He does know that he was in a coma for about a week after the accident.  The day after the accident, on October 9, 
2002, the Applicant was diagnosed in part with Alcohol Withdrawal, Delirium Tremen.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 6).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant eventually pled nolo contendre to Count (1) and was sentenced to two days in custody.  He was placed on five years probation, ordered to 
participate in an Alcohol Education Program for three months or longer, to attend a First Offender DUI program School and was fined $1,871.00.  His driver's 
license was restricted for 90 days.  Count (2) was dismissed.  The Applicant remains on probation for this offense until 2008.  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibit 2).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant stated that he realized that he had a drinking problem and requested that he be treated for both his depression and for alcohol abuse.  The hospital 
psychiatrist recommended alcohol rehabilitation.  The Applicant received treatment for alcohol dependence from October 22, 2002 through November 1, 2002.  
He was evaluated on November 7, 2002 by the hospital's Addictive Medicine department and he also received treatment from November 2, 2002 to at least 
arch 2003.  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6 and 7).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant stated that after his accident, he completely abstained from using alcohol until his mother, who had been suffering for a long time from a chronic 
illness, died in December 2003.  The Applicant explained that he consumed one mixed drink at that time.  He has not consumed any alcohol since December 
2003, and has no intentions of ever consuming it again.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since December 2003, the Applicant has been attending Alcoholic Anonymous meetings on a regular basis and he has an AA sponsor.  He has also received 
counseling from his church.  He has a new wife who does not tolerate any drinking or illegal drug use.  The Applicant believes that he now has the support 
mechanisms in place to help him remain sober.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several individuals testified on behalf of the Applicant.  An engineer, who has worked with the Applicant, his pastor, and his new wife all attest to the 
Applicant's great strides in  maintaining  a sober life style.  They consider him to be reliable, honest and trustworthy.  He is also patriotic and loyal to the United 
States.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several letters of recommendation submitted on behalf of the Applicant collectively attest to the fact that the Applicant has stopped consuming alcohol and that 
he is highly motivated to stay sober in the future.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibits D and E).    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's laboratory results of August 2004, do not indicate any alcohol use or active liver disease.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibit A).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A letter from the Applicant's psychiatrist states that the Applicant is receiving psychiatric care for the treatment of Major Depression and that the Applicant has 
been compliant with all treatment recommendations and his symptoms are adequately controlled with medications.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibit F).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A performance evaluation of the Applicant dated May 16, 2003, indicates that the Applicant is a "successful contributor" at his place of employment.  (<EM>See</EM> 
Applicant's Exhibit G).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Alcohol Consumption</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence . . . .</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgement.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">5.  Consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed medical professional and following completion of an alcohol 
rehabilitation program.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  the alcohol related incidents do not indicate a pattern;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination."  The Administrative Judge can draw only 
those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in repeated instances of alcohol abuse which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has abused alcohol (Guideline G).  This evidence 
indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, and a failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance 
holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.  If an Applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in his private 
affairs, there then exists the possibility that he or she may demonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon careful review of the record, since the Applicant's accident in October 2002, he has worked hard to establish the necessary mechanism in which to 
maintain sobriety.  It also appears that he is serious about this commitment.  He has completed a treatment program for alcoholism, he has been regularly 
attending AA meetings, he is working the twelve steps of AA, and he has an AA  sponsor.  He is also very involved in his church.  He has been completely 
sober for about thirteen months.  Under ordinary circumstances, without the diagnosis of Major Depression, I would be convinced that the Applicant would not 
return to his old ways and self medicate with the use of alcohol.  However, in this case, the Applicant suffers from Major Depression that has not been 
controlled for any sustained period without the Applicant's use of alcohol.  I am not convinced that the Applicant will not return to self medication when 
confronted with the ordinary stresses of life, much less the extraordinary ones which will inevitably occur.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">More time is needed in rehabilitation to determine 
that the Applicant will not return to his old ways of alcohol abuse. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's excessive use of alcohol in 2002 to medicate his depression resulted in an arrest and conviction for DUI, and a car accident that almost killed 
him.  He remains on probation for this offense until 2008.  The Applicant has also suffered some permanent brain damage as a result of his abusive drinking.  In 
2002, he was diagnosed by credentialed medical authority with alcohol abuse, he sought treatment for alcohol abuse, and he has tried to remain sober.  In 
September 2003, just thirteen months ago, with the stress of his mother's death, he relapsed.  He quickly returned to the sober lifestyle that he is trying to 
maintain.  However, given the recency and extent of his alcohol abuse, I cannot find that he is not sufficiently trustworthy to handle classified information at 
this time.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Disqualifying conditions<EM> (1)  alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence . . . .(4) habitual or binge consumption 
of alcohol to the point of impaired judgement;</EM> and <EM>(5) Consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed medical professional 
and following completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program </EM>apply.  Mitigating conditions that are applicable but are outweighed by the facts of this 
particular case <EM>(1) the alcohol related incidents do not indicate a pattern, </EM>and<EM> (3) positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</EM>.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the totality of 
the evidence, I find that the Applicant's alcohol consumption establishes doubt about his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  The Applicant is 
commended for his desire to stay sober and the changes he had made in his life to do so.  However, more time is needed in rehabilitation to determine that the 
Applicant will not return to his old ways of alcohol abuse.  Accordingly, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) are found against the Applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of 
Reasons.</SPAN></P>
