<P>Applicant has a history of alcohol-related incidents.  Although he appears to have solved his problem with alcohol, he deliberately omitted from his security

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 26 June 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-11286.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in a writing notarized on 11 August 2003 and elected to have his case decided on the record 
without a hearing.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections 
and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the SOR.  Applicant received the FORM on 23 October 2003 and submitted a response dated 19 November 
2003.  The case was assigned to me on 22 December 2003. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 41-year-old senior system engineer for a defense contractor.  Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from 17 July 1980 until 11 August 
2000, achieving the rank of petty officer first class (E-6).  </P> 
 
<P>On 2 April 1986, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence (DUI).  He seemed very confused, apparently failed to understand the 
directions of the police officer concerning field sobriety tests, and resisted the officer when he tried to arrest him.  Item 11 at 3-4.  Applicant was convicted, 
placed on probation, ordered to perform community service, and fined.  Item 12 at 4.  Applicant's license was suspended indefinitely because he failed to attend 
driver improvement school as required by the court.  <EM>Id. </EM>at 2.  Applicant's probation was extended because he failed to complete his sentence to community 
service within the allotted time period.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 3.  </P> 
 
<P>On 9 October 1992, Applicant was punished under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. &sect; 815, for assault and being drunk and 
disorderly.  The punishment consisted of reduction in rank for E-6 to E-5, restriction for 60 days, and forfeiture of pay.  Item 8 at 1; Item 10 at 1.  The 
punishment was later mitigated to forfeiture of pay.  Item 10 at 2.  On 9 April 1994, Applicant was apprehended and charged with drunken driving.  </P> 
 
<P>On 13 May 1994, Applicant was punished under Article 15, UCMJ, for operating a vehicle while impaired by alcohol.  The punishment consisted of restriction 
to base for 30 days (suspended for six months) and forfeiture of pay.  Ex. 14.</P> 
 
<P>On 12 May 2000, on the way home from his retirement party, Applicant was leaving the parking lot when his vehicle scraped another.  When the police arrived, 
he was arrested and charged with DUI alcohol (DUIA), hit and run, driving without a valid license, and falsely identifying himself to a peace officer.  Item 13.  
He was convicted of the DUIA and sentenced to 180 days in jail, suspended, and was fined.  The other charges were dismissed.  From May 2000 until June 
2000, Applicant voluntarily attended an outpatient alcohol treatment program. </P> 
 
<P>Since leaving the Navy, Applicant has had no incidents with alcohol.  His performance report from his employer shows that he exceeds expectations, and he 
was recommended for the company's presidential award.  </P> 
 
<P>On 21 August 2001, Applicant executed a security clearance application (SCA) in which he certified that his statements were "true, complete, and correct to the 
best of his knowledge and belief."  Question 24 asked if he had ever been charged or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs.  Applicant answered 
"yes," but listed only his 2000 conviction.  Item 4 at 6.  Question 24 asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had been subject to court-martial or other 
disciplinary actions under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to include nonjudicial punishment.  <EM>Id.</EM>   Applicant answered "no.".  </P> 
 
<P>On 13 February 2003, Applicant answered DOHA's interrogatories concerning his use of alcohol.  Item 5.  Question 5 asked if Applicant had been arrested, 
charged, or held by law enforcement authorities for any reason.  If the answer was yes, Applicant was to "provide date(s), reason(s) or charge(s) and disposition 
or penalty imposed for each offense."  Applicant answered "yes" and listed only the 2000 DUIA arrest and conviction.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G-Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was charged  with DUIA, hit and run, driving without a driver's license, and falsely impersonating a police officer in 
2000 (&para; 1.a.); charged with and convicted of drunk driving on a military installation in 1994 (&para; 1.b.); convicted of drunk and disorderly in 1992 (&para; 1.c.), charged 
with and convicted of driving under the influence in 1986 (&para; 1.d.); and attended an alcohol treatment program in 2000 (&para; 1.e.).  Excessive alcohol consumption 
often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information due to carelessness.  Directive &para; E2.A7.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations in the SOR &para; 1.<A HREF="02-11286.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Applicant's alcohol-related incidents 
away from work raise a security concern that may disqualify him from obtaining a security clearance.  DC E2.A7.1.2.1.  Applicant's latest alcohol-related 
incident was almost four years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem.  MC E2.A7.1.3.2.  Although it took almost 20 years, Applicant now appears 
to understand that he has a drinking problem.  After the 2000 incident, he sought counseling on his own.  He left the counseling because of his separation from 
the Navy and subsequent move out of the area.  However, he has a support network that is helping him cope.  Applicant has made positive changes in his 
behavior supportive of sobriety.  MC E2.A7.1.3.3.  After considering the totality of the circumstances of this case, I am persuaded Applicant's alcohol problem 
is under control and does pose a risk to national security.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant deliberately falsified his SCA by listing only one of his alcohol-related incidents in answering question 24 (&para; 2.a.) and by 
answering no to question 25 concerning whether he had been the subject of a court-martial or other disciplinary proceedings under the UCMJ in the previous 
seven years (&para; 2.c.); and he deliberately falsified interrogatories by listing only one of his alcohol-related offenses (&para; 2.b.).  Conduct involving questionable 
judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the applicant 
may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that Applicant failed to provide "true, complete, and correct" answers to 
question 24 on his SCA and to the alcohol interrogatories.  The deliberate omission or falsification of relevant and material facts from an SCA raises a security 
concern that may disqualify Applicant from holding a security clearance.  DC E2.A5.1.2.2.  Applicant asserts he did not provide information on his other 
alcohol-related offenses because he was unsure of the dates and did not want "unconfirmed information to be provided and then changed several times."  Yet, 
Applicant never provided information revealing that he had been charged with alcohol-related offenses at other times and offer to find out what the dates were.  
He omitted the information from three documents spanning approximately 18 months -the SCA in August 2001, his statement to a Defense Security Service 
agent in January 2002, and his alcohol interrogatories in  February 2003.  I am convinced Applicant deliberately omitted information about his use of alcohol 
from these documents that were relevant and material to a determination of his security worthiness.  None of the mitigating conditions under Guideline E, apply 
to Applicant's case.  I find against Applicant on &para;&para; 2.a. and 2.b.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government did not establish Applicant's answer to question 25 was not "true, complete, and correct."  Question 25 asked Applicant for his military 
disciplinary record for the previous seven years.  The nonjudicial punishment Applicant received in April 1994 was more than seven years before he completed 
the SCA on 21 August 2001.  I find for Applicant on &para; 2.c.</SPAN></P>
