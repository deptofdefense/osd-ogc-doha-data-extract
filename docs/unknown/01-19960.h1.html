<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is not and was not a dual citizen; and as such, he never held a valid foreign passport while a U.S. citizen.  His family and friends, who are foreign 
nationals, are not agents of a foreign power, nor are they in a position to be exploited by a foreign power.  Clearance is granted.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 31, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on January 23, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on March 12, 2002.  A notice of hearing was issued on March 27, 2002, and the case was heard on May 1, 2002.  The 
Government submitted documentary evidence, and called one witness to testify.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant.  The transcript was received on May 
9, 2002.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's alleged foreign preference and perceived foreign influence militates against the granting of a 
security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is 33 years of age, has a 
aster's Degree</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline C - Foreign Preference</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  The Applicant was born in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) in 1968, but immigrated to the U.S. with his parents and siblings in 1987 (Transcript (TR) 
at page 22 lines 7~18).  He has lived in the U.S. for the last 15 years (<EM>id</EM>), although the rest of his family has returned to South Korea (TR at page 27 lines 2~4).  
The Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 1997 (TR at page 32 lines 19~21).  When he became a U.S. citizen, he lost his South Korean citizenship (TR at page 32 
lines 22~25, at page 33 lines 10~19, <EM>see also</EM> Applicant's Exhibit (AppX) A).  Although he still held a current South Korean passport, that passport was not 
valid as he was no longer a South Korean citizen (AppX A).  Since becoming a U.S. citizen, he never used the South Korean passport, and has returned it to the 
South Korean Consulate (TR at page 33 lines 1~9, and AppX A).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.~1.c.  As stated earlier, the Applicant parents and siblings have returned to South Korea.  They are all citizens of South Korea.  His mother is a housewife 
and has no connection with the government of South Korea (TR at page 33 line 23 to page 34 line 7).  The Applicant's father is a doctor and has no connection 
with South Korea's government (TR at page 34 lines 8~17).  The Applicant has two sisters, one is a housewife and the other a doctor (TR at page 34 line 18 to 
page 35 line 1).  Neither sister has any connection with the government of South Korea (TR at page 25 lines 2~5).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's grandmother is a citizen of and resides in South Korea (TR at page 35 lines 6~9).  She is 83 years old, helps his mother with housework, and 
has no connection with South Korea's government (TR at page 35 lines 9~11).  His in laws are both citizens of and reside in South Korea (TR at page 35 lines 
22~25).  His mother-in-law is a retired school teacher and has no connection with the government of South Korea (TR at page 36 lines 13~18).  His father-in-law is a high school teacher, and that is the only arguable connection he has with South Korea's government (TR at page 36 lines 1~12).  The Applicant has 
other family members and friends who are citizens of and reside in South Korea.  None have any connection with its government (TR at page 36 lines 19~24).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's spouse, who is a citizen of South Korea, is a permanent resident of the U.S., and is in the final stages of her U.S. citizenship application (TR at 
page 36 line 25 to page 37 line 6).  She has no connection with the government of South Korea (TR at page 37 lines 7~10).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> should be followed in every case </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> are neither automatically determinative </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Preference</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  An immediate family member . . . is a citizen of . . . a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), . . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference), and Guideline B (foreign influence), which establishes doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to 
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates a foreign preference, or who is subject to a foreign influence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are 
harmful to the interests of the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all 
security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was not and is not now a dual citizen.  When he become a U.S. citizen, he lost his South Korean Citizenship.  After becoming a U.S. citizen, he 
did possess a current but invalid South Korean passport.  That passport was never used by the U.S. citizen, and has been returned to the South Korean 
Consulate.  I conclude that he has not only met but has clearly surpassed the requirement of the mitigating condition under Guideline C, which merely requires 
that he "express a willingness to renounce dual citizenship."  He renounced his South Korean citizenship when he became an American; and as such, was never 
a dual citizen.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to what foreign influence his friend and family may have over the Applicant, I can find none.  Except for his father-in-law, who is a high school teacher, they 
have no connection whatsoever with the government of South Korea.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his alleged foreign preference, and foreign influence.  The Applicant 
has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines B and C, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion 
under Guidelines B and C.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">interests of national security to grant or continue a security
