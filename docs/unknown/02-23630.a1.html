  Matters alleged in the SOR that were found in Applicant's favor by the Administrative Judge are moot and need not be discussed or addressed by the Board to resolve Applicant's appeal.  The Judge properly concluded Applicant's 1984 burglary conviction, which resulted in Applicant serving two years in prison, fell under 10  U.S.C. 986 and precluded a favorable security clearance decision.  Board does not recommend this case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. 986(d).   Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated July 16, 2003, which stated the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Wilford H. Ross issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated May 14, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issue has been raised on appeal: whether the Board should recommend Applicant's case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).  For 
the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision and does not recommend Applicant's case be considered further for a waiver under 10 
U.S.C. &sect;986(d).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal 
error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed 
factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why 
party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the 
Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational 
connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect 
of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of 
opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary 
to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state 
or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article 
VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such 
relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The 
Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the 
evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility 
determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal 
cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and 
E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge entered formal findings in favor of Applicant with respect to the matters covered by the SOR paragraphs alleged under Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) and Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  The Judge's findings and conclusions under Guidelines E and F are not at issue on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant's 1984 conviction for burglary -- which resulted in Applicant serving two years in prison -- fell under 10 U.S.C. 
&sect;986 and precluded a favorable security clearance decision, even though Applicant's criminal conduct was mitigated under Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions 1, 2, 
3, 4, and 6.  The Judge rendered an unfavorable security clearance decision, but recommended Applicant's case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. 
&sect;986(d).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal brief contains statements and explanations about the matters alleged in the SOR under Guidelines E and F.  Given the Judge's favorable findings and 
conclusions under those two Guidelines, Applicant's statements and explanations about matters covered by those two Guidelines are moot and need not be addressed by 
the Board.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal brief contains statements and arguments about his background and family, his conduct after the 1984 conviction, his work experience, and a request 
that the Board recommend his case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).</P> 
 
<P>The Deputy Secretary of Defense memorandum implementing the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 states: "The decision as to whether a particular case involves a 
meritorious case that would justify pursuing a request for waiver shall be the province of the DoD Component concerned (i.e. all Components authorized to grant, deny or 
revoke access to classified information) beginning with the Director of the Component Central Adjudication Facility (CAF), the Component appellate authority or other 
appropriate senior Component official."  For purposes of the Deputy Secretary of Defense memorandum, the Director, DOHA is the Director of the Component Central 
Adjudication Facility for industrial security clearance cases.</P> 
 
<P>To implement the Deputy Secretary of Defense memorandum, the Director, DOHA issued an operating instruction (dated July 10, 2001) which states the following:</P> 
 
<P>"Administrative Judges are responsible for initial resolution as to whether or not 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of the case."  (Operating Instruction, paragraph 2.e.)</P> 
 
<P>"In the event of an appeal raising an issue as to the applicability of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board is responsible for final resolution of the issue."  (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 2.f.)</P> 
 
<P>"In the event of a final determination that 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of a case, the Director is solely responsible for the discretionary decision as to whether to 
recommend to the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) that 10 U.S.C. 986 should be waived by the Secretary of Defense."  (Operating Instruction, paragraph 2.g.)</P> 
 
<P>"If an Administrative Judge issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Administrative Judge shall include without 
explanation either the statement 'I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'I do not recommend further consideration of this case 
for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'"  (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.e.)</P> 
 
<P>"If the Appeal Board issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board shall include without explanation either the 
statement 'The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'The Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this 
case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'" (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.f.)</P> 
 
<P>"In any case in which [the] Administrative Judge, or [the] Appeal Board in the event of an appeal, recommends consideration of a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Director 
shall within his sole discretion determine whether or not to forward the case to the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) for further consideration of a possible waiver 
of 10 U.S.C. 986 by the Secretary of Defense together with such rationale as may be requested by the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel)."  (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 3.g.)</P> 
 
<P>The Operating Instruction does not authorize the Board to review an Administrative Judge's recommendation whether or not a waiver should be considered.  
Furthermore, under the Operating Instruction, the Board is not authorized to give reasons or an explanation for its decision to recommend or not recommend that a waiver 
be considered, but only state without explanation either: (1) "The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986" or (2) "The 
Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986."  Since the Board is asked to make a recommendation in its own capacity, 
the Board is not bound by the recommendation made by the Judge below and must review the record evidence as a whole in order to fulfill its obligation to make a 
meaningful decision whether to recommend or not that a waiver should be considered.  Because of the constraints of the Operating Instruction, the Board cannot discuss 
or address the specific arguments and statements made in Applicant's appeal brief.</P> 
 
<P>Recognizing the limits of its authority under the Operating Instruction, the Board has reviewed the record evidence as a whole and states the following: The Appeal Board 
does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge properly concluded that Applicant's case falls under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 because of his 1984 conviction -- which resulted in him serving two years 
in prison.  Because Applicant has not demonstrated error below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's unfavorable security clearance decision.  Finally, the Board 
does not recommend this case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).</P>
