  There is no right to a security clearance, and a decision to grant or continue a security clearance does not give rise to any right or vested interest in keeping it.  A decision to grant or continue a security clearance made before the effective date of 10 U.S.C. 986 does not preclude application of that statute.  The Administrative Judge  properly concluded that 10 U.S.C. 986 precluded a favorable security clearance decision in this case.  Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Board does not  recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. 986(d).  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated June 20, 2003 which stated the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated March 26, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 is applicable to Applicant's case; (2) whether 
the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's history of criminal conduct had not been mitigated under Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 6; and (3) 
whether the Board should recommend that Applicant's case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms 
the Administrative Judge's decision, and does not recommend that Applicant's case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d). </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal 
error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed 
factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why 
party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the 
Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational 
connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect 
of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of 
opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary 
to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state 
or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article 
VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such 
relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The 
Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the 
evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility 
determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal 
cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and 
E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG><A HREF="02-20201.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 is applicable to Applicant's case</SPAN>.  Applicant does not dispute the Administrative Judge's finding 
that in 1991 Applicant pleaded guilty to criminal charges (two counts of robbery in the second degree and one count of criminal possession of stolen property), and was 
sentenced to a minimum of one-and-a-half years and a maximum of four years in jail.  Applicant does challenge the Judge's conclusion that his conviction and sentence of 
imprisonment required application of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.<A HREF="02-20201.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Applicant asserts  that he completed his security clearance application one month before the effective date of 10 
U.S.C. &sect;986, and argues that if his investigation had been conducted more quickly he could have been granted a security clearance before 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 went into 
effect.  For the reasons that follow, Applicant's claim of error lacks merit.</P> 
 
<P>Apart from the fact that Applicant has no legal right to have his security clearance case adjudicated within one month of completing his security clearance application, 
Applicant would not be entitled to avoid the application of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 even if he had been granted a security clearance before that statute went into effect.  There is 
no right to a security clearance,<A HREF="02-20201.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and a decision to grant or continue a security clearance does not give rise to any right or vested interest in  keeping it.<A HREF="02-20201.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Furthermore, a 
decision to grant or continue a security clearance made before the effective date of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 does not preclude application of that statute.<A HREF="02-20201.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Therefore, it was not 
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Administrative Judge to apply 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 to Applicant's case.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's history of criminal conduct had not been mitigated under Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 6</SPAN>.  
The Administrative Judge concluded that there was not sufficient record evidence to warrant application of Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 6.<A HREF="02-20201.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  In challenging the 
Judge's conclusion, Applicant makes various factual assertions that seek to supplement the record evidence.  Such factual assertions constitute new evidence, which the 
Board cannot consider.<A HREF="02-20201.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  What remains of Applicant's challenge to the Judge's conclusion about Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 6 fails to identify any error by 
the Judge.</P> 
 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Board should recommend that Applicant's case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d)</SPAN>.  Making allowances for Applicant's <EM>pro se</EM> 
status, the Board construes Applicant's argument that he should receive a favorable security clearance decision despite his past conviction as raising the issue of whether 
the Board should recommend that his case be considered further for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).</P> 
 
<P>Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d), the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the military department concerned may authorize an exception to the statutory prohibition 
against granting or renewing a security clearance for cases covered by 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(1) or 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(c)(4).</P> 
 
<P>In a June 7, 2001 memorandum implementing the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986, the Deputy Secretary of Defense indicated: "The decision as to whether a particular case 
involves a meritorious case that would justify pursuing a request for waiver shall be the province of the DoD Component concerned (i.e. all Components authorized to 
grant, deny or revoke access to classified information) beginning with the Director of the Component Central Adjudication Facility (CAF), the Component appellate 
authority or other appropriate senior Component official."  For purposes of the June 7, 2001 memorandum, the Director, DOHA is the Director of the Component 
Central Adjudication Facility for industrial security clearance cases.</P> 
 
<P>To implement the June 7, 2001 memorandum, the Director, DOHA issued an operating instruction (dated July 10, 2001) which indicates the following:</P> 
 
<P>"Administrative Judges are responsible for initial resolution as to whether or not 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of the case."  (Operating Instruction, paragraph 2.e.)</P> 
 
<P>"In the event of an appeal raising an issue as to the applicability of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board is responsible for final resolution of the issue."  (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 2.f.)</P> 
 
<P>"In the event of a final determination that 10 U.S.C. 986 applies to the facts of a case, the Director is solely responsible for the discretionary decision as to whether to 
recommend to the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) that 10 U.S.C. 986 should be waived by the Secretary of Defense."  (Operating Instruction, paragraph 2.g.)</P> 
 
<P>"If an Administrative Judge issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Administrative Judge shall include without 
explanation either the statement 'I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'I do not recommend further consideration of this case 
for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'"  (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.e.)</P> 
 
<P>"If the Appeal Board issues a decision denying or revoking a clearance solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Appeal Board shall include without explanation either the 
statement 'The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986' or 'The Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this 
case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.'" (Operating Instruction, paragraph 3.f.)</P> 
 
<P>"In any case in which [the] Administrative Judge, or [the] Appeal Board in the event of an appeal, recommends consideration of a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986, the Director 
shall within his sole discretion determine whether or not to forward the case to the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) for further consideration of a possible waiver 
of 10 U.S.C. 986 by the Secretary of Defense together with such rationale as may be requested by the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel)."  (Operating 
Instruction, paragraph 3.g.)</P> 
 
<P>Having concluded that 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 is applicable to Applicant's case, all that remains for the Board to do is consider Applicant's request that it recommend further 
consideration of his case for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).</P> 
 
<P>The Operating Instruction does not authorize the Board to review an Administrative Judge's recommendation whether or not a waiver should be considered.  
Furthermore, under the Operating Instruction, the Board is not authorized to give reasons or an explanation for its decision to recommend or not recommend that a waiver 
be considered, but only state without explanation either: (1) "The Appeal Board recommends consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986" or (2) "The 
Appeal Board does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986."  Since the Board is asked to make a recommendation in its own capacity, 
the Board is not bound by the recommendation made by the Judge below and must review the record evidence as a whole in order to fulfill its obligation to make a 
meaningful decision whether to recommend or not that a waiver should be considered.</P> 
 
<P>Under the Operating Instruction the Board cannot address the specific arguments asserted in support of Applicant's request that the Board recommend his case be 
considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d).  The Board reaches this conclusion for the following reasons: (1) the Board does not have the authority to review the 
Administrative Judge's recommendation that Applicant's case be considered for a waiver under 10 U.S.C. &sect;986(d); and (2) the Board is precluded from giving an 
explanation for its own recommendation concerning waiver.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusions</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Board affirms the Administrative Judge's conclusion that 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 precluded him from making a favorable security clearance decision in Applicant's case.</P> 
 
<P>Recognizing the limits of its authority under the Operating Instruction, the Board has reviewed the record evidence as a whole and states the following: The Appeal Board 
does not recommend consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986.</P>
