<P>Applicant is a single, 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor, employed as a desktop publisher II.  She had delinquent debts.  She completed a financial 
counseling course, has all but one delinquent debt paid, and has adequate income to pay debts with a sizable surplus each month.  Financial considerations were 
mitigated.  She embezzled money from an employer, made restitution, and completed probation.  She gave a false answer on her security clearance application.

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On January 18, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order 
10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, 
<EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  The SOR alleged reasons 
under Guidelines F (financial considerations), J (criminal conduct), and E (personal conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding 
under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.</P> 
<P>In a written statement dated February 10, 2005, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was previously assigned 
to another administrative judge on July 18, 2005, but was reassigned to me on September 23, 2005, due to caseload considerations. Notice of the hearing was 
issued September 30, 2005, scheduling the hearing for October 27, 2005.  The hearing was held as scheduled.  The transcript (Tr.) was received November 9, 
2005.  The transcript (Tr.) was received November 9, 2005.  At the hearing, the government offered twelve exhibits, Applicant submitted six exhibits, the 
government called one witness, the Applicant called two witnesses, and Applicant testified in her own behalf.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f., 2.b., and part of 3.b.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  
She denied the remaining allegations.  I make the following additional findings of fact:</P>

<P>In July 1993, she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, being discharged in December 1993.<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>On March 3, 1997, her landlord filed a criminal complaint against her for theft of services (failure to transfer utility to her name).<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  She paid these amounts on 
arch 4 and 26, 1997, to the property manager.  She was arrested in May 1997, and at arraignment, the charges were dismissed as restitution was paid.<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  She 
denied the SOR allegation in subparagraph 2.a. because the case was dismissed.  She had no knowledge that the landlord had filed a complaint, and the landlord 
did not know she had paid the property manager.  Therefore, there was doubt in her mind that a crime had been committed.<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>She was employed by an accounting firm from October 1999 until November 2000, when she was laid off.  She drew unemployment for three weeks until re-employed.  She bought office equipment from her employer, which she paid off in 2005.<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>From May through September 2002, she worked a second job as a bookkeeper for a real estate title company.<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  While working there, she was in another vehicle 
accident. She was off work a month.<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  She embezzled $7,281.00 while employed there.<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  Subsequent to her discharge, she made restitution arrangements with 
her former employer.<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  In February 2003, final restitution was made from proceeds of the insurance settlement from her 2002 accident.<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  Although given 
assurances by her former employer that no criminal charges would be filed if she made restitution, she was arrested in May 2003, and charged with nine felony 
counts.  She pled guilty to a reduced misdemeanor count, paid fines and costs of $520.50, ordered to serve 180 days in jail which was suspended, she was given 
credit for six days in jail, and placed on two years unsupervised probation.<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  She successfully completed probation on July 29, 2005.<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>From March 28, 2003, until July 1, 2004, she successfully completed a budget, credit, and home ownership education program with Resources Education 
Assistance for Community Housing  (REACH), a non-profit organization to assist individuals in becoming financially self-sufficient.<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In response to Standard Form 86 (SF 86), dated February 21, 2002, <STRONG>QUESTION 20. YOUR EMPLOYMENT RECORD "</STRONG>Has any of the following happened 
to you <STRONG>in the last 10 years?  </STRONG>If <STRONG>'Yes,' </STRONG>begin with the most recent occurrence and go backward, providing the date fired, quit, or left, and other information 
requested.  Use the following codes and explain the reason your employment was ended: 1 - Fired from a job  2 - Quit a job after being told you'd be fired  3 - 
Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct  4 - Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance  5 - 
Left a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances," she answered "No."<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  She was terminated for tardiness, inability and unwillingness to work 
according to instructions, and personal use of company time and assets.<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>A personal financial statement prepared by Applicant in October 2005, showed sufficient income to pay outstanding debts, with about 60% of her net income 
left for living expenses.<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></P>

<P>"[No] one has a 'right' to a security clearance."<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information."<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  The 
President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates 
loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting 
allegiances and potential coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing use, handling, and protection of classified information."<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  
Eligibility for a security clearance may be adjudicated using the  security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the 
applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or 
presence of rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  </P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven 
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has 
access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a 
compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as 
his or his own.  The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for 
access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="03-20014.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A>  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, not 
actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial 
security decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security 
clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence as a whole,  I find the following guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F: <EM>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked 
to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts</EM>; </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J: <EM>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment,</EM> <EM>reliability and trustworthiness</EM>; and </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E: <EM>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information</EM>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><STRONG>Financial Considerations.  </STRONG>The government has established its case under Guideline F. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 
E2.A6.1.2.1. arises where there is <EM>(A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>.)  Similarly, FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. applies where the information shows an 
(<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</EM>)  The available information demonstrates Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations.  She has 
been delinquent in payments on numerous accounts.  I conclude that FC DC E2.A6.1.2.1. and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets out Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition<EM> </EM>(FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.3. (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond 
the person's control (e.g., loss of employment or a death or divorce</EM>).  Loss of employment with periods of physical therapy following two automobile accidents 
and becoming a single parent after a divorce account for part of her financial problems.  FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. applies  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4.<EM> </EM>(<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or 
is under control</EM>) may apply.  FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. also may apply where <EM>(The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve bad debts).  </EM>She completed a financial counseling course.  She learned a great deal from the sessions and she is getting her finances under control.  All 
but one of the delinquent debts are paid, and the other is nearly one-half paid.  She has made a good-faith effort to bring her fiscal affairs in order.  Her financial 
statement indicates a substantial (nearly 60%) surplus each month after paying her debts.  FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4.<EM> </EM>and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has made significant and permanent behavioral changes regarding her finances, and I believe she will have these problems under control in the future.  
Balancing all the information, I conclude Guideline F for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline J.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A10.1.2.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
<EM>(Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged) </EM>applies.  Applicant failed to transfer her utility account 
from the landlord to her name, thus causing him to file charges.  She meantime paid restitution amounts to the property manager.  The case was dismissed.  
Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <EM>The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>, and CC MC E2.A6.1.3.2.  <EM>The crime was an isolated 
incident </EM>are applicable.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The more serious charge is the embezzlement of monies form her employer.  She made restitution before the arrest warrant was served on her.  Dishonesty in 
the workplace will disqualify a person from receiving a security clearance unless there are strong mitigating factors overriding the untrustworthiness of the 
person.  The only mitigating factor that might apply here is that found in CC MC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(<EM>The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>).  The crime occurred in 
2002, she entered her guilty plea in 2003, and was released from probation about three months prior to the hearing.  I find the conduct is recent and that CC MC 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">does not apply.  I find no other mitigating conditions that apply.  I conclude Guideline J against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Personal Conduct. </STRONG> The government has established its case under Guideline E.  Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) include PC DC 
E2.A5.1.2.2. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM> (the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities)</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM> </EM>and<EM> </EM>PC DC E2.A5.1.2.5. (<EM>A pattern of dishonesty)</EM> both apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government questions Applicant's trustworthiness because of her criminal activity and false answer on her SF 86.  Applicant was not forthright about her 
conduct, in particular not providing a truthful answer to question 20 on the SF 86, involving her termination from employment. Even though her employer did 
not contest her unemployment benefits, the response to her application set forth the reasons for her termination.  She was discharged for poor performance 
which is a material fact in determining suitability for a security clearance.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigation is difficult since she failed to make any attempt to correct her omission within the first six months of her executing her SF-86, and before the 
information came out at the hearing (over three years later).  Not only has the Appeal Board found the use of Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3.2.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> of the Adjudicative Guidelines (<EM>isolated, corrected falsification</EM>) to be unavailable to applicants seeking mitigation by treating the omission as 
isolated, but it has denied applicants availability of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(<EM>prompt, good faith disclosure</EM>) as well in circumstances (as here) where the applicant 
has failed to correct her omission much earlier in a good-faith way.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Compare </EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 97-0289 (January 1998) with DISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 
1995).  The Government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to classified information, and Applicant by her 
omission does not satisfy those high standards at this time.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>See Snepp v. United States, </EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">444 U.S. 507, 511n.6 (1980).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even more problematic is Applicant's embezzlement.  Employers expect honesty from their employees, and it is a critical factor in determining suitability for a 
security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the face of the totality of the evidence, her mitigation of financial considerations, her favorable character evidence, and recent 
employment contributions are not enough to absorb security concerns extant with the Government over her failure to be truthful in answering her security 
clearance application and by her dishonesty in the workplace.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">PC DC E2.A5.1.2.5. (<EM>A pattern of dishonesty</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) applies.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">PC MC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3.2. do not apply.  I conclude Guideline E against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that although Applicant has 
made considerable efforts to change her habits regarding finances and I believe that this type conduct is not likely to occur in the future, it has not been 
sufficiently successful to justify granting a clearance because of the issues of dishonesty.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This record raises reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant's 
ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its 
interests. Clearance is denied.</SPAN></P>
