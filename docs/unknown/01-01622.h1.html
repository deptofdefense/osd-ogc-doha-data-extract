<P>The recency and extent of applicant's criminal conduct, including a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001, precludes a finding that he currently possesses the good 
judgment required of individuals with access to our nation's secrets. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On February 12, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P>Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 4, 2002. The case was assigned to the undersigned on April 11, 2002. Notices of Hearing were issued on 
April 15 and May 1, 2002, and the hearing was held on May 15, 2002. The transcript was received on May 23, 2002.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a sixty-five year old security officer for a defense contractor.</P> 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>In March 1997, applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI). He was found guilty of the charge, fined $500.00, 
sentenced to ten days in jail, and his license was suspended for 180 days. A warrant for applicant's arrest was issued, and is still outstanding, because he has not 
yet paid the fine.</P> 
<P>In August 1992, applicant was working in a bar that he owned when he had to forcefully remove a customer from the bar. When he went to the police station to 
discuss the incident, he was informed by the police that the customer had filed a charge of Battery against him. The charge was eventually dismissed.</P> 
<P>In March 1989, applicant and his wife had a domestic dispute that turned violent. The police were called to their residence, but neither was arrested.</P> 
<P>In January 1984, applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He was found guilty of the charge, fined $417.00, sentenced to two days in jail, and placed on 
probation for three years.</P> 
<P>In 1981, applicant was arrested and charged with  DUI. He was acquitted of the charge.</P> 
<P>In November 1978, applicant was arrested and charged with DUI.  He was found guilty of the charge, fined $405.00, sentenced to one day in jail, and was 
placed on probation for two years.</P> 
<P>In August 1978, applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He was found guilty of the charge and was fined $305.00.</P> 
<P>In 1975, applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He was found guilty of a moving traffic violation, and fined $305.00.</P> 
<P>Despite the foregoing history of alcohol-related incidents, applicant does not believe he is an alcoholic (TR at 34). He attributes his alcohol-related problems to 
the fact that he spent much of his time working in bars (TR at 30-31). Applicant claims that he has not consumed alcohol since 1997 (TR at 33), and in a 
statement he gave to the Defense Security Service (DSS) in May 2000 (Exhibit 2), he stated "in the future I don't intend to drink."</P> 
<P>Applicant completed and executed a security clearance application (SCA) in July 1999. (Exhibit 1).  In response to Question 24 which asked, "Have you ever 
been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?  applicant stated "yes," and then disclosed his 1997  conviction for DUI. The 
Government alleges that applicant's response was false because he failed to disclose that he had also been charged with and/or convicted of alcohol-related 
offenses in 1984, 1981, twice in 1978, and in 1975. When asked to explain his response to Question 24, applicant testified that he believed he was required to 
disclose only those incidents that occurred during the previous five years (TR at 35). He then testified that he thought he was only required to go back seven 
years (TR at 36-37). Considering the evidence as a whole, including the very plain language of the question and applicant's inconsistent testimony, I find that 
applicant intentionally falsified his response to Question 24.<A HREF="01-01622.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>The only evidence offered by the Government to support the allegation that applicant is indebted to a state taxing authority in the amount of $981.00, and that 
he has had a state tax lien filed against him, is a credit report (Exhibit 5). This credit report, standing alone, does not constitute credible evidence that applicant 
is indebted to that state taxing authority. Accordingly, Guideline F is found for applicant.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth Guidelines (divided into conditions that could raise security concerns and conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns) which must be followed by the Administrative Judge. Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the following Guidelines are applicable:</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Disqualifying Conditions:</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>1. Alcohol-related incidents.  </P> 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigating Conditions:</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>2. The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem.</P> 
<P>3. Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Disqualifying Conditions</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>2. The deliberate omission of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire.  </P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Mitigating Conditions</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>None.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Disqualifying Conditions</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>1. Any criminal conduct.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>2. A single serious crime or multiple lessor offenses.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Mitigating Conditions</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>None.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>The evidence establishes that applicant was arrested for and convicted of DUI four times since 1978, the last time in 1997. The evidence further establishes that 
applicant intentionally falsified material facts on the SCA that he executed in July 1999 when he failed to disclose all of his alcohol-related charges and 
convictions in response to Question 24. This conduct reflects adversely on applicant's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness, and strongly suggests that he 
cannot be relied upon to safeguard classified information.</P> 
<P>With respect to Guideline G,  applicant has not consumed alcohol since 1997, and he does not intend to consume it in the future. In view of these facts, I 
conclude that applicant's past consumption of alcohol does not constitute a current security concern. For this reason, Guideline G is found for applicant.</P> 
<P>With respect to Guideline E, applicant's falsification of material facts on the SCA is extremely troubling. The Government relies heavily on the honesty and 
integrity of individuals seeking access to our nation's secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material facts on a security clearance application, 
it is extremely difficult to conclude that he or she nevertheless possesses the judgment, reliability and trustworthiness required of clearance holders. In this case, 
applicant offered no independent evidence that would mitigate the effect of his intentional falsification. For this reason, Guideline E is found against applicant.</P> 
<P>With respect to Guideline J, the recency and extent of applicant's criminal conduct (four DUI convictions and a violation of 18 U.S.C.1001, a felony) precludes 
a finding that it is now clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance. </P>
