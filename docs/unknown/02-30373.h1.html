<P>Applicant, a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor, was arrested for four alcohol-related offenses between 1994 and 1999 by security guards on an 
island atoll in the South Pacific where he lived and worked. The 1999 arrests caused Applicant to realize that he was developing a problem with alcohol and he 
returned to the U.S. mainland. The only punishment he received for any of the arrests was a letter of reprimand from the Army and six months probation for an 
arrest for public drunkenness. He did not list the arrests at Question 24 relating to his police record for alcohol offenses on his SF 86 because he did not regard 
the guards as police. Since 1999 he has changed his conduct having taken a course in anger management as affected by alcohol. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P> <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On December 19, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
<P>On January 13, 2004, Applicant, in a sworn written statement, responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, attached one exhibit and requested a hearing. 
The matter was assigned to me on April 19, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on May 10, 2004. A hearing was held on May 26, 2004. The Government 
introduced six exhibits and the Applicant none. All exhibits were admitted into evidence. The Applicant and six other persons testified. The transcript was 
received on June 2, 2004.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record, the 
following additional findings of fact are made:</P> 
<P>Applicant was arrested for four alcohol-related offenses in 1994, 1998, and two in 1999 on an island atoll in the South Pacific where he was working for his 
employer. The atoll consists of only 240 acres where 180 people live and work. He went there in 1991 and returned to the mainland U.S. in 1999. The 1999 
arrests caused Applicant to realize that he was developing a problem with alcohol as a result of the tropical party atmosphere on the island and that was a key 
factor in his decision to transfer to a stateside assignment. Applicant met his wife on the atoll and they now have one son. </P> 
<P>The only punishment he received for any of the arrests was a letter of reprimand from the Army and six months probation for the 1998 arrest for public 
drunkenness on a golf course. There is no evidence in the record of the terms of the probation or the source of the order. He did not list the arrests at Question 
24 relating to his police record for alcohol offenses on his SF 86 dated December 17, 2001.</P> 
<P>Applicant voluntarily reported in his answer to the SOR that he was involved in an argument in a bar with an employee of a competing company while on an 
overseas assignment in November 2002. This did not result in any legal difficulties but a fellow employees believed it indicated a behavioral problem and he 
was sent by his employer to an anger management course. The course lasted five weeks, four days a week, and four hours per session. He completed the course 
in 2003.</P> 
<P>He continues to attended an aftercare session of the program once a month. He believes the program has had a positive effect on him and helped him to 
overcome the anger problem and also to control drinking. Applicant now drinks beer moderately on social occasions. </P> 
<P>Applicant is highly regarded by his company. His supervisor and several fellow employees testified on his behalf concerning the type of work he performs, his 
value as a trusted crew member, his care concerning classified information, and his dedication to his job. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b)</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The first allegation concerns Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1 under Guideline G of the Directive (E2.A7.1.2.1.) raises the issue of 
alcohol related incidents away from work such as driving while under the influence or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use and consumption of 
alcohol to the point of impaired judgment (E2.A7.1.2.5.). The record of Applicant's four arrests clearly shows that the Government has established reasons to 
deny him a security clearance because of alcohol abuse under Guideline G. Mitigating conditions (MC) are applicable</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in that Applicant has shown that the problems with abuse of alcohol ended five years ago and that there is no indication of a recent problem. (E2.A7.1.3.2.) 
Evidence was submitted of positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety. (E2.A7.1.3.3.) <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Also alleged is Applicant's failure to report certain of the offenses under Guideline E that might indicate questionable judgment, unreliability, and 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information (E2.A5.1.1.). 
Specifically, the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a personnel security application could raise a security 
concern and be disqualifying. (E2.A5.1.2.2.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant interpreted the question to require an answer only if there were police records. He regarded the contract security guards on the island as only security 
guards and not police as they wore shorts and T-shirts with the word "Security" on the back with the name of the contractor. There were several military police 
on a larger neighboring island who occasionally came to his island. Three of the incidents resulted in documentation from the Provost Marshall's office 
submitted by the government at the hearing (Exh. 3, 5, and 6) but there is no indication that Applicant was notified of their involvement. The second arrest 
record (Exh. 4) is only a violation notice from the island Police Department with the notation that Applicant had refused to sign it. There is no indication that he 
was ever served with any follow up papers from the guards or the Provost Marshall's office. Testimony was offered by one of his colleagues on the island to 
support his contention that the security guards were not regarded as police officers. Based on his testimony and the reason given for the omission, I conclude 
that the omission was not "deliberate" as required in the guideline.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A history or pattern of criminal activity or any criminal conduct creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness under Criminal 
Conduct DC 1 under Guideline J. Mitigating Conditions (MC) are applicable in that the behavior was not recent (E2.A10.1.3.1.),and there is clear evidence of 
successful rehabilitation (E2.A10.1.3.6.). It has now been almost five years since his last offense. Applicant has changed his lifestyle and the departed from the 
environment that was contributing to his behavioral problems. He has also taken a helpful course of instruction on anger related to alcohol and continues a 
follow-up program.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant's admissions, the Government has established reasons to deny him a security clearance because of 
criminal conduct. Having established such reasons, the Applicant has the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or 
extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424 
(App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As the policy prescribes, the burden shifted to the Applicant to show that the mitigating conditions are applicable to him. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The "whole person" concept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits 
taking into consideration all relevant</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant has shown by his testimony and appearance at the hearing as 
well as his supporting statements from supervisors and colleagues, that he has changed his conduct in the last four years and is a reliable, trustworthy, and 
credible person. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that, because of the passage of 
time and the fact that the Applicant has changed his habits, the allegations relating to alcohol and criminal conduct in the SOR have been mitigated. He 
advanced a credible explanation of his failure to list information on the SF 86 to mitigate that allegation and justify the granting of a clearance.</SPAN></P>
