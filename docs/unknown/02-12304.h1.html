<P>Applicant's financial problems continue to raise security concerns over his failure to resolve approximately $9,500 in debt to six creditors. The record evidence 
is insufficient to mitigate or extenuate the negative security implications stemming from a debt of such magnitude.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 30, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="02-12304.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Security 
concerns were alleged under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F (Financial Considerations). DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 30, 2004, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On January 4, 2005, I was assigned the case. On March 11, 2005, a Notice of Hearing 
was issued scheduling the hearing which was held on March 30, 2005. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional documents.  On April 
14, 2005, several documents were received and admitted into the record. On April 8, 2005, DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits owing seven debts. This admission is incorporated herein as a findings of fact.  After a thorough review of the 
entire record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 30-year-old test technician who has worked for a defense contractor since March 2001, and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance.  
Applicant is regarded by those who know him as exhibiting good character, work ethic, trustworthiness, and competence (App Ex C).  He works well with 
others, performs his duties in an acceptable manner, and contributes to the success of his projects (App Ex D). He is responsible, dependable, and his work 
performance was consistently rated above average (App Ex E).  He is held in high regard by coworkers (App Ex F). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1997, Applicant and his wife co-signed on the purchase of a $20,389 car.  In 1998, he and his wife separated, and in June 1998 divorced, with her keeping 
the car. The car was later repossessed.  His wife then declared bankruptcy.  He first learned of the repossession three and a half years after the event, when it 
appeared on his credit report discovered while purchasing a car.  Applicant's February 2004 credit report (Gov Ex 5) indicates the car company charged off 
$6,906. In December 1998, he moved from one state to another. The financial impact of this move was not shown in the record. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 2001, Applicant's fianc&eacute;e had a baby.  In January 2002, his fianc&eacute;e lost her job.  In January 2002, Applicant was questioned about his debts.  His 
net monthly remainder then was $549.56 (Gov Ex 2). In July 2003, Applicant and his fianc&eacute;e were married. In July 2003, Applicant indicated he was falling 
behind on household bills.  After payday he had only enough money for gas (Gov Ex 3). His wife currently works for a temporary agency making $11 per 
hour.  His monthly income is approximately $3,600 (Tr. 27). With his wife working, their financial picture is improving.  He would do nothing to jeopardize 
his job.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Four years ago, Applicant was attending school.  He has a $9,000 student loan debt on which he makes $73 per month payments. He is pre approved for a 
home purchase up to $135,000. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant sought financial assistance to improve his credit score (App Ex A). He paid a financial consultant $1,000. The SOR lists three medical bills totaling 
approximately $600.  Applicant asserts a number of the debts were consolidated, but he still owed $152. Applicant submitted a letter from a collection agency 
indicating the city hospital bill was paid. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges Applicant owes approximately $10,000 on ten debts.  A summary of the status of those debts follows:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Disqualifying Conditions 
(DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense 
decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The 
adjudicative guidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent 
with the interests of national security. The presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative of a conclusion 
for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. 
Considering the evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant guideline to be applied here is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> </SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant. Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which 
disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is 
something less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial 
evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances which indicate an 
applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness 
required of persons handling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Once the government 
has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Additionally, an applicant has 
the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-12304.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." A 
person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for 
access to classified information to be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F, financial considerations. A person's relationship with his creditors is a private 
matter until evidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating 
or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding 
of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. An applicant 
who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Directive E.2.A.6.1.1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admitted owing seven debts and admitted co-signing on two other debts with his now ex-wife. The nine debts total approximately $10,000. 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (E2.A6.1.2.1 <EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and 3 (E2.A6.1.2.3 <EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>) 
apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has addressed four debts totaling approximately $624.  Applicant has denied the $84 cable bill (SOR paragraph 1.b) and the latest report showing the 
debt was January 1999.  I find for Applicant as to this debt.  He denies the debt and the most recent evidence of it is more than six years old. Applicant has paid 
two medical bills. I find for him as to the debts listed in SOR paragraphs 1.e. and 1.f.  He said he owed $152 on a third medical debt and would pay it by April 
15, 2005, however, he provided no supporting documentation that it was paid as promised.  Applicant renewed his contract with his telephone carrier.  He 
asserts the $395 telephone debt (SOR paragraph 1.j) was removed from his credit report after he challenged the debt.  I find for him as to this debt.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the Mitigating Conditions (MC) apply in the Applicant's favor to the remaining six debts. MC 1 (E2.A6.1.2.1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM> The behavior was not recent</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) does not 
apply because the conduct is recent since the debts remain unpaid. MC 2 (E2.A6.1.2.2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM> It was an isolated incident</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) does not apply because there are six debts. 
There was no showing the debts were caused by factors beyond Applicant's control.  In June 1998, Applicant divorced, however, he failed to substantiate the 
impact of the divorce, which occurred more than six years ago, on his current finances. His wife was unemployed for a time, but now that she is working their 
financial picture is improving. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has sought the services of a financial consultant to improve his credit score.  He has paid the consultant $1,000, for which the record is meager as to 
what Applicant received for this payment.  Seeking the services of a financial consultant is not equivalent to a demonstrated track record of financial reform 
and rehabilitation. Nor is there a showing Applicant's financial difficulties are under control. Therefore  MC4  (E2.A6.1.3.4. <EM>The person has received or is 
receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control</EM>) does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For MC 6 (E2.A6.1.2.6</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM> The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) to apply there must be an "ability" to 
repay the debts, the "desire" to repay, and evidence of a good-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling his debts is needed, which is not 
present here.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the six debts totaling approximately $9,500 remain unpaid, I find against Applicant on financial considerations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; 
the circumstances surrounding the conduct; Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency and recency 
of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or 
conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P>
