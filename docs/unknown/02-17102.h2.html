<P>Applicant was convicted of several offenses in 1980 and sentenced to more than a year in jail.  He has delinquent debts totaling more than $25,000.  Applicant 
mitigated his criminal conduct, but was denied a security clearance because of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 and financial considerations security concerns.  Applicant 
appealed.  The Appeal Board remanded the case for reconsideration in light of the amendments to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  The bar to obtaining a security clearance 
under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 no longer applies to Applicant, but Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 18 July 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-17102.h2.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 13 August 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The 
case was originally assigned to another judge, but was reassigned to me on 13 January 2004.  On 16 March 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 25 March 
2004.  I kept the record open to permit Applicant to provide a current credit report.  Applicant provided the report through Department Counsel on 22 March 
2004, and it was admitted into evidence as Exhibit E.</P> 
 
<P>In a decision dated 27 April 2004, I denied Applicant a clearance.  I found Applicant had mitigated the criminal conduct security concerns, but the Department 
of Defense was prohibited from granting him a clearance under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  That statute provided that, absent a waiver from the Secretary of Defense, the 
Department of Defense was prohibited from granting or continuing a security clearance for any applicant who, as a result of a conviction in any U.S. court, had 
been sentenced to more than a year in jail.  I also concluded Applicant had failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concern.  Applicant appealed 
that decision.  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">THE REMAND</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On 28 October 2004, the President signed into law amendments to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  The statute now provides that the prohibition on granting security 
clearances to applicants convicted of crimes for which they were sentenced to more than one year in jail applies only to cases in which the applicant actually 
served at least a year in jail.  </P> 
 
<P>As a result of that change, the Appeal Board remanded Applicant's case "for further processing consistent with [its] decision."  ISCR Case No. 02-17102 at 4 
(App. Bd. Nov. 5, 2004).  The avowed purpose of the remand was  "to allow the parties an opportunity--consistent with basic principles of due process--to 
present their views on the effect of Section 1062<A HREF="02-17102.h2.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> on Applicant's case."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 3.  The Board further required the administrative judge to "allow the Department 
Counsel the opportunity to obtain guidance and direction from appropriate Department of Defense officials as to the legal effect of Section 1062 on pending 
cases and how the Department of Defense proposes to implement the statute."  <EM>Id.</EM>  </P> 
 
<P>The Appeal Board is required to review the issues raised by the parties "to determine whether harmful error occurred."  Directive &para; E3.1.32.  The Board's scope 
of review is limited to determining whether</P> 
 
<P>(1) The administrative judge's findings of fact are supported by the evidence.  Directive &para; E3.1.32.1.</P> 
 
<P>(2) The administrative judge adhered to the procedures of the Directive.  Directive &para; E3.1.32.2.</P> 
 
<P>(3) The administrative judge's ruling or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive &para; E3.1.32.3.</P> 
 
<P>The Board has the authority to "[r]emand the case to an Administrative Judge to correct identified error."  Directive &para; E3.1.33.2.  </P> 
 
<P>In this case, the Board had before it a question of whether or not to apply to Applicant's case on appeal amendments to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 that had not been in 
effect at the time the administrative judge rendered his decision.  Such an issue is a matter of appellate law and one the Appeal Board is clearly responsible for 
answering.  If the purpose of the remand was merely to obtain the views of the parties on the applicability of the amendments to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, the Appeal 
Board could have requested briefs from the parties without remanding the case.  Similarly, if the purpose of the remand was to have policymakers in the 
Department of Defense decide the legal effect of the amendments to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 for the Board, the Appeal Board could have asked Department Counsel to 
submit the views of the Department of Defense.</P> 
 
<P>The adverse decision in Applicant's case was also based on his failure to mitigate the security concerns raised by his financial situation.  Unless the Board 
determined the administrative judge erred in finding against Applicant on Guideline F (Financial Considerations), the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 was 
moot.</P> 
 
<P>The Appeal Board does not have authority to remand a case to an administrative judge without identifying an error to be corrected,<A HREF="02-17102.h2.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and the Board did not 
identify such an error in Applicant's case.  Nevertheless, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I am not at liberty to disregard the Appeal Board's remand.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 03-16516 at 4 (App. 
Bd. Nov. 26, 2004) (an administrative judge must follow the Appeal Board's decision even if he disagrees with it). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I will consider the Board's remand as 
setting aside my decision and ordering a new decision considering the applicability of the amendments of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 to Applicant's case.<A HREF="02-17102.h2.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As the Board required, I sought the views of the parties.  Both parties informed me by telephone that they thought the amendments applied to Applicant's case 
and they did not wish to file additional briefs.  Department Counsel declined the opportunity to seek the views of the Department of Defense policy makers, as 
whether the amendments are retroactive is a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In December 1979, when Applicant was 19 years old, he lived with a friend whom he believed was not paying his fair share of the bills.  Applicant stole from 
his employer by taking money from the cash register.  Later that month, Applicant stole three checks from his roommate and used them by forging his 
roommate's signature.  Tr. 17-18.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In January 1980, Applicant was indicted on three counts of criminal possession of a forged instrument.  In February 1980, Applicant pled guilty to, and was 
convicted of, the three counts.  He was sentenced to two years' confinement on each offense, with the sentences to run concurrently.  As a result, Applicant was 
jailed until November 1980, when he was released on parole.  Ex. 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In May 1980, Applicant pled guilty to, and was convicted of, theft by failure to make required disposition of the money he took from his employer's cash

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted 9 of the 11 delinquent debts alleged.  He denied the debts alleged in &para;&para; 2.b. and 2.c. were delinquent and the

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was convicted in 1980 on three counts of criminal possession of a forged instrument (&para; 1.a.) and one count of failure to 
make required disposition (&para; 1.b.).  DOHA further alleged his sentences as a result of the possession of forged instruments disqualified him from holding a 
security clearance absent a waiver from the Secretary of Defense.  &para; 1.c.  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations in the SOR.  Applicant has a history of criminal 
conduct involving serious and lesser offenses.  DC E2.A10.1.2.2.  However, the criminal conduct is not recent-it all occurred almost 25 years ago.  MC 
E2.A10.1.3.1.  At the time of the offenses Applicant was only 19 years old and he has not committed had any further criminal conduct.  There is clear evidence 
of successful rehabilitation.  MC E2.A10.1.3.6.  Finding is for Applicant on &para;&para; 1.a. and 1.b.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 30 October 2000, the President signed 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 into law.  The law provided that, absent a waiver from the Secretary of Defense, the Department of 
Defense could not grant or continue a security clearance for any applicant who had been sentenced by a U.S. court to confinement for more than one year.  10 
U.S.C. &sect; 986.  By memorandum dated 7 June 2000, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued implementing criteria for the statute that required its application to 
cases in which the applicant did not actually serve any time in jail and cases that had previously been resolved favorably for an applicant.  Therefore, 10 U.S.C. 
&sect; 986 applied to Applicant even though he had not served any time in jail as a result of his convictions and his criminal convictions occurred well before the 
statute came into effect.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The 2004 amendments to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 provide that the prohibition on granting an applicant a clearance for criminal conduct applies only if he actually 
served at least a year in jail for his offense.  On reconsideration, I must determine whether to apply the amendments to Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Whether to apply a statute retroactively is generally a matter of congressional intent.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit, the court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the 
statute's proper reach.  If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to resort to judicial default rules.  When, however, the statute contains no such 
express command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i. e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when 
he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.  If the statute would operate 
retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Landgraf v. USI Film Products et al.</EM>, 511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Congress did not expressly prescribe whether the amendments to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 should apply retroactively.  Application of the amendments retroactively 
would not "impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already 
completed."  <EM>Id.</EM>  Therefore, there is no reason not to apply the amendments to Applicant's case.  I conclude 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 does not bar Applicant from 
receiving a clearance.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had 11 delinquent debts.  &para; 2.a.-2.k.   An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in 
illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations (DC 
E2.A6.1.2.1) and is unable or unwilling to satisfy his debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3.).  Some of the debts alleged as delinquent in the SOR, and admitted to by 
Applicant in his answer, do not appear on the credit report Applicant submitted.  Ex. E.  However, Applicant failed to demonstrate that these debts had been 
paid rather than just removed from the credit report for lack of payment.  Ex. E confirms the delinquent nature of several debts including those alleged in SOR 
&para;&para; 2.a., 2.h., 2.i., and 2.k.  In addition, Applicant refuses to pay the debt alleged in &para; 2.f.  The delinquent debts total well over $25,000.  Applicant failed to 
demonstrate that any of the mitigating conditions listed under the guideline apply.  After reviewing all of the evidence, and without viewing each debt in 
isolation, I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
