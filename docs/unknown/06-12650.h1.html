<P>Applicant has had a long history of financial difficulties. He currently has a significant amount of outstanding debt  which he  has not yet resolved.  Based on his tenuous financial situation and his 
history of financial irresponsibility, Applicant has failed to demonstrate a stable and mature outlook about his finances.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance is denied.</SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">July 15</SPAN>, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued 
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">December</SPAN> 20, 2005<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded in writing to the SOR allegations.</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September</SPAN> 19<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on September</SPAN> 20<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006, 
and the hearing was held on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">October</SPAN> 25<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1 through 7), and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered one documentary exhibit, (Applicant 
Exhibit A) and offered his own testimony. He also offered two post hearing documents which have been entered without objection (Applicant Exhibits B and C).  The transcript (Tr) was received 
on November</SPAN> 13<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I 
make the following Findings of Fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 40 year old employee of a defense contractor who seeks access to classified information.</SPAN> He is married and has three children. He served for twenty years in the United States  Navy.</P>

In his Response to the SOR (RSOR) and during his testimony, Applicant admitted all of 
the SOR allegations, and he confirmed that none of these debts had been paid at the time of the hearing. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The table below presents details about each debt as they were listed in the SOR: </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In </SPAN>addition to these debts listed on the SOR, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> testified at the hearing that he owes his brother and sister-in-law $5,000 on a personal loan that was made to <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> in <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">approximately</SPAN> Jan 
2003 (Tr at 26-27).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testified that he started making payments to a credit counseling company in August 2006. Exhibit B shows that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has $345 available for settlement and that he has made two 
payments of $224 to one of his creditors. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant cited several reasons for his history of failure to resolve his debts. These included: his youth and immaturity when he first received credit cards at 19 years of age,</SPAN> that he had to pay 
$1,200 for his mother-in-law's funeral, and that he had to pay additional money to aid his father-in-law. Finally, he was involved in an automobile accident, wherein he had to pay $8,000 to the 
other driver's insurance company. However, this occurred because of his less than responsible financial behavior, as he was driving his vehicle without current automobile insurance.    </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the overall common sense determination 
required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this 
policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether 
a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable 
participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>              Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to Applicant to 
establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of Applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and 
consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the 
Government raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As 
noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials."<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following:</SPAN>   <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline F, the Government has established that </SPAN>Applicant has had a long history of financial difficulties. The evidence has shown that Applicant has only recently started to take 
action to pay off these debts.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Clearly, he has a long way to go before his debts are resolved.</SPAN> Based on his tenuous financial situation and his history of financial irresponsibility, it is too soon to 
determine that Applicant has demonstrated a stable and mature outlook about his finances. I, therefore, resolve Guideline F against Applicant.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both DC E2.A6.1.2.1., and DC E2.A6.1.2.3 apply, because of Applicant's history of not meeting financial obligations 
and his inability and unwillingness to satisfy his debts. I find that none of the Mitigating Conditions (MC)  apply. </SPAN></P>
