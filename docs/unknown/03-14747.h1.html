<P>In February 2001, on two separate occasions one week apart, Applicant, then a decorated Staff Sergeant on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, was directed by 
his commander to report to the immunization clinic to receive his anthrax vaccination as part of his reassignment process.  He acknowledged receiving and 
understanding both orders, reported to the clinic as ordered, but refused to receive the vaccinations.  Nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, was 
subsequently imposed upon Applicant on two separate occasions, each for one specification for disobeying a lawful order, in violation of Article 92, UCMJ, for 
which he received reductions in grade.  In May 2001, based solely on those two incidents, he was administratively discharged with an Under Honorable 
Conditions (General) discharge.  He is now considered fully rehabilitated.  The questions and doubts as to his security eligibility and suitability have been 
satisfied.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On September 23, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated October 15, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing.  The case was 
assigned to me on March 10, 2005.  A notice of hearing was issued that same day, scheduling the hearing for March 31, 2005, and the hearing was held as 
scheduled.  Four government exhibits, 46 Applicant exhibits, and Applicant's testimony were received without controversy.  The transcript (Tr.) was received 
on April 11, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant had affixed four tabs of attachments to his answer to the SOR.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  At the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel objected to Applicant's 
Tab E and the 26 attachments which comprised the tab, citing, in part, the doctrine of <EM>collateral estoppel</EM>.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  As a result, the tabs were separated from the answer 
and handled separately.  As there was no objection to Tabs A through D, they were admitted as Applicant exhibits.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  One additional attachment was added to 
Tab D (attachment 14), an it too was admitted without objection.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Department Counsel also objected to a new Tab F (current status documents) consisting of 
three individual documents on the basis of relevancy.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>As to the government's position regarding <EM>collateral estoppel</EM>, while Department Counsel addressed the well-settled rule that an individual is generally estopped 
from challenging a <EM>criminal conviction</EM> in a subsequent civil action or federal administrative proceeding to preclude re-litigation of <EM>criminal</EM> <EM>convictions</EM>,<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> the 
government chose not to address the application of the rule to nonjudicial proceedings such as those under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice 
(UCMJ).<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Under these circumstances, two issues were raised negating the application of the rule in this particular instance, both of which require comment.  
First, the <EM>criminal convictions </EM>upon which the government has based the SOR, are not <EM>criminal convictions </EM>as contemplated for the rule to apply. Nonjudicial 
punishment, by its very nature, is a disciplinary measure which is less serious than trial by court-martial,<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> where punishment may be imposed for acts or 
omissions that are minor offenses.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> It does not rise to the level of being a <EM>criminal conviction </EM>involving a misdemeanor offense.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Second, Applicant is not 
attempting to re-litigate the prior nonjudicial punishment, but rather merely seeking to furnish evidence as to motivation for the actions that resulted in that 
punishment.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Accordingly, the government's objections to Tabs E and F were overruled and the exhibits were admitted.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant has admitted both of the factual allegations pertaining to criminal conduct under Guideline J (subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.) as well as the sole factual 
allegation pertaining to personal conduct under Guideline E (subparagraph 2.a.).  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.</P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to obtain a SECRET security clearance.  He had previously been granted a TOP 
SECRET security clearance with access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) in 1989 in connection with his active military service.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant entered active duty with the U.S. Air Force in February 1989,<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> and eventually rose to the grade of staff sergeant, the grade he held as of February 22, 
2001.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  During that period of superb and honorable service, he was awarded the following decorations, awards, and ribbons: Air Force Commendation Medal, 
Air Force Achievement Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Air Force Good Conduct Medal with 2 devices, Air Force Longevity Service Award with 2 
devices, Air Force Training Ribbon, Air Force Overseas Long Tour Ribbon, NCO Professional Military Education Ribbon, Air Force Outstanding Unit Award 
with 3 devices, and Air Force Organizational Excellence Award.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>His last six performance reports, covering the period April 1, 1995 thru September 20, 2000, are generally categorized as "firewall" appraisals recommending 
him for immediate promotion.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  His <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">lowest</SPAN> comments were: "highly effective," regarding his ability to supervise or lead, "consistently able to organize and 
express ideas clearly and concisely," regarding his ability to communicate, and "excellent performer. . . consistently produces high quality work," regarding the 
performance of his assigned duties.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>On December 6, 2000, an event occurred which altered Applicant's relationship with the U.S. Air Force and eventually led to a review of his security clearance 
review by DOHA, for on that date Applicant received a notification that he had been selected for reassignment--a permanent change of station--from an 
assignment in the U.S. to an overseas (European) location.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  The appropriate paperwork was completed and Applicant's departure date was approved for July 
1, 2001.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  However, in late January 2001, Applicant was also selected for a sanctioned contingency temporary deployment to Kuwait with a projected departure 
date of March 1, 2001.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>As part of the entire reassignment process, Applicant was required to participate in the Department of Defense (DOD) Anthrax Vaccination Immunization 
Program (AVIP) and undergo a series of Anthrax vaccinations.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  On February 7, 2001, Applicant stated his intention to not participate in AVIP:<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  "[I]f given a 
direct order to take the vaccine, I cannot in good conscience, comply."<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  He was directed to consult with the local Area Defense Counsel the following day.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  
On February 16, 2001, Applicant was directed by his Squadron Section Commander to report to the immunization clinic that same morning to receive his first 
anthrax shot.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  He acknowledged receiving and understanding the order,<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> reported to the clinic as ordered, but refused to receive the vaccination.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  One week 
later, on February 23, 2001, the scenario was repeated.  He was again directed by his Squadron Section Commander to report to the immunization clinic that 
same afternoon to receive his first anthrax shot.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  He acknowledged receiving and understanding the order,<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> reported to the clinic as ordered, but again refused 
to receive the vaccination.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>On February 23, 2001, nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, was imposed upon Applicant for one specification for disobeying a lawful order, in 
violation of Article 92, UCMJ, for which he received a reduction to the grade of senior airman and a reprimand.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  One week later, on March 2, 2001, 
nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, was again imposed upon Applicant for one specification for disobeying a lawful order, in violation of Article 
92, UCMJ, for which he received a reduction to the grade of airman first class and a reprimand.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A>  On April 5, 2001, Applicant was notified by his Headquarters 
Squadron Commander that he was being recommended for discharge for Minor Disciplinary Infractions, based solely on his two failures to obey a written order 
regarding the Anthrax vaccinations.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>  During a pre-board hearing, Applicant sought to submit a package of approximately 25 documents upon which he relied 
in making his decision to refuse the Anthrax vaccinations, but the evidence was rejected by the legal advisor.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A>  Because of the rulings during the pre-board 
hearing, Applicant felt he could not get a fair hearing absent his evidence, and on May 8, 2001, he submitted a conditional waiver of his right to a discharge 
board hearing contingent upon his receiving no less than an Under Honorable Conditions (General) discharge.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A>  That discharge was approved by the Wing 
Commander,<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> and he was discharged on May 21, 2001.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>On October 27, 2004, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for the second time, issued an injunction against the current operation of 
AVIP.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A>  The court commented:<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>By refusing to give the American public an opportunity to submit meaningful comments on the anthrax vaccine's classification, the [FDA] violated the 
Administrative Procedure Act. . . . Congress has prohibited the administration of investigational drugs to service members without their consent.  This Court 
will not permit the government to circumvent this requirement.  The men and women of our armed forces deserve the assurance that the vaccines our 
government compels them to take into their bodies have been tested by the greatest scrutiny of all - public scrutiny.  This is the process the FDA in its expert 
judgment has outlined, and this is the course this Court shall compel FDA to follow.</P> 
<P>That same day, the Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum acknowledging an AVIP pause, but added that "DoD remains convinced that the AVIP 
complies with all legal requirements and that anthrax vaccine is safe and effective."<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A>  Two days later, by routine message, the U.S. Air Force directed an 
immediate pause directing that, until further notice, all anthrax vaccinations to all military and civilian personnel, including family members and contractor 
personnel, be stopped.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A>  An exception to the pause was granted by the court in February 2005, wherein DOD was permitted to administer the vaccination on a 
voluntary basis.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A>  As of the date the record herein closed, the AVIP was still in a pause status.</P> 
<P>Applicant has been employed by the same government contractor since May 29, 2001, where he is now a System Administrator.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A>  While former supervisors 
and coworkers were very supportive of his efforts to obtain an honorable discharge during his difficulties while being processed for discharge, there has been no 
characterization of his current work performance.</P> 
<P>Applicant was married in 1989, and he and his wife have three children, born in 1993, 1994, and 1997, respectively.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
<P>An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, 
of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct-Guideline J: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct-Guideline E: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to each of the 
adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below<STRONG>..</STRONG></P> 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest." For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere 
speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government meets 
its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to 
overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the government must be 
able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of witness credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and 
conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case under Guideline J.  On February 16, 2001, Applicant was directed by his Squadron Section Commander to report to the 
immunization clinic that same morning to receive his first anthrax shot.  He acknowledged receiving and understanding the order, reported to the clinic as 
ordered, but refused to receive the vaccination.  One week later, on February 23, 2001, the scenario was repeated.  He was again directed by his Squadron 
Section Commander to report to the immunization clinic that same afternoon to receive his first anthrax shot.  He acknowledged receiving and understanding 
the order, reported to the clinic as ordered, but again refused to receive the vaccination.  Applicant's disobedience of both of those lawful orders, justified by 
him as jeopardizing his health, was contrary to good order and discipline and violations of the UCMJ.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Accordingly, on February 23, 2001, nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, was imposed upon Applicant for one specification for disobeying a lawful 
order, in violation of Article 92, UCMJ, for which he received a reduction to the grade of senior airman and a reprimand.  One week later, on March 2, 2001, 
nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, was again imposed upon Applicant for one specification for disobeying a lawful order, in violation of Article 
92, UCMJ, for which he received a reduction to the grade of airman first class and a reprimand.  Applicant's criminal conduct, consisting solely of those two 
incidents, one week apart, clearly falls within Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>allegations or admissions of criminal 
conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>) and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As noted above, Applicant justified, in his own mind, his disobedience of both orders due to concerns over the safety of the anthrax vaccination.  It appears that 
AVIP has been reduced, suspended, resumed, and paused on several occasions since it was instituted in 1997, and it was seemingly suspended from July 2000 
to June 2002--including the period during which Applicant's disobedience occurred.<A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A>  It currently remains in a pause status with the exception of voluntary 
acceptance of the vaccination which was permitted commencing earlier this year.  While the orders to participate in AVIP were apparently lawful, they may not 
have been wise and seemingly followed a series of similar historical instances involving what were officially considered safe programs: Agent Orange, swine 
flu vaccine, Gulf War Syndrome, and the Hepatitis C virus exposure.  Nevertheless, as the U.S. Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals had previously noted in a 
similar case: <A HREF="03-14747.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Military personnel are inoculated to protect them personally, and as part of a fighting unit, so they can perform the mission under adverse conditions.  The 
[Applicant's] refusal to be inoculated is a direct flouting of military authority and detracted from the ability of his unit to perform its mission. A military 
accused cannot justify his disobedience of a lawful order by asserting that his health would be jeopardized.  Putting one's life on the line for the sake of the 
mission is the very essence of military duty.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person should not be held forever accountable for actions from the past if there is a clear indication of subsequent reform, remorse, or rehabilitation.  In this 
instance, Applicant's two incidents of disobedience of a lawful order while in the military occurred within one week of each other in February 2001--over four 
years before the DOHA hearing.  The incidents of misconduct were preceded and succeeded by no other criminal conduct.  An otherwise superb military career 
was terminated by the two incidents, his nonjudicial punishment for them, and his subsequent Under Honorable Conditions (General) discharge.  Furthermore, 
the unquestioned obligations that a military member has regarding a lawful order are not the same as the obligation of a civilian contractor.  A civilian 
contractor, the status Applicant currently occupies, can refuse to comply with the order of a superior to take an Anthrax vaccination and not be charged with a 
violation of criminal law as the UCMJ does not apply to him.</SPAN></P>

believe the obligations to participate in AVIP, a program which continues in a pause status because of serious concerns over the safety of the program, no

believe Applicant's actions, as unacceptable as they were to military authorities, justified an Under Other Than Honorable Conditions (UOTHC) discharge, and 
higher authorities agreed with him.  Examination of Applicant's military record justified the General, or higher form of discharge, which "is appropriate when
