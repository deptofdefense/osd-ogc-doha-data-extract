<P>Applicant was discharged from the U.S. Air Force in 1997 for a pattern of misconduct. Applicant reported his discharge on his security clearance application, 
but not the exact details of a nonjudicial punishment he received. Applicant's statement to a security investigator was not totally accurate. Applicant mitigated 
the personal conduct security concerns. Clearance is granted. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 &para; E3.1.2 (Jan 2. 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 24 Mar 2005 detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 4 June 2005 and elected to have a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 29 November 2005. On 10 February 2006, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 16 February 2006.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 34-year-old test technician for a defense contractor. He has been married since October 1993 and has two children. Applicant's supervisor at his 
current position finds him to be capable, knowledgeable, and professional in all he does.</P> 
<P>Applicant served in the U.S. Air Force from September 1989 until November 1997. Upon completion of his first enlistment in 1994, he received an honorable 
discharge. In 1995, he was admonished for failing to properly document maintenance work on an aircraft; counseled for taking home an electronic module 
(KYK-13) used to load cryptographic keys into electronic encryption machines; counseled for failing to complete training by the required date; counseled for 
missing duty without proper authorization; and punished, under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), for disorderly conduct and assault. In 
1997, he received two reprimands for failing to report for duty at the appropriate time; a reprimand for making sexually harassing remarks; and a counseling for 
being late for a mandatory formation. Based on this conduct, he was separated from the service prior to the completion of his second enlistment, with a general 
discharge under honorable conditions, for a pattern of misconduct-conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline.</P> 
<P>On 20 February 2002, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) by certifying that his statements therein were "true, complete, and correct" to 
the best of his knowledge and belief, and by acknowledging that any knowing and willful false statement could be punished under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 by fine 
and/or imprisonment. Question 25 asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had been subject to disciplinary proceedings under the UCMJ to include 
nonjudicial punishment. Applicant answered "yes" and listed the nature of the offense as misconduct and the action taken against him as "discharge."</P> 
<P>After being interviewed by a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent, Applicant submitted a signed, sworn statement on 11 December 2003. In the statement, 
Applicant claimed he took the KYK-13 home, but returned it to the base and reported it to proper authorities. The incident occurred on 18 July 1995. Applicant 
was briefed that the KYK-13 should not be left unattended if loaded and, if it was not needed, to turn it in. Applicant took the KYK-13 home. The following 
morning, another airman could not find the KYK-13. He went to Applicant's house. Applicant gave him the KYK-13 to bring take back to the base.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant received a general discharge under honorable conditions from the U.S. Air Force in December 1997 for a pattern of 
misconduct (&para; 1.a); falsified material facts on his SCA by omitting a nonjudicial punishment he received in the Air Force in 1995 (&para; 1.b); and falsifying a 
statement to an investigator about taking a KYK-13 home (&para; 1.c). Applicant admitted the allegation in &para; 1.a, but denied the others, with explanation. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct 
involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could 
indicate the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern that is possibly disqualifying may be raised when there is reliable unfavorable information about an applicant. DC E2.A5.1.2.1. An applicant 
may also be disqualified for a pattern of rules violations. DC E2.A5.1.2.5. The evidence established the applicability of both of these disqualifying conditions to 
the allegation in &para; 1.a. Applicant was discharged from the Air Force with a considerable history of misconduct and failing to follow established rules for 
personal behavior. On the other hand, these incidents occurred almost 10 years ago and there is no current history of other unfavorable information or rules 
violations. I find for Applicant on &para; 1.a.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The deliberate omission of relevant and material facts from any SCA is a security concern and may be disqualifying. DC E2.A5.1.2.2. Deliberately providing 
false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator in connection with a security clearance may also be disqualifying. 
DC E2.A5.1.2.3. Information is material if it would affect a final agency decision or, if incorrect, would impede a thorough and complete investigation of an 
applicant's background. ISCR Case No. 01-06870, 2002 WL 32114535 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2002). An applicant's military disciplinary history is a matter that 
could affect a final agency decision on whether to grant the applicant a clearance, and his failure to disclose it would impede a thorough investigation of the 
applicant's background.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After carefully reviewing all of the evidence, I am not convinced Applicant deliberately falsified his SCA. In answer to question 25, he reported that he had 
been disciplined for misconduct and that it led to his eventual discharge from the Air Force. While it may not have been as complete a statement as it should 
have been, it did provide the essentials from which the Government knew it needed to further investigate Applicant before granting him a clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find for 
Applicant on &para; 1.b.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Likewise, I am not convinced Applicant deliberately provided a false or misleading statement to the DSS agent. The incident with the KYK-13 occurred in July 
1995, more than eight years before he completed his statement. It is understandable that he would not remember all of the details of the incident. Applicant 
understands the need for total candor on his SCA and in his statements and will be more careful in the future. I find for Applicant on &para; 1.c.</SPAN></P>
