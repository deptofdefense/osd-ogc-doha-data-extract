</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 5, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review</EM> <EM>Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing why, pursuant to Guideline J-Criminal Conduct, it could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant.  In his response, dated November 26, 2004, Applicant admitted two of the allegations set forth in the SOR and 
admitted in part and denied in part the remaining two allegations.  In that same response, Applicant also elected to have this matter determined on the record. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's case was submitted on December 29, 2004, and a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="03-17542.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> was provided to Applicant.  
Applicant received a copy of the FORM on January 13, 2005.  Having been afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit evidence in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation of the allegations, Applicant, on February 9, 2005, responded with further explanation and two letters of support.  I was assigned this 
case on February 17, 2005</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted to two of the allegations set forth in the SOR, and admitted in part and denied in part the third allegation, all of which pertain to 
Criminal Conduct - Guideline J.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 45 year-old software engineer employed by a defense contractor.  In 1990, he was charged with Disorderly Conduct and Resisting Arrest, 
resulting in a fine of approximately $80.00.  In 1991, Applicant was charged with Trespassing Property After Warning.  He pled <EM>nolo contendere</EM>, had 
adjudication of guilt withheld, and paid court costs of $85.00.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 30, 2000, while maneuvering her car from the left lane into the Applicant's right hand lane in order to make an upcoming right hand turn, an 
automobile driver cut Applicant off.  When that driver turned, Applicant followed.  At a light, Applicant left his truck, banged on the other driver's window, 
and yelled at the driver.  He was given "the middle finger."<A HREF="03-17542.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  He then returned to his vehicle and proceeded to chase the other driver until the two vehicles 
eventually collided.  While the on-site investigation took place and the question as to whether Applicant intentionally collided into the other driver was 
examined, one officer told Applicant that "trying to contact other drivers about driving behaviors could be dangerous and he should not do it."  In response, 
Applicant stated, "You've got to be kidding me. You mean I'm just supposed to let someone just drive away?"<A HREF="03-17542.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  On May 3, 2000, Applicant was arrested for 
Deadly Conduct for this aggressive driving. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Again, on November 15, 2000, Applicant was cut-off in traffic.  Tailgating ensued that resulted in the two vehicles making impact.  Applicant stopped and ran 
back to the other driver, who was stuck in his own vehicle.  Using his right fist, Applicant struck the other driver's windshield twice, causing two indentations 
and spidering cracks to appear.  Applicant then left the scene, but not before the second driver was able to identify Applicant's license number.  On December 
5, 2000, after being identified in a lineup, Applicant was arrested on a charge of Criminal Mischief.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 23, 2001, Applicant pled guilty with regard to the March 2000 incident.  He was given deferred adjudication, 18 months probation, a $750.00 fine 
plus court costs, and ordered to attend Anger Management classes.  Subsequently, Applicant pled guilty to the November 2000 incident, for which he received 
90 days labor detail, fined $1,500.00, plus court costs, and ordered to pay $225.00 in restitution.  Applicant satisfied the judgments, including the completion of 
the Anger Management class.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the Applicant's state, the qualifications for certification as a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) are quite numerous and rigid.  Once licensed, an LPC 
may prevent, assess, evaluate, and treat mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders and distresses that interfere with mental health, and may also implement 
and evaluate treatment plans using interventions.  In 2001, Applicant regularly met with such a LPC for 16 sessions over a 10 month period regarding his 
attitude, behavioral volatility, and social judgment.  The LPC certified that Applicant, working within a primarily Cognitive Therapy model, made a "significant 
recovery."  This learning and rehabilitative process included identification of stressors and how to make appropriate attitudinal and behavioral changes.  
Applicant was reassessed by the LPC on February 1 and February 8, 2005.  The LPC determined that Applicant's recovery remains intact and noted that he had 
no concerns regarding Applicant's capabilities.<A HREF="03-17542.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's supervisor attests to the Applicant's reliability and trustworthiness, noting that he has demonstrated the ability to mentor others and teach co-workers the appropriate ways to safeguard information.  The supervisor notes that he is aware of Applicant's behavioral issues and that Applicant has been 
forthcoming to identify them so that they could work on them in the appropriate manner together.  The supervisor also notes that he does not view Applicant's 
behavior to be a threat to his security clearance and strongly recommends that his clearance be retained.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, these adjudicative guidelines are subdivided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or 
revoke one's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to determine one 
could still be eligible for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In application, an Administrative Judge is not strictly bound to the adjudicative guidelines. They are guidelines.  As such, they are but part of an amalgam of 
elements for the Administrative Judge to consider in assessing an applicant in light of the circumstances giving rise to the SOR, as well as in assessing the 
applicant as a whole.  The concept of the "whole person"<A HREF="03-17542.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> means that all available, reliable information about the person - whether it is good or bad, present or 
past - should be considered in making a fair, impartial, and meaningful decision as to his or her suitability to hold a security clearance.  To that end, Enclosure 2 
also sets forth factors to be considered during this part of the adjudicative process, including: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individuals age and 
maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; 
(7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline J-Criminal Conduct.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>The Concern.  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubts about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After a full and thorough examination, however, the final assessment must comport with the considerable gravity of the final decision.  There is no right to a 
security clearance</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-17542.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and one seeking access to classified information must be prepared to enter into a fiduciary relationship with the United States Government 
that is inherently predicated on trust and confidence.  Therefore, when the facts proven by the Government raise doubts as to an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has the heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-17542.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  
Therefore, any doubts will be resolved in favor of the national security, not the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Finally, Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that 
industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned."  Therefore, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied 
determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all legal precepts, factors, and conditions, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">including those described briefly above, I find 
the following with respect to the allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">With respect to Guideline J-Criminal Conduct, the Government has established its case.  Applicant's police record since 1990  includes four separate incidents 
from which arrests and charges were derived for Disorderly Conduct, Resisting Arrest, Trespassing Property After Warning, Deadly Conduct, and Criminal 
ischief, the last two of which occurred in 2000.  Such conditions raise a security concern, as well as </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) 
E2.A10.1.1 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>) and E2.A10.1.2.2. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a single serious crime 
or multiple lesser offenses).</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In order to mitigate</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> this concern, Applicant must turn to the Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) found at E2.A10.1.3</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.  Here, Applicant's 
criminal record consists of a string of lesser offenses.  Moreover, none of the resultant charges were resolved by an acquittal.  Therefore, neither CC MC 
E2.A10.1.3.2. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the crime was an isolated incident</EM>) nor CC MC E2.A10.1.3.5 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>acquittal</EM>) apply.  Further, Applicant was neither pressured nor coerced into 
committing the offenses at issue, therefore CC MC E2.A10.1.3.3 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no 
longer present in that person's life</EM>) does not apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Mitigation may be raised, however, under CC MC E2.A.10.1.3.6 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>).  Applicant, on his own initiative, chose 
to complement his court ordered class in anger management by seeking counseling with a LPC.  In Applicant's state, a LPC is subject to particularly rigorous 
state licensure requirements and, upon licensure, is authorized to assess, evaluate, and treat behavioral disorders.<A HREF="03-17542.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  During his treatment, Applicant was taught 
how to identify his stressors and how to manage his conduct by making appropriate attitudinal and behavioral changes.  Given Applicant's nearly year-long 
treatment, his successful completion of that counseling, his recent, successful, reevaluation, and his LPC's recommendation, I find that there is clear evidence of 
successful rehabilitation.  Therefore, I find that mitigation is raised under CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Moreover, Applicant has remained both in control and incident free for nearly five years.  Given his progress and his commitment to prophylactically manage 
both his attitude and his behavioral responses, future incidents of such inappropriate behavior should become considerably minimized, if not eliminated 
completely.  Therefore, I additionally find that CC MC E2.A10.1.3.4. (<EM>the person did not voluntarily commit the act and/<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">or the factors leading to the violation 
are not likely to recur</SPAN></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">)(emphasis added) applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, taken piecemeal, half the incidents occurred in 1990/1991, a time distant in the past, while the other half took place in 2000, a time no longer 
recent.  As well, taken as a whole, Applicant's pattern of criminal conduct came to a close with the November 2000 incident, with the potential of recurrence 
considerably reduced by Applicant's subsequent rehabilitation.  Either way, neither his criminal history nor pattern are recent.  Therefore, CC MC E2.A10.1.3.1 
(<EM>the criminal behavior was not recent</EM>) also applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Looking at the whole person, Applicant seems to be evolving.  At age 30, he was arrested for Disorderly Conduct and Resisting Arrest; a year later, he was 
arrested for Trespass After Warning.  Consequentially, he complied with the court's orders, but did nothing more.  At age 40, he again  found himself arrested 
twice - this time for incidents arising from extremely aggressive driving practices in which he posed a danger to his target, himself, and everyone in between.  
What differs between Applicant at 30 and Applicant at 40, however, is his response to his arrests.  As a more mature man, he went beyond passive compliance 
with the dictates of the court and took proactive steps to address the problem underlying his arrests - specifically, his behavior and situational judgment:  
Demonstrating a degree of maturity, responsibility, and judgment that he clearly lacked at age 30,  Applicant, pro-actively and on his own initiative, sought and 
completed an appropriate therapy with a licensed professional in order to modify his behavior and to learn acceptable responses to various stressors.  Since 
completing that regimen, he has experienced no relapses and, given the results of his recent reassessment, demonstrated that his behavioral control remain in 
check.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the expressions of responsibility cited above, and in view of both his supervisor's continued support and personal assessment regarding Applicant's 
suitability for a clearance, I find that Applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, as reflected by his past history or pattern of criminal activity, no 
longer poses a risk to national security.  Indeed, based on the record evidence as a whole, the facts and circumstances in this matter, and Applicant's proffer 
regarding reform and rehabilitative efforts, I find that Applicant has met his burden in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's security clearance.  Finally, owing to the age of the conduct at issue and Applicant's rehabilitation, I consequentially find subparagraphs 
1.a. through 1.d. of the SOR in Applicant's favor. </SPAN></P>
