<P>Applicant was politically active when he was a student in Sudan, where much of his family still resides.  The military junta that overthrew the government of

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 11 September 2003, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="03-00543.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="03-00543.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 30 September 2003 and elected to have a 
hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 27 October 2003.  On 2 December 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 8 
December 2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 49-year-old native of Khartoum, Sudan.  He is married to a native of Sudan.  Applicant and his wife became naturalized U.S. citizens on 18 
January 2002.  Applicant's two children, who were minors, became U.S. citizens as a result of their parent's naturalization.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant and his sister attended university in Khartoum, where they were both politically active.  As a dental student, Applicant traveled to the U.S. as his 
school's representative to the General Assembly of the International Dental Students Association.  He returned to Sudan and, after graduating from dental 
school, went to work for the Ministry of Health.  He moved to Saudi Arabia in 1982, where from 1983 until 1989 he worked for the Saudi Ministry of Health as 
a dentist in a remote area of the country .  He came to the U.S. in 1989 on a visitor visa with the intention of taking the U.S. dental exams and, if he passed, 
staying in the U.S.  If he failed the exams, he intended to purchase dental equipment and return to Sudan to establish a dental clinic there.  Tr. 23.  While 
Applicant was in the U.S., the Government of the Sudan was overthrown by a military junta.  Applicant's father suggested it would be better for him to stay in 
the U.S. if he could.  Applicant passed the first part of the dental exams, but was unable to pass the second part.</P> 
 
<P>In 1990, Applicant went to work for the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Washington, DC, as a interpreter and facilitator for Saudi nationals traveling to the U.S. for 
medical treatment.  His Sudanese passport expired and he acquired a Saudi diplomatic passport and an A2 (diplomatic) U.S. visa.  Applicant left his 
employment with the Saudi Embassy in 1997.  Shortly thereafter, Applicant began working for a state university hospital as a laboratory technician.  In 2002, 
shortly after he became a naturalized U.S. citizen, he received his U.S. passport.  From December 2002 - September 2003, Applicant worked for a defense 
contractor and was deployed to Saudi Arabia as a translator for the U.S. Air Force.  When the contract was terminated because of the base closure, he was 
awarded a certificate of appreciation for his outstanding support of the military mission and his selfless devotion to duty.  Ex. A.  </P> 
 
<P>Two of Applicant's brothers, four sisters, and his mother are all citizens and residents of Sudan.  Applicant and his family actively opposed the coup that took 
control of Sudan in 1989.  Tr. 29.  Although several members of Applicant's family wish to come to the U.S., the Government has refused to issue them exit 
visas.  Tr. 49.  The sister who was politically active at university was a human rights attorney in Sudan.  After the Government of Sudan was overthrown in 
1989, she was interrogated about her activities by government authorities for at least two days.  Tr. 25.  She is now a U.S. citizen residing in the U.S.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's father, who is deceased, was a school teacher.  Applicant's mother receives a pension from the government because of her husband's work as a 
school teacher.  As the pension is low, Applicant supports his mother in the amount of $100 to $150 per month.  Tr. 33.  Applicant talks to his mother by phone 
every month or so.  Applicant was unable to return home until an amnesty was announced in 1999.  He returned home to visit his mother in 2000 and 2002.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's parents-in-law are citizens and residents of Sudan.  Tr. 44.  Applicant has various other relatives in Sudan he contacts on an occasional basis.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P>

<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant has the following contacts who are citizens and residents of Sudan: his mother (&para;1.a.); his two brothers (&para; 1.b.); his four 
sisters (&para; 1.c.); his parents-in-law (&para; 1.d.); members of his extended family (&para; 1.e.); and friends and associates (&para; 1.f.).  A security risk may exist when an 
applicant's immediate family, and other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject 
to duress.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that he has immediate family members, and others to whom Applicant is 
bound by affection, who are citizens and residents of a foreign country.  DC E2.A2.1.2.1.  </SPAN>A determination that an applicant's foregin associates are not agents 
of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force an applicant to choose between loyalty to the family member or 
associate and loyalty to the U.S. is a mitigating condition under Guideline B.  MC 1.  Applicant presented evidence that his foreign associates are not agents of 
a foreign power.  However, t<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he inquiry in a foreign influence case is not limited to consideration of whether the foreign contacts or connections are agents of a 
foreign power.  Rather, the foreign contacts or connections must also be evaluated in terms of whether they place an applicant in a <EM>position of vulnerability </EM>to be 
influenced by coercive or noncoercive means, even if there is no evidence that a foreign country has sought to exploit that vulnerability.  ISCR Case No. 00-0628 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2003)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government of Sudan is an authoritarian regime run by an alliance of the military, that seized power in 1989, and a political party that espouses an Islamist 
platform.  Central Intelligence Agency, <EM>The World Factbook</EM>,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/su.html">http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/su.html</A>.  The leaders of the 1989 coup knew 
Applicant and his sister because they were at the university at the same time.  The Government of Sudan specifically targeted Applicant and his sister for 
interrogation and intimidation because of their political beliefs.  Tr. 26.  The Government of Sudan also denied members of Applicant's family exit visas to 
leave the country.  Although the evidence clearly supports Applicant's contention that he is a loyal U.S. citizen, his family members and foreign associates in 
Sudan clearly put him in a position of vulnerability.  Under all the circumstances of this case, I find against Applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
