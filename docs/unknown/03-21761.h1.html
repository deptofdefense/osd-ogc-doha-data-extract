<P>Applicant has a lengthy history of alcohol-related criminal conduct. Applicant falsified his security clearance application by deliberately omitting information 
about charges and convictions related to alcohol. He failed to mitigate security concerns raised by his criminal conduct, alcohol consumption, and personal 
conduct. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 14 January 2005, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-21761.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline G (Alcohol 
Consumption), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 2 February 2005 and elected to have a hearing 
before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 24 March 2005.  On 18 April 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 28 April 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is 50 years old and employed by a defense contractor as a packer/shipper of military material. His manager reports Applicant is a reliable and diligent 
employee and exceptional team player. Ex. A. He has been employed there since November 2002. Tr. 15.</P> 
<P>Applicant served in the U.S. Air Force for 20 years as a munitions specialist. He retired in September 1994 as a staff sergeant (E-5). Tr. 18. Applicant was 
married from 1975-78 and the couple had a daughter. They divorced after his wife refused to accompany him to an overseas duty location. Applicant met a 
woman in the overseas location who came to the U.S. and married Applicant in 1984. She returned to her home overseas in 1985. Applicant was again stationed 
in that location from 1986-89 and they lived together. She declined to return to the U.S. when his tour overseas was completed. He has not had contact with her 
or their child in more than 11 years. Ex. 11 at 2. He has another daughter who is almost six years old by a third woman.</P> 
<P>In 1975, Applicant drank to the point of intoxication with a friend. When he returned to the military installation, he "was getting a little rowdy and had an 
accident with a window in the laundry room." Tr. 18. He had to be taken to the hospital to have stitches. He was charged with drunk and disorderly conduct. Tr. 
18-19.</P> 
<P>In 1977, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) in a civilian jurisdiction. He pled guilty to the offense and was fined $500. 
Tr. 19.</P> 
<P>In 1987, Applicant was arrested by U.S. military authorities overseas for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). He received nonjudicial punishment for 
the offense. At the time, Applicant was an E-5 but was on the list to be promoted to E-6. He ended up being reduced in grade to E-4. Tr. 19-20. </P> 
<P>In October 1991, Applicant was arrested at his home for domestic assault. He was very intoxicated at the time of his arrest. Ex. 9 at 2. Applicant pled guilty to 
the charge of assault and his plea was held in abeyance for a year. As Applicant had no other similar violations over the next year, the court permitted the guilty 
plea to be withdrawn and the charge was dismissed. <EM>Id.</EM> at 5.</P> 
<P>On 1 January 1993, Applicant was arrested for sexual abuse of a child, a second degree felony. Applicant was living with a woman and her six or seven year old 
daughter. The girl's father made the complaint. It appears charges were not levied until 1996. The charge was eventually dismissed and Applicant had it 
expunged from his record. Ex. 11 at 3-4; Tr. 25-26. </P> 
<P>In March 1995, Applicant was arrested for drunk driving on a military installation twice within a week. He pled guilty to one of the charges before a U.S. 
magistrate. He was sentenced to one year on probation and a fine of $1,000. Ex. 11 at 2.</P> 
<P>In August 1997, Applicant was arrested for public intoxication. The police found him passed out in his vehicle in the parking lot of a bar. When he got out of 
the vehicle, he started to lose his balance. Applicant told the police he was intoxicated. He pled guilty to the offense of public intoxication, a misdemeanor. Ex. 
7.</P> 
<P>In May 1999, Applicant was arrested for assault. Applicant was living with a woman who was eight months pregnant. When he arrived home drunk and started 
to argue with her, she threatened to move out of the apartment. Applicant pushed her over the couch and slapped her twice across the face. He then wrestled her 
to the ground and began to strangle her. Applicant pled guilty to the lesser offense of disorderly conduct. He was sentenced to jail for 30 days, suspended, 
placed on probation for one year, and ordered to attend anger management classes. Ex.6</P> 
<P>In February 2001, Applicant went to visit his daughter at her mother's residence. Applicant was drunk and his daughter's mother asked him to leave. He 
refused, choked her, then picked up the chair on which she was sitting and threw it into the wall and another chair causing her to fall to the floor. The charge 
was dismissed on motion of the prosecution after the alleged victim failed to appear at the hearing. Ex. 5 at 2, 5, 10.</P> 
<P>In March 2001, Applicant was driving his automobile after consuming alcoholic beverages in celebration of St. Patrick's Day. He realized he had consumed too 
much and should not be driving. He pulled his car off the highway to sleep. He failed to remove his keys from the ignition and was arrested and charged with 
DUI. His Breathalyzer revealed a concentration of 0.20%. He pled guilty, paid a fine of $1,400, was placed on probation, and was ordered to perform 
community service and attend alcohol awareness counseling. Ex. 11 at 2; Ex. 13 at 1. The court also ordered that an ignition interlock device be installed on his 
vehicle for one year. Ex. 3 at 8.</P> 
<P>Applicant entered an Alcohol and Drug Abuse Training Program (ADAPT) in June 2001 as a result of his March 2001 DUI. He received a diagnosis of alcohol 
abuse and was suspected of being alcohol dependent. He admitted being intoxicated three times in the previous six months, binge drinking while overseas, and 
reporting for duty intoxicated while he was overseas. As a result of the diagnosis, Applicant was referred to a 16-hour advanced education program to satisfy 
the state requirements for persons convicted of DUI, and was also referred for formal treatment. Applicant completed the 16-hour education program, but 
dropped out of the treatment program after one session. Ex. 13 at 1; Ex. 10 at 2. </P> 
<P>DOHA referred Applicant for a mental health evaluation to determine the extent of his alcohol problem. In an evaluation dated 30 April 2004, he was diagnosed 
with alcohol abuse by a clinical psychologist. The psychologist suspected Applicant was also alcohol dependent. Ex. 13 at 1. Applicant denied he had an 
alcohol problem or is in need of treatment, although he admitted he continued to drink alcohol daily. The psychologist evaluated Applicant as having a 
"guarded" prognosis and strongly urged him to seek treatment. Applicant declined treatment. Ex. 13.</P> 
<P>Applicant still consumes alcoholic beverages. At the hearing, he estimated that he still drinks to the point of intoxication every other weekend. Tr. 38. He 
passed out from drinking alcohol just three weeks before the hearing. Tr. 39. Applicant believes he has "a mild addiction to alcohol." Tr. 42.</P> 
<P>On 20 February 2003, Applicant signed a security clearance application (SCA) certifying that his answers were "true, complete, and correct" to the best of his 
knowledge and belief, and acknowledging that "a knowing and willful false statement" could be punished under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. Question 24 asked if he had 
ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol. Applicant answered "yes," but listed only his most recent DUI from March 2001. Ex. 1.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was convicted of a 24 March 2001 DUI (&para; 1.a), was arrested in February 2001 for domestic violence and simple assault 
(&para; 1.b), was arrested for spouse abuse in May 1999 and pled guilty to disorderly conduct (&para; 1.c), was arrested in August 1997 for intoxication and pled guilty (&para; 
1.d), was arrested twice within a week in March 1995 for DUI (&para; 1.e), was arrested in January 1993 for sexual abuse of a child (&para; 1.f), was arrested in October 
1991 for domestic assault (&para; 1.g), was arrested at a military installation in Germany in 1987 for DWI (&para; 1.h), was arrested for DWI in 1997 (&para; 1.i), and was 
arrested for being drunk/disorderly in 1975 (&para; 1.j).  Applicant admitted &para;&para; 1.a, 1.e, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j, and denied the rest.  A history or pattern of criminal activity 
creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.A </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was charged with sexual abuse of a child. <EM>See</EM> SOR &para; 1.f. There is no evidence, other than the arrest, that he actually committed the offense. There is 
no requirement that an applicant even be charged with a criminal offense for his conduct to be disqualifying. Nevertheless, there must be sufficient evidence of 
record to convince the judge Applicant committed the offense. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 01-12452 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 2003). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence of record does not 
convince me Applicant committed the offense.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence is sufficient to establish each of the other allegations contained in SOR &para; 1. There are allegations, admissions, and convictions of criminal 
conduct. DC E2.A10.1.2.1, E2.A10.1.2.2. An applicant may mitigate such criminal conduct by showing his criminal behavior was not recent. MC 
E2.A10.1.3.1. The last criminal behavior established by the record occurred more than four years ago. Therefore, I conclude MC E2.A10.1.3.1 applies. 
Nevertheless, I find against Applicant on all allegations in SOR &para; 1, except &para; 1.f. Applicant's lengthy record of criminal behavior fueled by alcohol, his failure 
to recognize he has a problem, his continuing to drink to the point of intoxication every two weeks, and his refusal to submit to treatment are cause of great 
concern. Security clearance decisions are predictive judgments based on an applicant's past conduct and present circumstances. ISCR Case No. 02-22240, 2004 
WL 2152736 (App. Bd. Jul. 16, 2004). If he had obtained such treatment and had not been involved in criminal behavior in four years, I could find Applicant 
had presented clear evidence of rehabilitation. Under the current circumstances, I am unable to do so.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G-Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol abuse in April 2004 (&para; 2.a), was diagnosed with alcohol abuse in August 2001 (&para; 2.b), 
consumes five to six beers daily and 12 beers on weekends (&para; 2.c), and his alcohol-related arrests as specified in &para; 1 (&para; 2.d). Applicant denied all of the 
allegations. Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk 
of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. Directive &para; E2.A7.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government produced evidence of potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline G. Applicant was involved in alcohol-related incidents away from 
work-including five driving offenses and several assaults. DC E2.A7.1.2.1. On at least two occasions, Applicant has been diagnosed with alcohol abuse by 
medical professionals who were unable to rule out that he was alcohol dependent. DC E2.A7.1.2.3. Yet he continues to consume alcohol to the point of 
intoxication. He habitually (every two weeks) consumes alcohol to the point of intoxication. DC E2.A7.1.2.5. Applicant believes a person's drinking habits are 
private. He fails to understand that a person who is intoxicated has impaired judgment that increases the risk of a careless unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information. None of the listed mitigating conditions apply. I find against Applicant on &para; 2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified material information on his SCA by deliberately failing to disclose he had been charged with alcohol-related 
offenses as specified in &para;&para; 1.d, 1.e, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j. &para; 3.a. Applicant denied the allegation. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate the applicant may not properly safeguard 
classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established that Applicant failed to list the alcohol-related offenses of which he was charged as alleged in &para;&para; 1.d, 1.e, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j. At the 
hearing, he claimed he thought the question only asked for charges in the last seven years, he thought one of the allegations with which he was charged was 
"bogus," all of the incidents in which he was charged are on file with the military, so an investigator could go there to find it, and he viewed the SCA as another 
job application and "the fewer people that's privy to my past the better as far as I'm concerned." Tr. 48-50. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant's history of alcohol related charges and 
convictions is relevant and material to a determination of his security worthiness. After observing Applicant's demeanor and listening carefully to his testimony, 
I find Applicant deliberately falsified his SCA.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
