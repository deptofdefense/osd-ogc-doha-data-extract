<P>In a Security Clearance Application (SCA) supplied to the Government, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">this thirty year old Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> provided false and incomplete information</SPAN> by not 
admitting that he used cocaine and by greatly minimizing  his usage of marijuana. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He also committed criminal </SPAN>conduct by striking and seriously injuring his 
wife.  Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 15,  2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued an SOR to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons under Guideline H 
(Drug Involvement), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding 
under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted or denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated November 4, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He requested that his case be decided on a hearing 
record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 2, 2004, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to 
the parties on February 13, 2004, and the hearing was held on March 16, 2004. </SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1 through 4), and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered 
two documentary exhibits (Applicant Exhibits A and B), and offered his own testimony. All of the documents were entered into evidence without objection. 
The revised and corrected transcript (TR) was received on March 31, 2004. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the SOR. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The SOR contains four allegations, 1.a. 
through 1.d., under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), two allegations, 2.a. and 2.b., under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and two allegation, 3.a. and 3.b., 
under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a. through 1.d., 2.and 2.b., and he denied 3.a. and 3.b. The admitted allegations 
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and the testimony of 
Applicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is 30 years old. He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense 
sector.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is married and has two sons.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">has abused illegal substances. Applicant testified that he first 
experimented with  marijuana in 1984, when he was 11 years of age. He estimated that he started using marijuana regularly in 1991, and he continued using it 
approximately 60 times a year until 1999, when he stopped his usage (Tr at 29, 30, Exhibit 2).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant purchased marijuana on a monthly basis, during the years he was using it regularly, 1991 through 1999. He denies that he ever sold it (Exhibit 2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also ingested cocaine at least 24 times from approximately 1991 to 1996 (Tr at 30, 31, Exhibit 2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also purchased the cocaine that he used, paying approximately $100, one or two times a year for the period of his usage, from 1991through 1996. He 
denies that he ever sold cocaine. He also denies the usage, purchase, or sale of any other illegal substance (Exhibit 2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he comited two criminal acts. On December 17, 1999, Applicant 
was involved in a physical altercation with his wife, wherein he struck her multiple times, resulting in serious physical injury to her.  Applicant pled guilty to 
Domestic Violence and Harassment, and he was placed on 12 months probation. He was also ordered to undergo 36 weeks of counseling (Exhibits 1 and 2).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1992, Applicant was charged with Driving While Ability Impaired. He was ordered to attend alcohol abuse classes (Exhibits 1 and 2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Paragraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he furnished untruthful information to the Government.  Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
completed a signed, sworn Security Clearance Application (SCA) on May 23, 2002. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 27 of the SCA asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant 
had used illegal drugs, including marijuana, etc. Applicant answered "yes" and responded, that between September 1991 and December 1999, he had used 
marijuana 60 times.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant did not list his use of cocaine </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">(Exhibit 1).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His answer to the question in the SCA generated an interview with a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent. In a signed, sworn statement Applicant provided to 
the DSS agent, he admitted his more extensive use of marijuana and that he had used cocaine, as described above.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><EM></EM></P> 
 
<P>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</P> 
 
<P>a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P> 
 
<P>c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>e. The voluntariness of participation</P> 
 
<P>f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</P> 
 
<P>g. The motivation for the conduct</P> 
 
<P>h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P> 
 
<P>i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </P> 
 
<P>The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly<STRONG> </STRONG>consistent<STRONG> </STRONG>with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day. The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and conduct that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</P> 
 
<P>The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future." The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this 
order...shall be</P> 
 
<P>a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegation set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between Applicant's conduct and 
the continued holding of a security clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM></EM> case. Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) </STRONG></SPAN>With respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case. Applicant's improper and illegal drug 
abuse, including the purchase, possession, and use of marijuana, is of concern, especially in light of his desire to have access to the nation's secrets. Applicant's 
overall conduct pertaining to his illegal substance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A8.1.2.1. (<EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">any drug abuse</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">), and 
DC E2.A8.1.2.2. (</SPAN><EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Based on the fact that Applicant last used cocaine in 1996 and  marijuana in December 1999, I conclude that Applicant's conduct comes within Mitigating 
Condition (MC) E2.A8.1.3.1., (the drug involvement was not recent)." MC E2.A8.1.3.3. also applies because of Applicant's stated intention not to continue 
using marijuana or cocaine in the future. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that Applicant has used illegal drugs for many years under Guideline 
H. Applicant, on the other hand, has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's 
case against him.  Accordingly, Paragraph 1 Guideline H of the SOR is concluded for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)</STRONG> Regarding Guideline J, the Government has established Applicant's criminal conduct. Applicant's physical 
altercation with his wife in 1999 was extremely serious and severe. </SPAN>Applicant's criminal conduct falls within Criminal Conduct DC  E2.A10.1.2.1. and <EM></EM>DC 
E2.A10.1.2.2.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, because the violence perpetrated on Applicant's wife by him involved serious criminal conduct, for which he pled guilty. Based on the egregious 
conduct involved, I cannot conclude that any MC applies.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Paragraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) </STRONG> With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided less than complete information 
to the Government in response to  question,  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">#27,</SPAN> on the SCA that he executed on May 2002.  Based on the admitted evidence, I conclude that when Applicant 
answered the SCA, he knowingly provide untruthful information by his failure to list his usage of cocaine and the full extent of his marijuana usage.</P> 
 
<P>In reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.3.</SPAN> applies<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> because </SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> deliberately provided false and  misleading information in 
his SCA.</SPAN> No MC applies in this paragraph. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>Applicant's conduct, considered as a whole, including his drug history, his criminal conduct, and the 
misinformation that he provided to the Government, exhibits questionable judgement, unreliability, and a lack of candor. I resolve <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 3 </SPAN>Guideline E 
against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance.</SPAN></P>
