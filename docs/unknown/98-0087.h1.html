<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></U></P>

<P>On January 27, 1998, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>"Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,"</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>"Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program"</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified,
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P>

<P>In a sworn written statement, dated February 6, 1998, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have her case decided on a written record, in lieu of a hearing.
Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on February 24, 1998.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="98-0087.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> was provided to Applicant, and she was afforded an
opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  She submitted a response, dated February 26, 1998.  The case was initially assigned to Administrative Judge
Roger C. Wesley on March 27, 1998, but due to caseload considerations, was subsequently reassigned to, and received by, this Administrative Judge on April 2, 1998.</P>

<P><STRONG><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></STRONG></P>

<P>Applicant has admitted all of the factual allegations pertaining to drug involvement under Criterion H.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.</P>

<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P>

<P>Applicant is a twenty-two year old female employed by a defense contractor, and she is seeking to obtain a TOP SECRET security clearance.</P>

<P>Applicant was an illegal poly-substance abuser.  She commenced using marijuana in about December 1993,<A HREF="98-0087.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> when she was 18 years of age, while in college, initially out of "youthful curiosity" and due
to peer pressure,<A HREF="98-0087.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> and continued doing so, on a regular basis, until at least November 1996. During the period 1993-95, she abused marijuana up to two times per week; and in 1996, the frequency
increased to daily abuse.<A HREF="98-0087.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>  She smoked it primarily in social situations, and estimated that she had used marijuana on about 100-150 occasions.<A HREF="98-0087.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A></P>

<P>Applicant ceased using marijuana when she decided she didn't like it any more.<A HREF="98-0087.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A>  Her cessation of marijuana abuse had nothing to do with abstinence, because she had found a substitute illegal
substance, and had already commenced abusing cocaine.  There is, however, nothing in the record to rebut Applicant's contention that she has abstained from marijuana abuse since November 1996.</P>

<P>Applicant commenced using cocaine in approximately May 1996, initially after being introduced to it by her boss, and continued doing so, on a regular basis, until at least January 1997.<A HREF="98-0087.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A> Initially, she
abused cocaine only a few times per month, but by November 1996, the frequency had increased to regular daily abuse.<A HREF="98-0087.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A>  She abused cocaine primarily by herself, and estimated that she had done so on
about 15-20 occasions.<A HREF="98-0087.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A>  Applicant eventually realized that she had a cocaine "problem," and terminated her employment and ceased abusing cocaine.  There is nothing in the record to rebut Applicant's
contention that she has abstained from cocaine abuse since January 1997.</P>

<P>During the period of her greatest cocaine abuse, on one occasion, when encouraged to do so by her boss, Applicant purchased an unspecified quantity of cocaine.<A HREF="98-0087.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP>(10)</SUP></A>  There is nothing in the record to
rebut Applicant's contention that she had made only one such purchase.</P>

<P>February 1994 was a time for experimentation by Applicant.  On one occasion, with a friend in a college dormitory room, out of curiosity, Applicant experimented with an amphetamine, referred to as a
"white cross."<A HREF="98-0087.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP>(11)</SUP></A>  That same month, on two separate occasions, also in a college dormitory room, out of curiosity and due to peer pressure, Applicant experimented with Lysergic Acid Diethylamide
(LSD), referred to as "acid."<A HREF="98-0087.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP>(12)</SUP></A>  There is nothing in the record to rebut Applicant's contentions that she has abstained from both amphetamine and LSD abuse since February 1994.</P>

<P>Applicant has vowed to never use illegal substances in the future,<A HREF="98-0087.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP>(13)</SUP></A> and contends that she has turned her life around and become more active in positive endeavors.  She attributes her poly-substance
abuse to the "mistakes of an insecure, misguided girl with little or no long-range goals for her life."<A HREF="98-0087.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP>(14)</SUP></A></P>

<P>Applicant has never undergone any drug treatment or rehabilitation.<A HREF="98-0087.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP>(15)</SUP></A></P>

<P>Applicant has been employed by her current employer since April 1997.  Corporate officers and co-workers from her employer have characterized her performance and attitude in positive terms, and
they, along with friends, support her application.</P>

<P><STRONG><U>POLICIES</U></STRONG></P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the
adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Factors) and
those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Factors).</P>

<P>An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when applied in
conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision--an expansion of the factors set forth in Section F.3. of the Directive, are intended to assist the Administrative Judge in
reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P>

<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and
unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an Administrative Judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the
conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P>

<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P>

<P><STRONG>[Drug Involvement - Criterion H]: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse
or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</STRONG></P>

<P>Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering:</P>

<P>(a) drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and
hallucinogens) and</P>

<P>(b) inhalants and other similar substances.</P>

<P>Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P>

<P>(1) any drug abuse (see above definition);</P>

<P>(2) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution;</P>

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P>

<P>(3) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.</P>

<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount determinant, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly
consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="98-0087.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP>(16)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest." For the purposes herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded that both standards
are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have endeavored to draw only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have
attempted to avoid drawing inferences that are grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the Government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the Government meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant
to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty hours
and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it
grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or
safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's loyalty and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that industrial security
clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many
characteristics of an applicant other than loyalty and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied
decision as to Applicant's loyalty or patriotism.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT SIZE="-1">CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts and factors, including those described briefly above, I
conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">With respect to Criterion H, the Government has established its case.  Applicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, including the possession and use of marijuana, cocaine, amphetamine, and LSD, and
her one-time purchase of cocaine, is of concern, especially in light of her desire to have access to the nation's secrets.  With regard to the marijuana and cocaine, Applicant did not simply experiment out
of curiosity and stop.  Instead, motivated by social pleasures, notwithstanding the legal status of her endeavor (it was illegal), she exhibited a pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, and
immature behavior, and continued her regular abuse of marijuana for nearly three years; and her regular abuse of cocaine for eight months.  The marijuana abuse finally ceased about 16 months before
the closing of the record; and the cocaine abuse ceased about 14 months before the closing of the record.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes are significant factors in the overall adjudicative process.  Despite a period of marijuana and cocaine abuse, Applicant
has not undergone any drug awareness, education, or treatment program, in order to achieve a better self-understanding of the behavioral and psychological effects of her actions and the motivation
therefor.  Likewise, simply superficially claiming that peer pressure, curiosity, immaturity, and continued social pleasures were motivators, does not demonstrate true insight into the actual motivation
for following the course of conduct which she had chosen.  Without the development of countermeasures to the resumption of substance abuse--relapse prevention, the likelihood of recurrence becomes
greater.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Applicant's continuing abstinence is to be encouraged, but the current period of abstinence is still relatively brief, too brief, in light of her substance abuse history.  In this instance, I believe that both the
successful completion of a drug treatment and rehabilitation program, as well as a longer period of abstinence should be required to demonstrate the truly successful transformation from substance
abuser to an abstinent, drug-free person, and to provide the basis for a conclusion that such conduct will not continue or recur in the future.  Under the evidence presented, I am not confident that
Applicant's substance abuse is a thing of the past, or that it will not recur.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">I do not take this position lightly, but based on the law, as set forth in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan,</EM> 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my evaluation of the evidence, and my application of the pertinent factors under
the Adjudicative Process, I believe that Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the Government's case.  The evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant's continued security
eligibility and suitability.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.c. of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Applicant's experimentation with amphetamine on one occasion in February 1994, and LSD on two occasions that same month, has not been repeated thereafter, and I consider such abuse to be stale,
with little current security significance.  Thus, I conclude that Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the Government's case. Accordingly,
allegations 1.d. and 1.e. of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not suitable for access to classified information.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT SIZE="-1">FORMAL FINDINGS</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Paragraph 1. Criterion H:   AGAINST THE APPLICANT</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Subparagraph 1.a.:  Against the Applicant</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Subparagraph 1.b.:  Against the Applicant</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Subparagraph 1.c.:  Against the Applicant</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Subparagraph 1.d.:  For the Applicant</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Subparagraph 1.e.:  For the Applicant</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT SIZE="-1">DECISION</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</FONT></P>
