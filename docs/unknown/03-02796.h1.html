<P>Applicant was convicted of 2<SUP>nd</SUP> Degree Arson on November 6, 1972 and sentenced to ten years in prison. He was seventeen years old when he committed the 
offense, and nineteen years old when he was paroled on June 18, 1974. He has now been married for twenty-six years, has been continuously gainfully 
employed since being paroled, and has no subsequent criminal history. Because of the statutory disqualification imposed by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, he is unable to 
mitigate the security concern his criminal conduct has created. Clearance is denied. I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On October 9, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-02796.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges a security concern under Guideline J for criminal conduct. The SOR also alleges that 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 disqualifies Applicant from having a security 
clearance granted or renewed. Applicant submitted a sworn answer to the SOR that was received by DOHA on December 1, 2003, admitted he was convicted of 
2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>nd</SUP> Degree Arson, and requested a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">This case was assigned to me on January 12, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on January 13, 2004, scheduling the hearing for February 6, 2004. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled.  The government submitted two documentary exhibits at the hearing that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-2 
and admitted into the record without an objection.  The Applicant testified at the hearing, called his wife as a witness on his behalf, and submitted twelve 
documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-12 and admitted into the record without an objection.  The transcript was received on 
February 18, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admission to the allegation in the SOR is incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make 
the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 49-year-old man who has been self-employed as an owner-operator of a tractor-trailer since approximately 1980. He is presently seeking to 
obtain a security clearance to enable him to haul sensitive material, apparently pursuant to defense department contracts, for a company to which he leases his 
equipment. He submitted letters of recommendation and certificates attesting to his being a skilled driver and an honest, hardworking, and trustworthy 
individual. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Sometime in 1972, Applicant broke into a house trailer with two other youths and stole several items, including a motorcycle, from therein. They returned the 
motorcycle to the premises, but then set fire to the trailer in an effort to conceal their crimes. The trailer was completely destroyed. Applicant was 17 years old 
at the time of these offenses, and considered a minor under the applicable state law. The juvenile court declined to exercise jurisdiction over his case, resulting 
him being prosecuted as an adult. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was charged with the offenses of 2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>nd</SUP> Degree Burglary, 2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>nd</SUP> Degree Arson, and Larceny. He entered a plea of guilty to the 2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>nd</SUP> Degree Arson charge on 
November 6, 1972, and was sentenced to serve ten years in prison on January 31, 1973. He was paroled to a halfway house on June 18, 1974, released from the 
halfway house sometime in approximately 1975, and was released from parole and had his rights restored on May 10, 1977. Applicant was 19 years old at the 
time he was paroled.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admitted at the hearing that he had broken into another house when he was approximately 13 years old, although he was never arrested for that 
offense. He did not steal anything from that residence. He also admitted at the hearing that he had committed a shoplifting offense when he was approximately 
eight years old, although again he was never arrested for that offense. Applicant has no criminal history subsequent to his incarceration in 1972, with the 
exception of minor traffic offenses.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant obtained his high school diploma while in prison. He met his wife while he was a halfway house resident when he attended Bible study classes that 
she and her family also attended. They have been married since October 1977, have no children, and own their own home. Applicant's wife is also a truck 
driver, and they operate the family trucking business together. She will act as the required second driver when Applicant hauls classified loads. Applicant held a 
variety of jobs from the time he was paroled until he began his own trucking business.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline J, 
pertaining to criminal conduct, with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-02796.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-02796.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="03-02796.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="03-02796.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-02796.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-02796.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-02796.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-02796.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-02796.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="03-02796.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case against Applicant under Guideline J. The evidence establishes he was convicted of 2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>nd</SUP> Degree Arson in 1972 and 
sentenced to imprisonment for a term of ten years. He actually served more than eighteen months prior to being paroled to a halfway house. Disqualifying 
Conditions (DC) 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>; and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a crime 
and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year </EM>apply in this case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Other than the arson conviction and two prior offenses committed when he was a tender age child, Applicant has led a law-abiding life. He has no criminal 
history subsequent to his release from prison in 1974. The character letters he submitted attest to his honesty, integrity and  competency as a driver. I find that 
itigating Conditions (MC) 1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>: The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>; and MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation </EM>apply in this case. 
However, because of the statutory disqualification imposed by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, Applicant is unable to mitigate his criminal conduct.  Guideline J is decided 
against Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of the disqualification mandated by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. </SPAN></P>
