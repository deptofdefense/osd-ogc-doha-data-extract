<P>Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns over foreign preference prompted by his dual citizenship: after he became a naturalized US citizen in 
August 1985, he possessed a foreign passport  and used this foreign passport for trips to Iran in 1994 and 1998.  He has not relinquished the  
foreign passport which expires in October 2001 and has not acted to document his exclusive preference for the US.  (The fact that the government 
of Iran does not allow people born in Iran to travel to Iran with a US passport does not  mitigate the use of a foreign passport under current US 
security policy.)  While his parents and siblings are citizens of this foreign country and reside there, the ties are so casual and infrequent that he 
would not be subject to foreign influence.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Government could not reach the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant,<A HREF="00-0486.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> so the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on 
September 11, 2000.  The SOR detailed security concerns in paragraph 1 over foreign preference (Guideline C) and in paragraph 2 over foreign 
influence (Guideline B).  Applicant received the SOR and replied to these SOR allegations in an Answer of October 20, 2000, and admitted 
allegations 1.a. through 1.c. with explanations and  2.a.  He requested a decision on the record as he did not wish to have a hearing. </P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel; on November 17, 2000, she prepared the File of Relevant Material (FORM) for the Applicant's 
review.  Department Counsel advised Applicant that he had 30 days to submit objections and/or information before the FORM was submitted to 
an administrative judge and that he had the right to be represented by counsel.  A Personnel Security Specialist (PSS) sent the FORM to 
Applicant on November 22, 2000, and again notified the Applicant that he had 30 days from receipt of the letter to submit objections and/or 
information before the FORM was submitted to an administrative judge. Applicant  received the FORM on December 7, 2000.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, he did 
not submit any response before the deadline of January 7, 2001.  On July 10, 2001, the case was assigned to me.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On July 25, 2001, Department Counsel sent me and Applicant a letter noting that she had inadvertently omitted from the file, the DOHA letter of 
September 11, 2000, which transmitted the SOR and noted as an attachment 3, The Department of Defense ASD(C3I)  policy memorandum on 
August 16, 2000, which clarified the policy on Foreign Preference, Guideline C.  He received this attachment on September 18, 2000.  (Item 6)  </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Clarification</STRONG> <STRONG>of Department of Defense Policy on Foreign Preference</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Department of Defense policy memorandum of August 16, 2000, clarified the policy on Foreign Preference, Guideline C and stated, in part:</P> 
 
<P>The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify the application of Guideline C to cases involving an applicant's possession or use of a foreign 
passport.  The Guideline specifically provides that "possession and/or use of a foreign passport" may be a disqualifying condition.  It contains no 
mitigating factor related to the applicant's personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country.  The only 
applicable mitigation factor addresses the official approval of the United States Government for the possession or use.  The security concerns 
underlying this guideline are that possession and use of a foreign passport in preference to a U.S. passport raises doubt as to whether the person's 
allegiance to the United States is paramount and it could also facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by the United States.  Therefore, consistent 
application of the guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official 
approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United State Government.  Modification of the Guideline is not required.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of 
Fact:</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, 40 years old, is a professional with a United States (US) defense contractor  (Company #1) in State #1.  He has worked there since 
December 1994.  Prior to that he worked for other companies.  In July 1999 he completed an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Security 
Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) (SF 86) to seek a Secret security clearance.  (Item 4)  Applicant had been granted a Secret level 
security clearance in 1988.  (Items 4, 5)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant received a masters degree in January 1983 from a university in State #3.  Applicant  married a US citizen in 1981 in State #3. (Item 4) </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Foreign Preference</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Born in Iran in 1959, Applicant immigrated to the US in 1976 to attend college in State #3 on a student visa with his Iranian passport which he still 
holds.  After completing his master's degree, he worked for Company #5 from 1983-86 and for Company #4 from 1986 to 1987.  He  worked 
for Company #3 from 1987 to 1989 and held a DoD secret clearance.  From 1989 to 1994 he worked for Company #2 in State #2 and has 
worked for Company #1 since 1994.  Thus, he has lived, studied, and worked continuously in the US since November 1976.  (Items 4, 5)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant became a naturalized US citizen in August 1985, and is a dual<A HREF="00-0486.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> citizen of the US and Iran.   While his US passport was issued to him 
initially in 1986 and renewed in June 1998, he used an Iranian passport to travel to Iran under that foreign passport re-issued in October 1996 
which does not expire until October 2001.  Applicant visited Iran for a one month period of time in 1977, 1994 and 1998.  This travel was on his 
foreign passport as the government of Iran does not allow people born in Iran to travel to Iran with a US passport.  For him to enter Iran on his 
US passport he would have to give up his Iranian citizenship and serve two years in the Iranian Army. He has never served in the Iranian military 
and has not registered with the Iranian miliary.  He would not serve in the Iranian military or bear arms on behalf of the Iranian Government.  He 
has no intention of exercising or accepting any rights, privileges or benefits offered by Iran to its citizens.  He has never registered to obtain 
benefits.  His only reason for travel to Iran is to visit his family as he has no financial interests there.  (Items 4, 5)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has never been employed as an agent or official representative of a foreign government and does not seek or hold a political office in a 
foreign state.  He has not used his position of trust and responsibility to influence decisions to serve the interests of another government in 
preference to those of the US.  (Items 4, 5)   </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's parents and siblings live in Iran, but do not hold any type of government position there.  His father is a retired poultry farmer and store 
owner.  Applicant does not receive any type of financial support from Iran or from any family members living in Iran; he does not send any financial 
support to family members in Iran.  He credibly maintains he would not be subject to blackmail, pressure or coercion by a foreign government 
because of his family living in Iran.  He has never had any suspicious approaches or contacts; and if any were to recur, he would immediately 
report them appropriately. Applicant visited Iran intermittently in 1977, 1994 and 1998; and his family has visited him in the US.  (Items 4, 5)   </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into 
conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to 
grant or continue an individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is 
not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth 
below:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Guideline C - Foreign Preference</STRONG><A HREF="00-0486.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>The Concern:  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he

<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include</STRONG>:</P> 
 
<P>(1)  the exercise of dual citizenship; </P> 
 
<P>(2)  possession and/or use of a foreign passport<A HREF="00-0486.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>; </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>None</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <STRONG>B - Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>The concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he 
or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2)  may be subject to duress.  
These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  
Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they 
make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1)  an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present 
in, a foreign country</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1)   a determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in 
question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose 
between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3)  contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order</P> 
 
<P> to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue the clearance.  Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an 
applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching 
the fair and impartial overall common sense determination, the Administrative Judge may only draw those inferences and conclusions that have a 
reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></SPAN><STRONG>Guideline<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> C - Foreign Preference     </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government raises a security concern under Guideline C, Foreign Preference when an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference 
for a foreign country over the United States: the individual may then be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the 
interests of the US.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:  (1)  the exercise of dual citizenship; (2)  
possession and/or use of a foreign passport.  Security concerns over Applicant's possible foreign preference arise from his exercise of dual 
citizenship:  he has held a foreign passport issued after he became a naturalized citizen of the US in August 1985 and after his US passport was 
issued to him in 1986.  </P> 
 
<P>While dual citizenship is not prohibited <EM>per se </EM>(and in that sense is sanctioned by policies of the United States), any conduct indicating possible 
foreign preference does raise a security concern where such action would increase the risk of an individual being influenced by the needs, desires, 
or aims of a foreign nation.  Not only did he possess a foreign passport, he chose to use it for two trips in 1994 and 1998 after he was a 
naturalized US citizen and was issued a US passport.</P> 
 
<P>The clarification in DoD security policy on August 16, 2000, focused on foreign passports:  The Guideline specifically provided that "possession 
and/or use of a foreign passport" may be a disqualifying<A HREF="00-0486.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> condition. But the policy guidance furnished a means for individuals to mitigate this 
concern: the only clear requirement is that an applicant must surrender the foreign passport or obtain official approval for its use from the 
appropriate agency of the United States Government.  Applicant did not do so.  Even after he was advised of these security requirements with his 
SOR and with the FORM, Applicant's attitude and conduct did not change:  Applicant has not surrendered his foreign passport to comply with 
these US security requirements.  </P> 
 
<P>Significantly, neither did he take the additional step of renouncing his foreign citizenship even though he claimed to consider himself only a US 
citizen.  Thus, Applicant has not complied with the DoD August 2000 policy clarification requirements, and he has not mitigated<A HREF="00-0486.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> those foreign 
preference concern.   While the policy does not mandate renouncing foreign citizenship in order to gain access to classified information,<A HREF="00-0486.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Applicant 
has not even indicated his conditional willingness to renounce foreign citizenship or surrender his passport.  While he has lived in the US for a long 
period of time since immigrating here, he has roots and family in Iran and has used his Iranian passport to visit there after becoming a naturalized 
US citizen and being granted a US passport.  Looking at the totality of his conduct and circumstances, I note that he has not clearly demonstrated 
that his principal preference has been to the US and would continue to be to the US.   Further, he provided no references that he has handled his 
security requirements professionally in the past and is trustworthy for a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Acts indicative of foreign preference warrant careful scrutiny.  Security concerns over his dual citizenship remain as there is no substantial evidence 
of any affirmative actions to surrender his foreign passport as required to indicate his clear preference for the United States.  His repeated use of 
his Iranian passport to visit Iran in 1994 and 1998 undercuts his statement that he considers himself only a US citizen.  He has taken no steps to 
indicate that exclusive preference.  Applicant does not claim that his activities were sanctioned by the US.  The fact that the government of Iran 
does not allow people born in Iran to travel to Iran with a US passport is not a basis to mitigate the use of a foreign passport under current US 
security policy as the DOHA Appeal Board has noted that current policy rejects the argument of legal necessity.<A HREF="00-0486.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  When pressed to make a 
choice, an individual may chose his birthplace over his adopted country of economic opportunity.  As security clearance decisions are predictive 
judgments about an applicant's security eligibility in light of the applicant's past conduct and present circumstances, any doubt must be resolved 
against Applicant.  <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).  </P> 
 
<P>Thus, in this case, I conclude after reviewing all of the evidence in the record and considering all of the policies and the August 16, 2000, policy 
clarification memorandum that there does remain  concern under current policy that Applicant could act in preference for that foreign country over 
the United States.  After considering the Enclosure 2 Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines as well as the August 2000 
DoD policy clarification, I resolve SOR paragraph 1 and subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c. against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence</STRONG>     </CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government expressed security concerns over Applicant's possible foreign influence raised by his close ties of affection to citizens of a foreign 
country:  his parents and  his siblings are citizens of a foreign country.  The security concern under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, is that a security 
risk may exist when an individual's immediate family. . . and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation 
are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2)  may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that 
could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Conditions that could 
raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:  (1)  an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of 
affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country. While the foreign influence provisions of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines are neutral as to the nature of the subject country, in this case, the country of Applicant's heritage has a history of hostage taking and the 
potential for exerting pressure or influence against the US.  </P> 
 
<P>While the Government documented no specific evidentiary basis for any specific security concern other than his 1994 and 1998 visits to his family, 
the burden is on Applicant to establish there is no basis for a security concern.  He asserts that the family has no ties to the government and that his 
father is a retired poultry farmer and store owner.  Applicant does not receive any type of financial support from Iran or from any family members 
living in Iran; nor does he send any financial support to family members in Iran.  He credibly maintains he would not be subject to blackmail, 
pressure or coercion by a foreign government because of his family living in Iran.  He has never had any suspicious approaches or contacts; and if 
any were to recur, he would immediately report them appropriately. </P> 
 
<P>Thus, these security concerns are mitigated by the fact that Applicant's relatives have no ties to their foreign government, and there is little 
likelihood that they would exercise foreign influence over Applicant merely because of these family ties.  Applicant does not visit them frequently; 
he has not been there in three years.  Thus, I conclude that Applicant's ties are casual and infrequent.  Since he has been a US citizen for sixteen 
years, I think it improbable that his family would now create a situation that could result in the compromise of classified information or subject 
Applicant to duress. Contacts with citizens of other countries are relevant to security determinations only if they make an individual potentially 
vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure through threats against those foreign relatives.  </P> 
 
<P>While acts indicative of foreign influence warrant careful scrutiny, after considering the Enclosure 2 Adjudicative Process factors and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines, here I conclude these family ties do not raise such concerns.  Thus, I resolve SOR paragraph 2 and subparagraph 2.a. in 
Applicant's favor.</P>
