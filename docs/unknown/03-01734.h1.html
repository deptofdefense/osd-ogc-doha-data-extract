<P>Applicant's long history of drug abuse and related criminal conduct has not been mitigated by sufficient evidence of reform and rehabilitation.  He did not 
intend to falsify his security clearance application.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On October 1, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 21, 2003, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to 
the undersigned on February 26, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on March 17, 2004, scheduling the hearing for April 21, 2004.  At the hearing the 
Government presented three exhibits and called one witness.  The Applicant presented four exhibits and testified on his own behalf.   The official transcript 
(Tr.) was received on May 7, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 38 years old, unmarried and holds a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Electronic Engineering Technology.  He is employed by a defense 
contractor as a Aerospace Engineer, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has abused illegal substances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>The Applicant admitted to each of the allegations, set forth in the SOR under this guideline, except allegations 1(g) and 3(a).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant began using marijuana in the summer of 1980 at the young age of fourteen.  He continued to use marijuana throughout high school.  He also used 
other illegal drugs including what he believed to be mushrooms, cocaine and LSD.  As the years passed, the Applicant continued to use marijuana on a daily 
basis.  In 1984, the Applicant joined the Army, and stopped using marijuana for about a two year period.  In 1987, he resumed his use of marijuana about six 
months before he was discharged.  After his military discharge, he continued to use marijuana on a daily basis.  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibit 2).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In late 1993, the Applicant began using methamphetamine (speed).  He continued to use it on a daily basis until March 1994.  He purchased the illegal drugs he 
used from drug dealers.  He also grew a couple of marijuana plants during the summer of 1993 for his personal use.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By 1994, the Applicant realized his use of methamphetamine (speed) was out of control and that he needed to do something about it.  He states that he went to 
the police department, told them that he had a drug problem, and that he needed to get cleaned up.  (Tr. p. 71).  At that time the Applicant was homeless and 
living in his car.  The Applicant was arrested in March 1994, for being Under the Influence of a Controlled Substance.  He was ordered by the court to enter and 
complete a six month drug awareness program and to attend ten Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings.  The Applicant completed the drug program sometime 
in 1995.  Following this program, the Applicant did not use any illegal drugs for about two years.  He then resumed his illegal drug use by using marijuana 
sporadically at times, daily at times, and then, at times, not at all.  The Applicant last used cocaine on New Years Eve 2000.  He also used methamphetamine 
about ten times since completing his drug program  He used cocaine as recently as January 2000, and marijuana as recently as March 2001.  (<EM>See</EM> Government 
Exhibit 2).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant explained that in 1988, not 1998 as alleged by the Government, that there was one occasion where he picked up about two pounds of marijuana 
and transported it to another city for a friend, who was a drug dealer, that he used to socialize with.  The friend gave him a small portion of marijuana in return.  
(Tr. pp. 37-39).  The Applicant contends, however, that he has never been involved in the trafficking of illegal drugs for a profit or gain.  (<EM>See </EM>Applicant's 
Answer to SOR).    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From 1998 until March 2001, while working for a defense contractor, the Applicant has on occasion used marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine (speed).  
He has not used it while at work.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant states that since March 2001, he has turned his life around.  He has a stable relationship with his girlfriend whom he has known for ten years and 
lived with for the past nine years.  He has a young son and wants to set a good example for him.  He states that he no longer uses illegal drugs and has no 
intention of ever using them again in the future.  He avoids associating with any one who uses drugs.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant admitted to each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline.  In June 1987, the Applicant was arrested for Possession of a 
Controlled Substance, Cocaine.  Sentencing was declined in this case. </P> 
 
<P>In March 1994, the Applicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of a Controlled Substance.  This arrest is described in paragraph 1. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material 
aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) dated September 17, 2002.  Question 29, asked him if in the last seven years he 
had been involved in the illegal purchase, manufacture, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving, or sale of any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, 
hallucinogen, or cannabis for his intended profit or that of another.  The Applicant answered "NO".  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 1).  The Government alleges that 
the Applicant intentionally concealed his trafficking of marijuana in 1998.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find that the Applicant did not intentionally falsify this information on his security clearance application.  First, the Applicant did not believe that his conduct 
involved drug trafficking, even  though it appears that it did.  Secondly, the Applicant credibly testified that he mistakenly listed that this incident occurred in 
1998, when it actually occurred in 1988, during the time he lived in another state.  (Tr. pp. 37-39 and 67).  Therefore, this conduct occurred fourteen years 
before completing the security clearance application, not within the last seven years.  Accordingly, I find that the Applicant did not deliberately attempt to 
conceal this information from the Government on his security clearance application.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An affidavit from the Applicant's girlfriend indicates that the Applicant has been drug free for at least three years.  She states that he has consistently proved to 
be a positive influence and a true asset to her life.  She further states that he is a person of high integrity, hardworking, independent and a positive self starter.  
(<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibit C).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's college transcripts indicate an "A" average in all of his courses.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibit A).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An affidavit from a physician who was retained to do an addiction evaluation of the Applicant notes that the Applicant's father was an alcoholic and his mother 
drank a lot.  This provides concern of a possible genetic factor in the potential for addiction.  However, the physician concluded that it was his impression that 
the Applicant is not a chemically dependent person, nor an abuser of legal or illegal drugs or alcohol.  He further states that the Applicant is fully aware of the 
consequences of any use of these substances, and that there has been no progression of his use over the past years and no use or abuse recently.  (<EM>See</EM> 
Applicant's Exhibit D).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in drug abuse and criminal conduct that demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has  engaged in drug abuse (Guideline H) and  criminal conduct (Guideline 
J).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's 
conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case under Guidelines H and J of the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's long history of drug abuse started in 1980, when he was fourteen years old and continued until March 2001, when he was thirty-five.  For 
twenty-one years the Applicant was deeply involved with illegal drugs.  He used them, purchased them from drug dealers, and tried to grow them.  He also 
transported some marijuana from one city to another for a friend who was a drug dealer.  During this twenty-one period the Applicant abused marijuana on a 
daily basis at times, and also experimented with cocaine, LSD, mushrooms and methamphetamine (speed).  After hitting rock bottom in 1994, homeless and 
living in his car, he participated in a court ordered drug awareness program and attended AA meetings.  He was able to remain drug free for two years.  After 
that, however, he relapsed and returned to using marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since March 2001, the Applicant has not used any illegal drugs.  He is commended for his  effort to again turn his life around.  He has now been drug free for 
over three years.  However, given his extensive history of drug abuse and the fact that he has stopped several times in the past and started again after two or so 
years of abstinence, there is no assurance that he will remain drug free for an extended period beyond that.  Therefore, at this time, it is too soon to determine 
that the Applicant will remain drug free once and for all.  More time is needed in rehabilitation in order to ensure that he will not resort to his old habits. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's criminal history involves two drug related arrests, one in 1987, the other in 1994 and many other occasions where he engaged in illegal drug 
use, transportation, or cultivation, but was not arrested.  Taken together, Applicant's criminal conduct establishes that the exercise of poor judgment is not an 
aberration, but has been a basic part of Applicant's character for almost all of his adult life.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person has been formally charged) 
and 2 ( a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) are clearly applicable.  None of the mitigating conditions apply. Although his last arrest occurred in 
1994, about ten years ago, in the context of so many criminal acts over so long a period, there is no substantive indication of a fundamental change in the 
Applicant's thinking process or character.  On this basis, I conclude that the criminal conduct remains current and is clearly not an isolated incident (MC 1, 2).  
There is also some indication of the Applicant's rehabilitation, however, not enough.  Accordingly Guideline J is found against the Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline E, I find that the Applicant did not intend to deliberately conceal  information from the Government in response to question 29 on his 
security clearance application.  Accordingly, this allegation is found for the Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 and 2 of the SOR.   </SPAN></P>
