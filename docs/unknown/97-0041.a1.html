</P>

<P>	Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski issued a decision, dated June 26, 1997, in
which she concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed that adverse decision.  For the reasons set forth
below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's Decision.</P>

<P>	This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P>

<P>	Applicant's appeal presents the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's conclusions were
arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of
Reasons (SOR) dated January 24, 1997.  The SOR was predicated upon Criterion H (Drug
Involvement), Criterion E (Personal Conduct) and Criterion J (Criminal Conduct).  Applicant
submitted a response to the SOR in which he requested a hearing.  A hearing was held on May 22,
1997.  The Administrative Judge issued an unfavorable decision on June 26, 1997.  The case is
before the Board on appeal from that adverse decision.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Applicant does not contest any of the Administrative Judge's specific findings of fact.  He
does contest the Administrative Judge's conclusions with regard to Criterion H (Drug Involvement). 
We construe his appeal as asserting that the Administrative Judge's conclusions were arbitrary,
capricious or contrary to law.</P>

<P>	Applicant argues that his 26-year history of marijuana use has been mitigated by his period 
of abstinence and his current lack of desire to use drugs.  The Judge discussed her analysis and
concerns as to: Applicant's continued association with a drug user, Applicant's lengthy drug-use 
history, Applicant's 14 months of abstinence, and Applicant's desire to maintain defense-related
employment.  While Applicant can and does argue that the Adjudicative Guidelines mitigating
conditions might have been applied differently to the facts in this case, we find no error in the
Administrative Judge's careful consideration of all the pertinent facts as she applied the pertinent
provisions of the Directive to Applicant's case.  </P>

<P>	Applicant discusses at some length issues related to falsification.  Since the Administrative
Judge found for Applicant on the falsification issues, we need not consider those appeal arguments.</P>

<P>	Applicant argues that the significance of a failed March 1996 drug test has been overcome 
by Applicant's more recent negative drug tests.  Since the failed drug test was not the primary
concern of Administrative Judge in making her findings, we find Applicant's arguments unpersuasive
on this point.</P>

<P>	None of the issues raised by Applicant demonstrate error by  the Administrative Judge. 
There is no basis to conclude that the Administrative Judge's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or
contrary to law.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Applicant has failed to meet his burden on appeal of demonstrating error below. 
Accordingly, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>
