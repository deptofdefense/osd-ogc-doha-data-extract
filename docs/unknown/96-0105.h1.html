</P>

<P>	On 19 April 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary
affirmative finding<A HREF="96-0105.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant. On 13 May 1996, Applicant answered the SOR and requested
an administrative decision on the record. Applicant did not respond to the Government's File of
Relevant Material (FORM)--issued 18 June; the record in this case closed 26 July 1996, the day
the response was due at DOHA. I received the case on 21 August 1996 to determine whether
clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</P>

<P>		The SOR is attached to this Decision and incorporated by reference.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Applicant admitted the  allegations of the SOR, except that he denied alcohol abuse after
1991 (subparagraph 2.a.) and denied falsifying his April 1995 sworn statement (subparagraphs
3.a. and 4.b.); accordingly I incorporate the admissions as findings of fact.</P>

<P>	Applicant is a 38-year old employee of a defense contractor seeking a secret clearance.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	Applicant has an extensive and intense history of drug and alcohol abuse. He first tried
cocaine in January 1988, and used it nearly daily until June 1990. During this time, he used
marijuana almost daily as a means of coming down from the cocaine high. He purchased and
sold cocaine to support his habit, in violation of state and federal law (Items 15, 16, 17, 18, 19):
Applicant fronted $600.00 a week to a friend to buy one ounce of cocaine; the friend would sell
one-half ounce of cocaine for $500.00 and then give Applicant the $500.00 and one-half ounce of
cocaine for Applicant's personal use. Between January 1988 and June 1990, Applicant estimates
he fronted $2,440.00 per month for cocaine purchases, and netted $76,000.00. Applicant used the
profits to buy more cocaine for his personal use. He also purchased marijuana for his personal
use, spending about $25.00 a week during the same period he was using cocaine. (FORM, Item
5).</P>

<P>	In June 1988, Applicant attended group therapy three times a week for his drug abuse;
however, he continued to use drugs. On 29 July 1988, Applicant entered inpatient treatment for
chemical dependence, remaining until 8 September 1988. During his stay, he left the hospital
once and used marijuana (FORM Items 9, 10). Although he was discharged from the hospital in
satisfactory condition, the discharge summary reported only moderate commitment to recovery.
Applicant quickly relapsed into alcohol and cocaine abuse. On 4 November 1988, Applicant was
re-admitted to inpatient treatment for chemical dependence and alcohol abuse, and was
discharged 12 November 1988 (Items 11, 12). At the time of his admission to the hospital, he 
reported being fired from his job ten days before admission for failure to follow his aftercare
program. After his release from the hospital<FONT SIZE="-1">,</FONT> he quickly relapsed into cocaine and alcohol abuse;
on 18 November 1988 Applicant was admitted a third time to inpatient treatment for chemical
dependence (mixed cocaine and marijuana) and alcoholism. Applicant was detoxified and began
a full treatment program; however, on 26 November 1988 he left the program against medical
advice. Prognosis: very poor. (Item 13).</P>

<P>	Applicant continued to abuse cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol until June 1990, when he
claims to have stopped without outside assistance. He claims to have remained drug free from
June 1990 to May 1991. From May 1991 to August 1991, Applicant used cocaine daily. He then
stopped, again on his own, and claims to have been drug-free since August 1991.</P>

<P>	On 18 November 1991, Applicant was terminated from his job (Item 8) effective 19
November 1991, for failure to report back from a leave of absence that Applicant took because of
his drug abuse.<A HREF="96-0105.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	On 10 December 1994, Applicant executed a Personnel Security Questionnaire
(PSQ)(DD Form 398)(Item 4) and answered "yes" to two questions designed to elicit his drug
abuse history. However, he failed to elaborate his "yes" answer to the question about drug
purchases or sales, and thus failed to disclose his purchase and sale of cocaine or his purchases of
marijuana. He also misrepresented his drug abuse by stating that he was drug free from 26
November 1988 (the date of release from his last treatment) to May 1991. In a signed, sworn
statement executed on 27 April 1995 (Item 7), Applicant understated his cocaine use by
suggesting he was drug free from November 1988 until his relapse in May 1991. He also
understated his cocaine purchases, estimating them at $300.00 to $600.00 per week.<A HREF="96-0105.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> He falsified
this statement by denying any involvement in sale of drugs.<A HREF="96-0105.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> In a sworn statement executed 11
September 1995 (Item 6), Applicant stated that he had never specifically sought treatment for his
alcohol abuse; he described his alcohol consumption since July 1988 as moderate, twice weekly
consumption of two beers or a few glasses of wine.<A HREF="96-0105.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> He intended to continue consuming alcohol
at that rate.</P>

<P>	In a sworn statement executed on 24 October 1995 (Item 5), Applicant acknowledged that
he deliberately denied selling drugs in his earlier sworn statement because he feared he would not
get his clearance. He also acknowledged that his three inpatient treatments were for both drug
and alcohol abuse. He acknowledged that benzodiazepine was found in his blood during a blood
screening at the hospital in 1988; he had no recollection of using the drug.</P>

<P>	Applicant claimed to have an excellent work record, but provided no corroboration of that
claim.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in
evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account
the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and
circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in
Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a
particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as
the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </P>

<P>	Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most
pertinent to this case:</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>DRUG INVOLVEMENT (CRITERION H)</STRONG></U> </CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's
willingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair
social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified
information.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(1) any drug abuse;</P>

<P>		(2) illegal drug possession, including . . . purchase, sale . . . </P>

<P>		(3) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by a
credentialed medical professional.</P>

<P>    	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		(1) the drug involvement was not recent.</P>

<P>		(3) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION (CRITERION G)</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment,
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of
classified information due to carelessness.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(3) diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional of alcohol abuse or alcohol
dependence;</P>

<P>		(5) consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a
credentialed medical professional and following completion of an alcohol treatment program.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:	</P>

<P>		(2) the problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a
recent problem.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>PERSONAL CONDUCT (CRITERION E)</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not
properly safeguard classified information.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(2) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts
		from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar
form 		used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or 		trustworthiness. . .;</P>

<P>		(3) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and
		material matters to an investigator, . . . in connection with a personnel security or 		trustworthiness determination;</P>

<P>	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		None.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>CRIMINAL CONDUCT (CRITERION J)</STRONG></U></CENTER>
	</P>

<P>	A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment,
reliability  and trustworthiness.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(1) any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</P>

<P>		(2) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		(1) the criminal behavior was not recent.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.
If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to
establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient
to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise
doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden
of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under criterion H. Applicant's extensive history of
drug abuse raises serious doubts about his fitness for access to classified information. His use,
purchase and sale of cocaine, and his use and purchase of marijuana are inconsistent with the
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of those with access to classified information. The
severity of Applicant's drug problem and his chemical dependence are well documented in the
medical records. He left his last treatment program against medical advice and with a poor
prognosis; indeed he quickly relapsed into drug and alcohol abuse. Against these disqualifying
factors, Applicant counters with only his uncorroborated claim to have been drug free from June
1990 to May 1991, and--after a severe relapse between May and August 1991 which resulted in
Applicant losing his job--after August 1991. Even if I accept Applicant's claim that he has been
drug free since August 1991, the passage of time, standing alone, is insufficient to overcome the
adverse inferences of the drug abuse. The record is silent about the nature and depth of Applicant's
recovery, what led to his relapse in May 1991 or occasioned his cessation of drug abuse in August
1991. Without evidence of changes in lifestyle or attitude underlying his recovery, I am unable to
conclude that Applicant's drug abuse will not recur. Accordingly, I find criterion H. against
Applicant.<A HREF="96-0105.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under criterion G. Applicant's alcohol dependence
is well documented in the medical records. Although there is some evidence to suggest that
Applicant's alcohol abuse was part and parcel of his drug abuse, the record does not clearly establish
the connection. What is clear is that Applicant consumed alcohol abusively after diagnosis as alcohol
dependent--although he never completed the drug/alcohol rehabilitation program--and continues
to consume alcohol, albeit at levels not abusive. The record is silent on the nature of Applicant's
recovery from his earlier alcohol abuse. On these facts, the mere passage of time without apparent
abuse of alcohol is insufficient to overcome the adverse inferences of the well-documented abuse.
Accordingly, I find criterion G. against Applicant.</P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under Criteria E. The information sought by the
Government during the subject interview was relevant and material to the Government's
investigation of the Applicant's fitness for access to classified information, and the Applicant
knowingly and wilfully falsified that information. The record clearly establishes that Applicant knew
that his profit arrangement with his neighbor constituted sale of cocaine. The falsified statement
clearly conveyed that Applicant was paying for his cocaine out of current, legitimate income. I do
not accept Applicant's representations that he initially saw this activity only as supporting his drug
habit, and not actual sales of cocaine. This falsification suggests that Applicant may be unwilling
to disclose adverse information about himself if he perceives it to be contrary to his best interest. I
find criterion E. against the Applicant.</P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under Criteria J. The Applicant's knowing 
falsification to an agency of the federal government on matters within that agency's jurisdiction
clearly violates 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001. The falsification had the potential to influence the course of the
background investigation--in areas of legitimate concern to the Government. The drug sales violated
both state and federal law and demonstrate extremely poor judgment and reliability. I find criterion
J. against the Applicant.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January
2, 1992--and amended by Change 3 dated 16 February 1996  (Directive).
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Applicant was supposed to report back from the leave of absence on 11 November 1991; he failed to do so.
He later agreed to return on 18 November, but did not. Applicant acknowledged (Answer, Item 5) that his 1991 drug
use was a major factor in his losing this job.
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>These omissions/misrepresentations were not alleged in the SOR, and I have not considered them on the merits
of this case. I have, however, considered them on the issue of Applicant's credibility.
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>He bolstered this claim by asserting that he could afford the cocaine on his take-home pay of $1,200.00 per
week.
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>This characterization is inconsistent with Applicant's admission of alcohol abuse in his answer to the SOR,
and is inconsistent with the description of alcohol abuse contained in the medical records (Items 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14).
I conclude Applicant understated the extent of his alcohol abuse in his sworn statement.
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A>However, I find that the record does not support an adverse finding concerning Applicant's use of
benzodiazepine. Applicant acknowledges the positive drug screen, but has no recollection of using the drug. The
Government's evidence proves only the presence of the drug in Applicant's blood. Treatment records clearly indicate
Applicant's drugs of choice as cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol.
