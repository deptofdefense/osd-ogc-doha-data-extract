<P>Applicant has approximately 51 delinquent debts, an approximate total of $85,000.  Much of the debt remains unresolved. He did not sufficiently explain his omission of his delinquent accounts, 
including judgments on his trustworthiness application. Criminal conduct concerns were raised based on this omission and his past criminal history. Concerns under financial considerations, 
personal conduct, and criminal conduct remain. Applicant's eligibility for a assignment to a sensitive position is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On November 15, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust - an ADP I/II/III position. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the 
application under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On August 2, 2006, 
DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under </SPAN>Guideline 
F, Financial Considerations, Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement dated October 12, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN>The case was assigned to me on November 1, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A notice of hearing was 
issued on November 13, 2006, scheduling the hearing for </SPAN>November 30, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The hearing was conducted on that date. The government submitted seven exhibits that were marked as Government 
Exhibits (Gov Ex) 1-7.  The exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted two exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits 
(AE) A and B without objection. The record was held open until December 14, 2006. Applicant did not submit further documents. </SPAN>DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 8, 2006.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 15, 2004, Applicant completed a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85-P).<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  He answered, "No." in response to question "19.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Of the debts alleged in the SOR that Applicant admits to, he has not resolved any of the accounts. He entered into a payment plan in November 2006, for the debt alleged in SOR &para;1.i which relates 
to a debt owed to an insurance company after a car accident.<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  He submitted proof that he started making payments on another account which does not appear to be alleged in the SOR.<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> He claims 
to have paid the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.u and  1.w but has not provided proof of payment. He has not formally disputed any of the debts that he denies. He testified that his paycheck is being garnished 
for the child support he owes but provided no copies of his paycheck verifying this or the current balance of the child support owed. The child support judgments are for his two youngest 
children.<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  He claims the state tax lien alleged in SOR &para; 1.c was paid through wage garnishment but provided no evidence to support this assertion.<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> The debt alleged in SOR &para; 1.d  is not 
Applicant's.  Documentary evidence indicates it is the debt of another individual who has the same name as Applicant but has a different social security number.<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Some of the accounts are medical accounts.  In 2001/2002, Applicant had a heart attack. He  did not have health insurance at the time. Some of the debts were paid by a state health insurance 
program which is similar to Medicaid.<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> He admits to being responsible for some of the medical debts.  I find for Applicant with respect to the medical debt alleged in SOR &para;&para; 1.bb. Applicant 
denies this debt.  The only evidence supporting this allegation is a vague entry on a credit report indicating that it is a medical account which was charged off.<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  The name of a creditor or collection 
agency is not listed. I find the allegation too broad to give proper notice to Applicant about this debt.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also had two periods of unemployment. He was unemployed from January 2002 to March 2002.  He was also unemployed from November 5, 2003, to December 8, 2003.<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P>Applicant claims that when he filled out his trustworthiness application, he was not aware of any debts that were over 180 days old. He claims he did not realize that he had delinquent debts 
including judgments and liens until he was provided a copy of his credit report during his background investigation.<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> Considering the extensive number of judgments filed against Applicant and 
the numerous delinquent accounts, I find Applicant's explanation for not listing his judgments and delinquent debts that were over 180 days old implausible.  At hearing, questions about his 
credibility were further raised by his testimony that he listed information about his child support judgments on his trustworthiness application.<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> In fact, no information pertaining to the child 
support judgments are listed on his trustworthiness application.  He also listed only one of his four children in response to question 10 on the security clearance application. He did not list his two 
younger children - he is obligated to provide child support for these two children.<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> I find his omission of his judgments and delinquent debts were deliberate.  </P>

property, 3rd degree; unlawful possession of marijuana and trespass.<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> On October 18, 1985, he was charged with criminal assault, two counts of domestic violence and destruction of property.  He 
was found guilty of assault and  malicious mischief-domestic violence.<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> On December 17, 2000, he was charged with domestic violence - assault and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.  
He failed to appear in court and a failure to appear warrant was issued on May 1, 2001.<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> On February 15, 2001, he was arrested and charged with threat/intimidate and interfere with judicial 
proceedings-domestic violence. He pled guilty to interfere with judicial proceedings-domestic violence.  He was sentenced to 12 months probation and required to attend eight weeks of domestic 
violence counseling.<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> He completed the terms of his sentence. He has not been arrested nor had any further incidents of domestic violence since that time.<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards.  The government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations; 
Guideline E - Personal Conduct; and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>); and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>Inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>)<EM> </EM>apply to Applicant's case.  Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations since 1998. The SOR alleged approximately 51 delinquent accounts with a 
total approximate balance of over $85,000.  Some of these delinquent accounts may be duplicates of each other, however, the burden was on Applicant to provide proof of the current status of his 
accounts.  He did not provided sufficient evidence to indicate any of the SOR allegations related to the same debt.</P> 
 
<P>I considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC).  Applicant has numerous delinquent debts which remain unresolved. Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The 
behavior was not recent</EM>), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>The behavior was isolated</EM>).  He has a nine year history of financial irresponsibility so the behavior is not isolated.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a 
death, divorce, or separation)</EM>) applies, in part. Several medical bills were incurred as a result of Applicant's heart attack in late 2001/early 2002.  He did not have health insurance at time of his 
heart attack.  The state paid some of the bills but not all. He also had two brief periods of unemployment. However, this does not explain the full extent of his nine year history of financial 
irresponsibility. Although MC 3 applies, in part, one must also consider a person's actions towards resolving the delinquent debt. Based on Applicant's minimal actions in resolving his delinquent 
debt, I give MC 3 little weight. </P> 
 
<P>I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control</EM>) since 
Applicant has not attended financial counseling.  He continues to have numerous unresolved delinquent debt.  It is unlikely that his financial problems will be resolved in the near future.</P> 
 
<P>While I acknowledge Applicant provided evidence that he took steps to resolve two of his delinquent accounts,<A HREF="06-10343.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A> I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>). He has taken little action to resolve the majority of his delinquent accounts other than the child support accounts which are being repaid through 
wage garnishment.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has not mitigated the security concern under Guideline F.  Guideline F is decided against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard 
classified information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security clearance or in 
other official matters is a security concern.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  </P> 
 
<P>I conclude that Applicant deliberately omitted his judgments in response to question 19 and his numerous debts that were over 180 days old in response to question 20. Personal Conduct 
Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award 
fiduciary responsibilities</EM>) applies.  Although Applicant claims that he did not deliberately withhold his  judgments in response to question 19 and his delinquent debts in response to question 20 on 
the trustworthiness application, his explanation that he was not aware that he had delinquent debt lacks credibility considering the extent of his delinquent debt. When he signed the application, he 
certified that his answers were "true, complete, and correct to best of his knowledge and belief and are made in good faith." The government expects Applicants for trustworthiness determinations to 
tell the truth at all times. Considering the extent of his delinquent debt, I find he deliberately did not list his debts on his trustworthiness application.  </P> 
 
<P>I find that none of the mitigating conditions apply under personal conduct. Guideline E is decided against Applicant.<STRONG> </STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The government established its case under Guideline J.  From July 1979 to February 2001, Applicant was arrested on four occasions.  His most recent criminal conduct was his deliberate 
falsification on his November 15, 2004, security clearance application which violates Title 18 United States Code &sect; 1001.  Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1: 
(<EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>) and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2: (<EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>)<EM> </EM>are raised in 
Applicant's case.</P> 
 
<P>The criminal conduct concern can be mitigated.  Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC)  E2.A10.1.3.1: (<EM>The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>) does not apply since the falsification 
occurred during Applicant's most recent background investigation.  It is recent.  CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2 (<EM>The crime was an isolated incident</EM>) does not apply since Applicant has a prior criminal 
history. It is too soon to apply CC DC E2.A10.1.3.6: (<EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>) due to the recency of the deliberate falsification. Applicant has not mitigated the criminal 
conduct concern. Guideline J is decided against Applicant.<STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a 
person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in 
considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own 
merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the evidence and the "whole person" in evaluating Applicant's trustworthiness. I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence that it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.</P>
