<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On October 5, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
denied or revoked. </P> 
<P>On October 31, 2001, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge on the 
basis of the written record, without a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted a File a Relevant Material (FORM) on December 19, 2001.  The FORM includes 
12 Government Exhibits (GX) 1 - 12.  Instructions accompanying the FORM informed Applicant that any response to the FORM had to be submitted within 30 
days of receipt of the FORM.  Applicant has not submitted any response to the FORM.  The case was assigned to me for decision on February 8, 2002.  </P>

6, 7).</P> 
<P>SOR 5.b. - Applicant falsified material facts on a security clearance application (SF 86) dated April 16, 1999, when he answered "No" to: "Question <STRONG>26 - Your

<P>GUIDELINE J - Criminal Conduct</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">The Concern: </SPAN>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The number and diversity of the allegations, all of which are supported by substantial evidence,  makes a strong case for the Government that Applicant has 
demonstrated poor judgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness over a considerable period of time and in a variety of ways.  </P> 
<P>Guideline J - The arrests and convictions in 1989, 1990, 1995, and 1997 establish a pattern that has not been shown to have been broken.  Applicant's multiple 
falsifications on his security clearance application (April 16, 1999) (Government Exhibit (GX) 4) and in his sworn statements to a Defense Security Service 
(DSS) agent (September 25, 1999 and November 2, 1999 (GX 5)) are all criminal violations of 18 USC 1001.  From the totality of this conduct, I find the 
conduct and the impact of the conduct to still be recent and not an isolated incident.   </P> 
<P>Guideline G - Applicant's excessive use and abuse of alcohol began in 1986 or 1987, when he was 23/24 years old.  He admits excessive use of alcohol use 
after his 1997 alcohol-related arrest, but claims it was at a lower rate.  He also claims (1) he is "in complete control right now" and (2) no present use of alcohol 
in his October 31, 2001 response to the SOR (GX 3).  Based on the totality of the evidence, I am unable to give much credibility to this undocumented claim.   </P> 
<P>Guideline H - Applicant admits all of the SOR's drug allegations but claims he last used marijuana in January 2000, which was after the current security 
clearance process began.  Although I conclude that Applicant is not currently using, or is addicted to, marijuana, his drug use is clearly recent, not isolated, 
without a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional, and no rehabilitation has been demonstrated.</P> 
<P>Guideline F - The debts are mostly admitted by Applicant, with explanations that he simply has not had the funds to pay them off, but that the debts would not 
lead him to perform illegal acts to generate funds (GX 3).  I conclude Applicant has not made any good faith efforts to resolve the debts, which exceed $30,000, 
with several thousand dollars more in child support arrearage. </P> 
<P>Guideline E - Applicant admits, with explanations, all five allegations under this guideline.  After considering all of his explanations, I conclude he has not 
mitigated the impact of the evidence in support of the SOR. </P> 
<P>Although Applicant sees himself as a trustworthy and reliable person, his past conduct indicates otherwise.  With so much misconduct over so long a period of 
time, a longer AND documented period of rehabilitation is necessary before he can establish his eligibility for access to the nation's secrets.  The totality of the 
evidence in the FORM does not provide such evidence. </P>
