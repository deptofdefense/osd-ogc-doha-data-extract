  Board does not review isolated sentences in a decision; rather it will read the Administrative Judge's decision in its entirety to determine what findings the Judge made and what conclusions the Judge reached.   Board will not construe or interpret  provisions of the Directive in a manner that leads to foolish or absurd results.  Judge is not required to discuss Financial  Considerations mitigating conditions when there is no record evidence to support their application.  It is possible for a series of  otherwise individually harmless errors to reach a point that their cumulative effect would preclude a conclusion that the errors are  harmless.  When considered individually or cumulatively, the Judge's errors in this case do not warrant remand or reversal in light  of the record evidence as a whole.  Applicant's history of unresolved financial difficulties provides a sufficient basis for the Judge's  adverse conclusions under Guideline F.   Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>Administrative Judge Darlene Lokey Anderson issued a decision, dated October 27, 2000, in which she concluded it is not clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the reasons 
set forth below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), 
dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's financial 
situation posed a security risk; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge failed to comply with pertinent provisions of the 
Directive.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated May 31, 2000 to Applicant.  The SOR 
was based on Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  A hearing was held on September 15, 2000.  The Administrative Judge 
issued a written decision, dated October 27, 2000, in which she concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from the Judge's adverse 
decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's financial situation posed a security risk</SPAN>.  Applicant contends 
the Administrative Judge erred by concluding the facts and circumstances of Applicant's financial situation pose a security risk.  In 
support of this contention, Applicant argues: (a) some of the Judge's factual findings are inaccurate; (b) the Judge erred by 
referring to criminal conduct in her decision; (c) the record evidence does not support the Judge's conclusion that Department 
Counsel met its initial burden of proving Applicant experienced excessive financial indebtedness; (d) Department Counsel failed 
to establish any risk that Applicant has engaged in or is at risk of engaging in illegal acts because of his financial situation; (e) the 
Judge erred by concluding Applicant failed to present persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation, or mitigation because 
Department Counsel failed to prove any case that required Applicant to rebut, explain, or mitigate; and (f) even if Department 
Counsel met its initial burden, Applicant presented evidence that rebutted, explained, and mitigated the government's case against 
him.</P> 
 
<P>(a) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Administrative Judge's factual findings</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge made factual findings about the facts and circumstances 
surrounding Applicant's financial difficulties, Applicant's efforts to deal with them, and Applicant's current financial situation 
(which includes approximately $180,000 of still unsatisfied debts).  On appeal, Applicant indicates he "does not dispute any major 
aspect of the Findings of Fact portion of the Decision at pages 2-4, as far as they go."  However, Applicant challenges the 
following findings by the Judge: (i) Applicant owes the debt alleged in SOR paragraph 1.a.; (ii) Applicant has not satisfied the 
debt covered by SOR paragraph 1.b.; and (iii) Applicant has not satisfied the debt covered by SOR paragraph 1.e.<A HREF="00-0104.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 
<P>The Administrative Judge's finding about SOR paragraph 1.a. reflects a plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  Given the 
particular facts of this case, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to conclude Applicant is responsible for this debt.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's challenge to the Administrative Judge's finding about SOR paragraph 1.b. is based on his assertion that, since the 
hearing, he has paid that debt.  Applicant's assertion constitutes new evidence, which the Board cannot consider.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  As of the close of the record below, Applicant had not satisfied the debt covered 
by SOR paragraph 1.b.  Accordingly, the Judge's finding about that debt is well-founded and sustainable on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's challenge to the Administrative Judge's finding about SOR paragraph 1.e. is based on his contention that: (i) he 
testified that one part of the $18,000 debt had been paid; (ii) he testified that another part of the debt has been subject to good faith 
efforts to pay; and (iii) since the hearing he has made a payment toward the debt.  As indicated in the preceding paragraph, the 
Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Furthermore, the Judge was not required to accept Applicant's testimony about 
this debt at face value.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0519 (February 23, 2001) at p. 12.  The absence of documentation to 
corroborate claims of satisfying debts is relevant in deciding whether such claims should be accepted.  <EM>Cf</EM>. ISCR Case No. 98-0419 
(April 30, 1999) at p. 4 (in concluding Administrative Judge failed to take into account an applicant's failure to provide 
documentation to support his general statements about his financial interests, the Board noted an applicant reasonably can be 
expected to have or be able to get documentation concerning his financial interests such as income, checking and savings accounts, 
business assets, and accrued  retirement funds).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also makes arguments that essentially concede the Administrative Judge's findings of fact concerning the debts covered 
by SOR paragraphs 1.d., 1.g., 1.h.,  but which seek to present  a favorable interpretation of those debts.  Our resolution of 
Applicant's arguments on these points is subsumed in the Board's discussion below of Applicant's contention that he presented 
evidence that rebutted, explained, and mitigated Department Counsel's case against him.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant also challenges the Administrative Judge's formal finding against him with respect to SOR paragraph 1.i., arguing that 
the adverse formal finding is not justified in light of the Judge's specific factual findings about his current income and monthly 
expenses.  Applicant's argument has merit.  Given the Judge's factual findings on this aspect of the case, it was arbitrary and 
capricious for the Judge to enter a formal finding against Applicant with respect to SOR paragraph 1.i.  However, the error was 
harmless because, upon consideration of the whole record, there is not a significant chance that, but for this error, the Judge would 
have reached a different result. <EM> See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0657 (November 16, 1999) at p. 3.</P> 
 
<P>(b) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Administrative Judge's reference to criminal conduct</SPAN>.  Applicant points to the following passage in the Administrative Judge's 
decision: "The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in criminal conduct, which demonstrates poor judgment, untrustworthiness or unreliability."  Applicant 
argues the Judge erred because there is no record evidence that he ever engaged in criminal conduct or any conduct that indicates 
poor judgment, untrustworthiness or unreliability.  Applicant asks the Board to reverse the Judge's decision to the extent the cited 
passage is erroneous.</P> 
 
<P>The Board does not review isolated sentences in an Administrative Judge's decision; rather, the Board will read the Judge's 
decision in its entirety to determine what the findings the Judge made and what conclusions the Judge reached.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 00-0311 (March 8, 2001) at p. 2.  Reading the Judge's decision in its entirety, the Board concludes the passage cited by 
Applicant is an unexplained anomaly, not an integral part of the Judge's analysis of Applicant's history of financial difficulties.  
Under the particular facts of this case, the anomaly constitutes harmless error that does not warrant remand or reversal because 
there is not a significant chance that, but for this error, the Judge would have reached a different result.</P> 
 
<P>(c) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Department Counsel's burden of proof</SPAN>.  Applicant contends the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Department Counsel 
met its initial burden of proof under Guideline F because  the record evidence does not support the Judge's conclusion that 
Applicant's history of financial difficulties indicates "poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the 
Applicant."  Applicant's argument fails to demonstrate harmful error by the Judge.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal brief sets forth arguments for why the facts and circumstances of his history of financial difficulties are not 
indicative of poor judgment, unreliability, or untrustworthiness on his part.  However, Applicant's arguments fail to demonstrate 
harmful error because they essentially aim to rebut two sentences in the Judge's decision.  As discussed earlier in this decision, the 
Board does not review isolated sentences in a Judge's decision.  The Judge's use of the phrase "poor judgment, unreliability and 
untrustworthiness" is difficult to reconcile with her conclusions that Applicant became indebted due to circumstances reasonably 
outside of his control and that Applicant is making some progress toward reducing his indebtedness.  Thus, the Judge's use of the 
phrase constituted error.  Such error is harmless, however, since the use of the phrase does not undercut the Judge's basic analysis 
of the case.  Since there is not a significant chance that, but for this error, the Judge would gave reached a different result, the error 
is harmless.  Additionally, such error does not change the fact that Department Counsel met its initial burden of proof in this case 
by establishing that Applicant has a history of financial difficulties that is still not resolved.</P> 
 
<P>(d) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Department Counsel's failure to prove risk</SPAN>.  Applicant contends Department Counsel failed to establish there is any risk that he 
has engaged in or is at risk of engaging in illegal acts because of his financial situation.  Applicant is correct in arguing that 
Department Counsel has not proven he has engaged in any illegal acts because of his financial situation.  While proof of such 
illegal acts would be relevant under Guideline F, it is not necessary to warrant an adverse security clearance decision under 
Guideline F.</P> 
 
<P>The federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to classified 
information.  <EM>Snepp v. United States</EM>, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).  Security clearance decisions are not an exact science, but 
rather are predictive judgments about a person's security suitability in light of that person's past conduct and present circumstances.  
<EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).  The federal government need not wait until an applicant mishandles or 
fails to properly handle or safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such information.  <EM>Adams v. 
Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238-39 (D.C. Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  Direct or objective evidence of nexus is not 
required before the government can deny or revoke access to classified information.  <EM>Gayer v. Schlesinger</EM>, 490 F.2d 740, 750 
(D.C. Cir. 1973).  All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling 
classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness 
required of persons handling classified information.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0296 (April 18, 2000) at p. 5.</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline F, the security eligibility of an applicant is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of 
excessive indebtedness or recurring financial difficulties.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 96-0454 (February 7, 1997) at p. 2.  "Furthermore, 
'[f]inancial difficulties, financial irresponsibility and greed have proven to be significant motivating forces for espionage or 
attempted espionage.  It is clear that the United States must consider whether individuals granted access to classified information 
are, through financial irresponsibility, greed <EM>or financial misfortune</EM>, in a position where they may be more susceptible to 
mishandling or compromising classified information or material for financial gain.'"  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (May 2, 1996) at pp. 
2-3 (quoting earlier Board decision)(italics added).  <EM>Accord</EM> ISCR Case No. 99-0296 (April 18, 2000) at p. 6. </P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel does not have to prove that an applicant poses a "clear and present danger" to national security, <EM>Smith v. 
Schlesinger</EM>, 513 F.2d 462, 476 n.48 (D.C. Cir. 1975), or that an applicant poses an imminent threat of engaging in criminal acts.  
Under Guideline F, it is sufficient that the evidence shows an applicant has a history of unresolved financial difficulties that places 
the applicant in a situation where he or she is more vulnerable or susceptible to bribery or financial pressures.  <EM>See </EM>DISCR Case 
No. 87-1800 (February 14, 1989) at p. 4 n. 3 (citing espionage cases where financial difficulties were a motivating factor).  In 
areas not involving national security concerns, the government has a legitimate interest in protecting against bribery attempts 
aimed at its officers, employees, or agents.  <EM>See Marshall v. District of Columbia Government</EM>, 559 F.2d 726, 729-730 (D.C. Cir. 
1977).  <EM>Accord Waide v. United States</EM>, 229 Ct. Cl. 833, 835 (1982).  Given the legitimate governmental interest in avoiding or 
reducing the risk that law enforcement officers may be vulnerable to bribery or other financial misconduct due to personal 
financial difficulties, it follows that the federal government has a greater interest in avoiding or reducing the risk that persons 
granted access to classified information might mishandle or fail to properly safeguard classified information because their 
unresolved financial difficulties make them vulnerable or susceptible to bribery or other undue financial pressures.  <EM>Cf. Gayer v. 
Schlesinger</EM>, 490 F.2d 740, 750 (D.C. Cir. 1973)(government may act on basis of lesser degree of risk to national security than it 
may on basis of risk to efficiency of civil service).</P> 
 
<P>Even in the absence of any illegal acts, Applicant's financial misfortune left him with  financial difficulties that were unresolved as 
of the close of record in his case.  Department Counsel was not required to prove more to warrant the Administrative Judge's 
conclusion that Applicant's history of financial difficulties raised security concerns under Guideline F.</P> 
 
<P>(e/f) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Applicant's burden of explanation, extenuation or mitigation</SPAN>.  Applicant contends the Administrative Judge erred by 
concluding Applicant failed to present persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation, or mitigation because Department Counsel 
failed to prove any case that required Applicant to rebut, explain, or mitigate.  As discussed earlier in this decision, the record 
evidence of Applicant's history of financial difficulties raised security concerns.  Accordingly, Applicant had the burden of 
presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate his history of financial difficulties.  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.15.  Applicant's argument that he had no burden in this case is simply untenable.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant contends, in the alternative, that even if Department Counsel met its initial burden, he presented evidence that rebutted, 
explained, and mitigated the government's case against him.  In support of this contention, Applicant argues: (i) the Administrative 
Judge failed to evaluate his case under the whole person requirement of Directive, Item E2.2.3; and (ii) if the Judge had properly 
evaluated his case under the nine factors enumerated under Directive, Item E2.2.1 a favorable security clearance decision would 
have resulted.  Applicant's arguments are not persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>Reading the Administrative Judge's decision in its entirety, the Board concludes the Judge complied with the requirements of 
Directive, Item E2.2.3 by considering the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant's financial difficulties, including their 
origin and his efforts at addressing and resolving them.  Applicant's strong disagreement with the Judge's analysis falls far short of 
demonstrating the Judge did not comply with the requirements of Directive, Item E2.2.3.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge specifically cited the factors enumerated under Directive, Item E2.2.1.  Furthermore, a reading of the 
Judge's decision shows the Judge did more than merely cite those factors.  Apart from the harmless errors discussed above, the 
Judge's decision reflects a reasonable consideration of Applicant's case in light of the various Item E2.2.1 factors.  The Judge had 
the responsibility of weighing the favorable and unfavorable evidence and deciding whether the favorable evidence outweighed the 
unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  Applicant's ability to argue for a more favorable weighing of the record evidence is not 
sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the record evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge concluded Applicant's efforts at addressing and reducing his financial problems were insufficient to 
resolve the security concerns raised by Applicant's remaining unsatisfied debts (excluding his mortgage) of approximately 
$180,000.  That conclusion has a rational basis in the record evidence, and the Judge properly resolved her doubts in favor of the 
national security.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Item E2.2.2 ("Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with 
national security will be resolved in favor of the national security.").</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge failed to comply with pertinent provisions of the Directive</SPAN>.  Applicant contends the 
Administrative Judge erred by not complying with various provisions of the Directive.  In support of this contention, Applicant 
argues: (a) the Judge did not consider the factors enumerated by Directive, Section 6.3; (b) the Judge did not evaluate Applicant's 
case under each of the 13 Guidelines listed by Directive, Item E2.2.3; (c) the Judge made no finding under Directive, Item E2.2.4 
that would permit her to make an adverse decision based only on Guideline F; (d) the Judge did not consider the factors listed 
under Directive, Item E2.2.5; and (e) the Judge failed to consider all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions.</P> 
 
<P>(a) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Directive, Section 6.3</SPAN>.  Section 6.3 requires each security clearance decision to be a fair and impartial common sense decision 
based on consideration of all the relevant information, including consideration of the six factors enumerated in Section 6.3.  On 
page 5 of the decision, the Administrative Judge listed the nine factors enumerated by Directive, Item E.2.2.1.  Those nine factors 
essentially duplicate the six factors enumerated in Section 6.3.  Furthermore, a reading of the decision below shows the Judge 
discussed the nature, seriousness and circumstances surrounding Applicant's conduct (Section 6.3.1), the frequency and recency of 
Applicant's conduct (Section 6.3.2), Applicant's age (Section 6.3.3), Applicant's motivation and state of mind (Section 6.3.4), the 
absence or presence of evidence of financial rehabilitation by Applicant (Section 6.3.5), and the likelihood that Applicant's 
financial difficulties would continue (Section 6.3.6).  In view of the foregoing, the absence of a specific listing of each of the 
Section 6.3 factors in the Judge's decision does not demonstrate the Judge failed to consider them in Applicant's case.</P> 
 
<P>(b) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Directive, Item E2.2.3</SPAN>.  Applicant correctly notes that Item E2.2.3 lists the thirteen Guidelines (A through M) under which the 
security eligibility of an applicant is evaluated.  However, Applicant's argument relies on an interpretation of Item E2.2.3 that 
would lead to the absurd result that every single applicant would have his or her case evaluated under all 13 guidelines regardless 
of the specific allegations set forth in the SOR issued to the applicant.  The Board will not construe or interpret provisions of the 
Directive in a manner that leads to foolish or absurd results.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0452 (March 21, 2000) at pp. 5-6.  <EM>Cf. 
arques v. Fitzgerald</EM>, 99 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1996)("[A] statute may not be construed in a manner that results in absurdities or 
defeats its underlying purpose."); <EM>Yerdon v. Henry</EM>, 91 F.3d 370, 376 (2d Cir. 1996) (courts should reject party's interpretation of 
statute that would lead to absurd or futile results that are at plain variance with the policy of the statute as a whole).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's argument also is based on a flawed premise.  The mere fact Department Counsel has not alleged or proven that 
Applicant has engaged in conduct which falls under Guidelines A through E or Guidelines G through M does not mean that 
Applicant's conduct and circumstances do not raise security concerns under Guideline F.  Furthermore, a favorable security 
clearance decision is not mandated merely because an applicant's conduct is not as serious as it possibly could be.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0532 (February 27, 2001) at p. 8.</P> 
 
<P>(c) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Directive, Item E2.2.4</SPAN>.<A HREF="00-0104.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
<P>  Applicant argues: (i) Directive, Item E2.2.4 precludes an adverse security clearance decision based on 
a single Guideline unless there has been a finding that an applicant has demonstrated a recent or recurring pattern of questionable 
judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior; (ii) the Judge made no such finding in his case;  therefore, (iii) the 
Judge's adverse decision must be reversed.  Applicant's argument lacks merit.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's argument seeks to: (i) interpret and apply Directive, Item E2.2.4 in isolation from the rest of the Directive; (ii) turn the 
word "may" into "can"; and (iii) read Directive, Item E2.2.4 in a narrow, idiosyncratic manner that would lead to absurd results 
that are inconsistent with the basic purposes of the industrial security program.  Provisions of the Directive should not be 
interpreted and construed in isolation from other pertinent provisions of the Directive.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 99-0447 (July 25, 
2000) at p. 5.  Furthermore, provisions of the Directive must be interpreted and construed in a reasonable manner that furthers the 
purposes of the industrial security program.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0395 (June 24, 1999) at p. 4 n.2; ISCR Case No. 97-0783 
(August 7, 1998) at p. 4.  Moreover, provisions of the Directive should not be interpreted and construed in a manner that will result 
in anomalous or absurd results.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 99-0452 (March 21, 2000) at pp. 5-6.  <EM>Cf. Marques v. Fitzgerald</EM>, 99 F.3d 1, 5 
(1st Cir. 1996)("[A] statute may not be construed in a manner that results in absurdities or defeats its underlying purpose."); 
<EM>Yerdon v. Henry</EM>, 91 F.3d 370, 376 (2d Cir. 1996) (courts should reject party's interpretation of statute that would lead to absurd or 
futile results that are at plain variance with the policy of the statute as a whole).</P> 
 
<P>Directive, Item E2.2.4 does not preclude adverse security clearance decisions based on a single Guideline.  All Directive, Item 
E2.2.4 does is provide guidance for security adjudicators on how to deal with cases where the adverse information may be deemed 
not sufficient to justify an unfavorable security clearance decision under any single Guideline.  If an adjudicator reasonably 
concludes that the adverse information in a case is sufficient to warrant an unfavorable decision under a single Guideline, then the 
adjudicator does not need to consider or apply Directive, Item E2.2.4.  In this case, the Administrative Judge concluded the record 
evidence in this case warranted an adverse security clearance decision under Guideline F.  Accordingly, the Judge had no 
obligation to consider or apply Directive, Item E2.2.4.</P> 
 
<P>(d) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Directive, Item E2.2.5</SPAN>.  Applicant argues the Administrative Judge's decision does not reflect any consideration of the six 
factors enumerated by Directive, Item E2.2.5.  Applicant's argument fails to demonstrate the Judge committed harmful error.</P> 
 
<P>The failure of the Administrative Judge to specifically cite or list the factors enumerated under Directive, Item E2.2.5 does not 
automatically constitute error.  As discussed in connection with Applicant's argument concerning Directive, Section 6.3, the Board 
will consider the Judge's decision in its entirety to determine whether the Judge complied with the requirements of Directive, Item 
E2.2.5.</P> 
 
<P>Nothing in the Administrative Judge's decision indicates the Administrative Judge specifically considered the fact that Applicant 
reported information about his financial difficulties and responded to questions put to him about them.  Accordingly, Applicant's 
argument is not frivolous with respect to Directive, Item E2.2.5.1<A HREF="00-0104.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and Item E2.2.5.2.<A HREF="00-0104.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  However, implicit in the Judge's decision 
is a favorable credibility determination because the Judge made many findings of fact based on acceptance of Applicant's 
testimony and documentary evidence.  And, in any event, Applicant's candor with the government did not preclude the Judge from 
considering the security significance of Applicant's history of financial difficulties.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0519 (February 
23, 2001) at p. 14.</P> 
 
<P>There is no record evidence that Applicant sought assistance or professional guidance to deal with his financial difficulties.  
Accordingly, Applicant cannot claim any benefit from consideration of Directive, Item E2.2.5.3.<A HREF="00-0104.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge discussed Applicant's history of financial difficulties,  considered Applicant's efforts at dealing with and 
resolving his outstanding debts, concluded that Applicant had not yet resolved all of his outstanding debts, and explained why she 
concluded it was too soon to conclude Applicant had resolved the security concerns raised by his history of financial difficulties.  
Nothing more is required from the Judge by Directive, Item E2.2.5.4.<A HREF="00-0104.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 
<P>In discussing Applicant's efforts at dealing with and resolving his outstanding debts,  the Administrative Judge recognized that 
Applicant has made changes in his behavior and employment that helped him address his financial difficulties.  Nothing more is 
required from the Judge by Directive, Item E2.2.5.5.<A HREF="00-0104.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is correct in noting the Administrative Judge's decision does not contain any finding that falls under the terms of 
Directive, Item E2.2.5.6.<A HREF="00-0104.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  However, the Judge's decision does not recommend that Applicant's security clearance decision be 
suspended.  Rather, the Judge's decision is an adjudication on the merits of Applicant's security eligibility.  Nothing in the 
Directive indicates or suggests that an applicant's security clearance case must involve an explicit two-step, bifurcated decision 
that first addresses whether to suspend the applicant's access temporarily, and then addresses whether to deny or revoke access.  
And, in any event, Directive, Item E2.2.5.6  is intended for the protection of the national security interests of the United States, not 
for the benefit of an applicant.  Accordingly, even if an adjudicator fails to consider Directive, Item E2.2.5.6, the federal 
government, not the applicant, is the injured party.  Therefore, Applicant's reliance on Directive, Item E2.2.5.6 is misplaced.</P> 
 
<P>(e) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions</SPAN>.  Applicant contends the Administrative Judge erred by not considering all the 
Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions in his case.  Applicant also contends that application of Financial Considerations 
itigating Condition 1, Mitigating Condition 2, Mitigating Condition 3 and Mitigating Condition 6 would lead to a favorable 
decision in his case.  Applicant's contentions are not persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>There is no merit to Applicant's argument about Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 1.<A HREF="00-0104.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  The Administrative Judge 
specifically found, and the record evidence shows, that Applicant still has unsatisfied debts (exclusive of his mortgage) worth 
approximately $180,000.  Therefore, the Judge was not required to give Applicant the benefit of Financial Considerations 
itigating Condition 1.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge did not apply Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 2.<A HREF="00-0104.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> 
<P>  Applicant's argument about Financial 
Considerations Mitigating Condition 2 raises an alternate interpretation of the record evidence, but it is not the only plausible 
interpretation of the evidence.  The Administrative Judge's discussion of the facts and circumstances of Applicant's history of 
financial difficulties reflects a reasonable, plausible interpretation of the record evidence and provides a rational basis for the Judge 
to conclude that Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 2 was not applicable.  Accordingly, Applicant has failed to 
demonstrate the Judge erred.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0620 (June 22, 1999) at p. 3 ("Applicant's ability to argue for an alternate 
explanation of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge erred.").</P> 
 
<P>Applicant offers no argument why the Administrative Judge should have applied Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions 
4<A HREF="00-0104.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and 5.<A HREF="00-0104.a1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  There is no record evidence that would appear to support application of either of those two mitigating conditions.  It 
would elevate form over substance to require a Judge to discuss mitigating conditions that are not applicable to an applicant's case.  
It is groundless for Applicant to suggest he was harmed in any way by the fact the Judge did not discuss these two mitigating 
conditions when there is no record evidence to support their application.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant acknowledges that the Administrative Judge applied Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions 3<A HREF="00-0104.a1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  and 6<A HREF="00-0104.a1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> 
<P> to his 
case.  Applicant argues that the Judge should have made a favorable security clearance decision based on application of the 
Financial Considerations mitigating conditions.  Applicant's argument is not persuasive.  First, as discussed earlier, Applicant has 
failed to demonstrate the Judge was required to apply Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions 1 and 2.  Second, Applicant 
places too much significance on the application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions 3 and 6.  In general, the mere 
presence or absence of Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying or mitigating conditions is not dispositive of a case.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 00-0016 (October 23, 2000) at p. 4.  The Judge must consider the record as a whole and decide whether the favorable 
evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  Accordingly, the Judge's application of Financial Considerations 
itigating Conditions 3 and 6 did not preclude the Judge from making an adverse security clearance decision based on her 
evaluation of Applicant's overall history of financial difficulties and his current financial situation, which includes unsatisfied 
debts (not including his mortgage) of approximately $180,000.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has identified several errors by the Administrative Judge that, individually, are harmless when considered in light of the 
record evidence as a whole.  Just as the Board does not review isolated sentences in a Judge's decision, the Board does not consider 
a Judge's errors in isolation.  This is because it is possible for a series of otherwise individually harmless errors to reach a point 
that their cumulative effect would preclude a conclusion that the errors are harmless.  In this case, Applicant has failed to meet his 
burden on appeal of demonstrating errors that, when considered individually or cumulatively, warrant remand or reversal in light 
of the record evidence as a whole.  Accordingly, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's October 27, 2000 decision.</P>
