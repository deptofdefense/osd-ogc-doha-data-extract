<P>Administrative Judge Jerome H. Silber issued a decision, dated July 19, 1999,<A HREF="99-0019.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> in which he concluded it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Department Counsel appealed.  For the reasons set forth below,
the Board reverses the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated
January 2, 1992, as amended.</P>

<P>Department Counsel's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge's findings are supported by substantial
record evidence; (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred in applying Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions 1 and 3; and (3)
whether the Administrative Judge's security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. </P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated January 20, 1999.  The SOR was
based on Criterion H (Drug Involvement).</P>

<P>A hearing was held on May 21, 1999.  The Administrative Judge subsequently issued a written decision in which he concluded it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P>

<P>The case is before the Board on Department Counsel's appeal from the Administrative Judge's favorable decision.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's findings are supported by substantial record evidence</SPAN>.  Department Counsel contends the record
evidence does not support the Administrative Judge's findings that: (a) Applicant's marijuana use was not recent; (b) Applicant
demonstrated an intent not  to use marijuana in the future; (c) Applicant's marijuana use was "relatively minor"; and (d) Applicant did not
use marijuana during the 1984-1988 period when he held a security clearance.</P>

<P>(a/b) Department Counsel's arguments about the first two challenged findings overlap with its arguments about the Administrative Judge's
application of Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions 1 and 3.  Those arguments will be addressed later in this decision.</P>

<P>(c) The Administrative Judge characterized Applicant's overall history of marijuana use as "relatively minor."  The Judge's
characterization of Applicant's occasional use of marijuana over a period of 18 years as "relatively minor" does not reflect a reasonable
interpretation of the record evidence.  The Board will not affirm factual findings that do not reflect a reasonable, plausible interpretation of
the record evidence as a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0201 (October 12, 1999) at p. 4.</P>

<P>(d) There is conflicting record evidence on whether Applicant used marijuana during the 1984-1988 period when he held a security
clearance.  The Board need not agree with the Administrative Judge to conclude Department Counsel's argument fails to demonstrate the
Judge's finding on this point is unsustainable.</P>

<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in applying Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions 1 and 3</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge
indicated that Applicant's last use of marijuana "was fairly recent and makes problematic mitigation based exclusively upon [Drug
Involvement Mitigating Condition] #1 . . . [Applicant] has, however, demonstrated his intent to never abuse drugs, including marijuana, in
the future.  This falls squarely within [Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition] #3."  Department Counsel contends the record evidence
does not warrant the Judge's application of those Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 1</SPAN>.<A HREF="99-0019.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The Administrative Judge's discussion of Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 1
demonstrates the Judge analyzed Applicant's marijuana use in an arbitrary and capricious manner.  Given the record evidence that
Applicant last used marijuana within 12 months of the hearing, it was reasonable for the Judge to find Applicant's last use of marijuana
was "fairly recent."  Once the Judge concluded Applicant's last use of marijuana was "fairly recent," it was arbitrary and capricious for the
Judge to rely on Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 1.  Drug use that is "fairly recent" cannot reasonably be considered "not recent"
within the meaning of Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 1.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 3</SPAN>.<A HREF="99-0019.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  In support of applying Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 3, the Administrative Judge
relied on his findings that (a) Applicant refrained from using marijuana during the 1984-1988 period he had a security clearance; (b) by
the time of the hearing, Applicant had refrained from marijuana use for approximately a year; and (c) Applicant  realized his occasional
use of marijuana in social situations was unwise because such use might compromise his girl friend's petition (last year) for child custody. 
For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes the Judge's application of Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 3 is not sustainable.</P>

<P>As discussed earlier in this decision, the Board need not agree with the Administrative Judge to sustain his finding that Applicant did not
use marijuana during the 1984-1988 period he had a security clearance.  Furthermore, Department Counsel does not challenge the Judge's
finding that Applicant last used marijuana around June 1998.  And, the Judge's finding about Applicant's concern about the potential
adverse effects his use of marijuana might have on his girl friend has support in the record evidence.  However, the Judge's application of
Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 3 in this case is problematic.</P>

<P>The fact that there is record evidence to support an Administrative Judge's findings does not end the analysis.  The Board must consider
whether: (a) there is record evidence that fairly detracts from a Judge's factual findings (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item
32.a); and (b) whether the inferences and conclusions drawn by the Judge are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law (Directive,
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 32.b.).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (Administrative Judge's decision
may be arbitrary and capricious even though the Judge's specific findings of fact are supported by record evidence).  <EM>Cf. United States v.
International Brotherhood of Teamsters</EM>, 170 F.3d 136, 143 (2d Cir. 1999)(even if agency's findings of fact are supported by substantial
evidence, reviewing court must guard against agency drawing inferences that are arbitrary in relation to the facts found).</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge's conclusion that Applicant demonstrated an intent to refrain from drug abuse in the future failed to take into
consideration record evidence that reasonably detracts from that conclusion, and reflects an arbitrary and capricious analysis.  Although
the Judge found that Applicant did not use marijuana during the period 1984-1988, the record evidence shows that Applicant used
marijuana, on an occasional basis, from 1989 to at least June 1998 without any regard for the illegality of his conduct.  Although the Judge
found that Applicant last used marijuana in June 1998, that finding must be considered in light of (i) the evidence that Applicant's pattern
of marijuana use was sporadic, averaging about once a year; and (ii) the evidence that Applicant was interviewed about his marijuana use
by a Special Agent in late September 1998 and was issued an SOR in late January 1999.  Given Applicant's pattern of sporadic marijuana
use over a period of approximately 18 years, Applicant's abstinence from marijuana for less than a year (including several months when
Applicant knew the government was concerned about that drug use) is not entitled to much weight as proof of a "demonstrated intent"
within the meaning of Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 3.<A HREF="99-0019.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P>

<P>In addition, the Administrative Judge's reliance on Applicant's expressed motivation (<EM>i.e.</EM>, concern about adverse effect his marijuana use
might have on his girl friend) reflects an arbitrary and capricious analysis that does not comport with the Directive's requirement to engage
in a whole person analysis in light of all the record evidence.  As will be discussed later in this decision, the Judge erred by deciding to
ignore Applicant's statements about the legality of marijuana use.  A person who engages in a pattern of illegal activity over a period of
years and believes such conduct is not wrongful and should be legal is, as a matter of common sense, more at risk to repeat that conduct
than a person who sincerely acknowledges the wrongfulness of the conduct, or a person who believes such conduct is not wrongful but
who nevertheless consistently refrains from the conduct because it is illegal.  The record evidence shows Applicant does not believe that
marijuana use is wrongful, Applicant does not see his use of marijuana at social functions as a problem (apart from the DoD's concern,
which Applicant characterizes as merely a "policy decision"), Applicant continues to attend social functions where marijuana occasionally
is present, and Applicant has not expressed remorse or regret about his history of marijuana use.  Furthermore, the Judge failed to take into
account that Applicant's expressed reason for refraining from marijuana use reflects no concern for the illegality or security implications
of marijuana use,<A HREF="99-0019.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and is based on a purely personal concern of Applicant's that could fade or disappear with the passage of time or a
change in Applicant's personal life.</P>

<P>Given the totality of the record evidence, Applicant's history of marijuana use, Applicant's relatively brief period of abstinence from
marijuana, and Applicant's expressed motivation for refraining from marijuana use do not provide a sustainable basis for the
Administrative Judge's application of Drug Involvement Mitigating 3 in this case.</P>

<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN>.  Department Counsel also
contends the Administrative Judge's favorable security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law because the Judge
erred by ruling he would not consider Applicant's statements about the legality of marijuana.  For the reasons that follow, the Board
concludes the Judge's ruling was legally erroneous and resulted in the Judge ignoring relevant evidence, contrary to the requirements of
the Directive.</P>

<P>Applicant persuasively notes that Department Counsel is wrong in asserting that Applicant opened the line of questioning about his views
on the legality of marijuana use.  However, Department Counsel is correct in asserting that Applicant did not object to the questions when
they were asked at the hearing.  Furthermore, Department Counsel is correct in noting that the Administrative Judge asked questions of
Applicant concerning his views on the legality of marijuana use.  Given the absence of objection to the questions from Applicant at the
hearing, and the Judge's</P>

<P>questioning of Applicant about his views on the legality of marijuana use, the Judge's post-hearing ruling is somewhat unexpected. 
However, there is a rebuttable presumption of good faith and regularity by Administrative Judges.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0765
(December 1, 1998) at p. 5.  Furthermore, the Judge's ruling sets forth an explanation for his apparent change of heart on the matter. 
Although the Board concludes the Judge's explanation is legally erroneous, that explanation demonstrates the Judge gave reasons for his
apparent change of mind about the matter after he reflected on it after the hearing was over.  <EM>Compare</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0476 (July 22,
1999) at p. 3 (arbitrary and capricious for Administrative Judge to change an earlier ruling without giving an explanation for doing so). 
Accordingly, although the timing of the Judge's ruling may seem unusual, the Board concludes the Judge's explanation for the ruling
removes it from the realm of being arbitrary and capricious on it face.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge erred in several respects when he ruled that he would not consider Applicant's statements about the legality of
marijuana use.  In these proceedings, the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) are only a guide and "technical rules of evidence may be
relaxed, except as otherwise provided herein, to permit the development of a full and complete record."  Directive, Additional Procedural
Guidance, Item 19.  It is not clear from the decision whether the Judge felt he was bound by FRE 403<A HREF="99-0019.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> or whether he was citing it merely
as a guide.  Even if the Board assumes solely for purposes of deciding this appeal that the Judge was relying on FRE 403 as a guide and
not an absolute requirement, the Judge erred.  To the extent that FRE 403 is aimed at preventing miscarriages of justice due to juries being
prejudiced, confused or misled by certain kinds of evidence, it is irrelevant to these proceedings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0299
(December 11, 1997) at p. 2 (in DOHA proceedings, "there is no need to apply rules of evidence and procedures intended to protect lay
jurors from being confused or improperly influenced ").  To the extent that FRE 403 is aimed at preventing undue delay, waste of time, or
needless presentation of cumulative evidence, it was not  applicable to the questions and answers concerning Applicant's views on the
legality of marijuana use.  Accordingly, FRE 403 does not provide a sustainable basis for the Judge's ruling.</P>

<P>Furthermore, Department Counsel persuasively argues that the Administrative Judge erred by intimidating that consideration of
Applicant's views on the legality of marijuana use could "readily be converted by the unwary into a simple litmus test or measure of some
sort of political correctness."  The Judge's concern for Applicant's First Amendment rights is admirable, but legally misplaced in this case. 
The Judge's error rests on two mistakes: (a) a misreading of the case presented against Applicant by Department Counsel; and (b) a
misunderstanding of the pertinent First Amendment issues.</P>

<P>A person reading the Administrative Judge's discussion of the significance of Applicant's views on marijuana, without access to the record
below, might conclude that Department Counsel was seeking to punish Applicant for his expression of views on the legality of marijuana. 
A review of the record below does not support such a conclusion.  The SOR issued to Applicant addresses his drug-related conduct, not
his expression of views on the legality of marijuana.  Furthermore, a review of the record shows Department Counsel's case was focused
on Applicant's use of marijuana, not on his expression of views on its legality.  Contrary to the Judge's suggestion, Department Counsel
was not seeking to lure him "into [applying] a simple litmus test or measure of some sort of political correctness" based on Applicant's
views on the legality of marijuana.</P>

<P>More importantly, the Administrative Judge's discussion fails to recognize some crucial distinctions in First Amendment case law that are
pertinent to this case.  First, the courts have held that in the context of security clearance investigations and adjudications the federal
government has a greater degree of latitude in making inquiries about matters that might touch upon First Amendment concerns.  <EM>See
Clark v. Library of Congress</EM>, 750 F.2d 89, 94-95 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (inquiries into individual's political beliefs and associations may be
justified in context of security  investigation for position requiring security clearance); <EM>Clifford v. Shoultz</EM>, 413 F.2d 868, 876-77 (9th Cir.
1969)(questions about applicant's relations with Cuban Communist Party and Cuban government representatives and organizations are
relevant to security clearance determination), <EM>cert. denied sub nom Shoultz v. Laird</EM>, 396 U.S. 962 (1969).  Of course, any inquiries by the
federal government in such areas must be "no more intrusive of an applicant's privacy than is reasonably necessary for a rational judgment
to be reached with respect to security clearance."  <EM>Gayer v. Schlesinger</EM>, 490 F.2d 740, 754 (D.C. Cir. 1973).</P>

<P>Second, the courts have recognized a distinction between pure speech and conduct.  While pure speech is generally entitled to First
Amendment protection, conduct is not so protected.  <EM>See, e.g., Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Association</EM>, 436 U.S. 447, 456 (1978)(there is no
absolute First Amendment bar to regulation of conduct which "was in part initiated, evidenced, or carried out by means of language"). 
The First Amendment is not a shield from prosecution for violations of the law.  <EM>See, e.g., Welsh v. United States</EM>, 750 F.2d 1101, 1108
(1st Cir. 1985)(noncompliance with tax laws is not protected under First Amendment); <EM>United States v. Conley</EM>, 859 F.Supp. 909, 938
(W.D. Pa. 1994)("First Amendment rights are not a means of immunizing one-self from prosecution.  Convictions would be few indeed if
during or after a course of crime a defendant could absolve himself by expressing his view that his conduct should be legal."); <EM>United
States v. Brodhead</EM>, 714 F.Supp. 593, 599 (D. Mass. 1989)(disagreement with the law is not a defense to criminal prosecution for
unlawfully entering Navy facility).  The same reasoning can be applied to an applicant's opinions about the legality of the drug laws in the
context of a security investigation and adjudication.</P>

<P>In this case, Applicant's views on the legality of marijuana were relevant and material to a determination whether Applicant was at risk to
repeat his marijuana use in the future.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Sections F.3.d. (motivation of applicant) and F.3.f. (probability that circumstances or
conduct will continue or recur in future).  A security clearance adjudicator is entitled to consider whether a person who believes there is
nothing wrong with engaging in conduct that is illegal is more at risk to engage in that conduct in the future than a person who recognizes
and acknowledges the illegality of that conduct.  Nothing in the record indicates or suggests that Applicant was being targeted as
punishment for his views on the legality of marijuana use.  Furthermore, if Applicant had been concerned about such a possibility, his
lawyer could have raised appropriate objections at the hearing.  By failing to consider Applicant's statements about the legality of
marijuana, the Judge erroneous failed to consider relevant and material information, a violation of his obligations under Section F.3. of the
Directive.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>Department Counsel has met its burden of demonstrating error that warrants reversal.  Pursuant to Item 33.c. of the Directive's Additional
Procedural Guidance, the Board reverses the Administrative Judge's July 19, 1999 decision.</P>

<P>I dissent from my colleagues's analysis of this case for the following reason.  I believe that it was within the Administrative Judge's
discretion to conclude that Applicant qualified for a security clearance in spite of his drug usage.  I base my analysis on the Applicant's

drugs entirely.</P>
