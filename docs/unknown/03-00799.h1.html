<P>Applicant's falsification of his security clearance application in response to a question concerning his criminal history, and his criminal charge and conviction 
in 2001, have not been mitigated by sufficient evidence of reform and rehabilitation.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On March 25, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on April 13, 2004, in which he elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.  
Department Counsel submitted  the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on June 21, 2004, consisting of eight documents.  The 
Applicant was instructed to submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on June 29, 
2004, and he submitted a reply, a letter from his company dated July 8, 2004.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>The case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on August 1, 2004. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits, and his reply to the FORM.  The Applicant is 25 years old, and is 
unmarried.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Technician, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has been involved in 
questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has admitted all of the factual allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline.  The Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application 
(Standard Form 86) dated July 31, 2002.  Question 26 of the application asked the Applicant if in the last seven years he has been arrested for, charged with, or 
convicted of any offenses not listed in modules 21, 22, 23,24 or 25.  The Applicant answered "NO".  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 4, page 5).  This was an 
intentional false answer.  The Applicant failed to reveal that in June 2001 he was charged with (1) Sex Solicitation, and (2) Disorderly Conduct.  (<EM>See</EM> 
Government Exhibits 6 and 7).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed sworn statement to the Defense Security Service dated October 11, 2002, the Applicant denied that he solicited a female for sex on June 27, 2001.  
(<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 5). This was also false information.  The police report of the incident indicates that the Applicant admitted that he picked up the 
female with the intention of paying her for a sex act.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 7).  In Applicant's Answer to the SOR he admits the criminal conduct.  (<EM>See</EM> 
Government Exhibit 3).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">      </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant has admitted the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline.  The Applicant was detained by police on June 26, 2001, and charged with 
(1) Sex Solicitation, and (2) Disorderly Conduct.  The police report indicates that the Applicant's vehicle had stopped for a female in a high prostitute area.  The 
Applicant originally told the police that he picked the girl up to give her a ride home.  After the police explained that they had been following the Applicant for 
about thirty minutes, the Applicant admitted that he picked up the female with the intention of paying her for a sex act.  The police report further indicates that 
the female told the police that the Applicant exposed his penis to her in order to prove that he was not a police officer.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 7).  The 
Applicant was issued a citation by the police and required to appear in court.  The  Applicant pled guilty to count (1) and was sentenced to 45 days in jail, 
suspended, placed on probation for one year and fined $300.00.  Count 2 was dismissed.</P> 
 
<P>A letter from the Applicant's security manager indicates that since the Applicant has been  employed in a classified area from August 5, 2002, until his 
clearance was withdrawn on April 26, 2004, the Applicant has not had any security violations.  It goes on to say that the Applicant has further demonstrated 
reliability through his attendance, professionalism and good work ethics.  (<EM>See</EM> letter dated July 8, 2004 from Security Manager of Applicant's company). </P>

<P>Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following 
Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</P> 
 
<P>None.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in criminal conduct, alcohol abuse and dishonesty that demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has  engaged in dishonesty (Guideline E) and criminal conduct (Guideline 
J).  The evidence indicates a history of poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the 
Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case under any of the Guidelines alleged in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The evidence shows that the Applicant did not reveal his complete criminal charge and conviction in 2001 for Sex Solicitation in response to question 26 on his 
security clearance application.  He also denied the criminal conduct in his statement to the DSS.  The Applicant provides no evidence in mitigation for these 
falsifications other than to say that he was not arrested nor taken to jail, so that is why he left the information off of the form.  The Applicant <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">knew or should 
have known the importance of the application and should have answered the question correctly.  He also should have been honest in his statement to DSS.  
Consequently, the evidence shows that the Applicant has not been completely honest with the Government regarding his criminal history and in fact sought to 
conceal the truth.  None of the mitigating factors set forth in the Directive under Guideline E apply.  I find that the Applicant deliberately failed to reveal this 
information to the Government.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders.  It is a negative factor for security clearance purposes when an Applicant 
has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of his personal background.  </SPAN>The Applicant has not provided this Administrative Judge with 
sufficient evidence in mitigation that would negate the negative impact his falsifications have on his security worthiness.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, the Applicant has not 
demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet the eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against the 
Applicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's criminal conduct in 2001 shows poor judgment and unreliability.  Although, there is no evidence in the record that the Applicant has engaged 
in any criminal conduct since 2001, a period of three  years, I am not convinced that the Applicant understands the seriousness of his past conduct or that he is 
sufficiently rehabilitated.  Given the extent and seriousness of his criminal conduct sufficient rehabilitation and mitigation has not been shown.  None of the 
mitigating factors under Guidelines J apply.  Accordingly Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) is found against the Applicant.  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  </SPAN>At this time, I 
cannot find that it is clearly consistent with the national interests to grant the Applicant a security clearance.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding 
against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: Against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
