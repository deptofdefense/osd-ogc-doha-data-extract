<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 47 year-old, United States born citizen.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Her husband was born in Iran and became a naturalized United States citizen. </SPAN>The parents of Applicant's 
husband are citizens of and reside part time in Iran and part time in the United States. They are retired and have never worked for the Iranian government.  
Applicant's husband also has siblings who are citizens of and reside in Iran.  No evidence was presented as to their status regarding employment with the

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On February 18, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated </SPAN>March 12, 2003<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded in writing to the SOR allegations. She requested that her case be decided on the 
written record in lieu of a hearing. On July 2, 2003, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM)  <A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided to the Applicant, and she was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation. Applicant had until August 14, 2003, to file a response to the FORM, but no response was submitted. The case was assigned to this Administrative 
Judge on September 4, 2003.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the FORM, Department Counsel offered six documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 6)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. No exhibits were offered by Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B of the Directive because Applicant's immediate family 
members are not United States citizens and may be subject to duress. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The SOR contains two allegations, 1.a. and 1.b., under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  
In her response to the SOR, Applicant admits some of the allegations and denies some. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Specifically she admits that her parents-in-law and siblings-in-law are 
citizens of Iran. She also admits that her parents-in-law have resident alien status in the United States. The admitted allegations are incorporated as findings of 
fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">admitted</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and upon due 
consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is 47 years old. She </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">was born in the United States and has been solely a United States citizen for her entire life. Her husband, whom she married in 
1982, was born in Iran and became a naturalized United States citizen in 1981.  Applicant and her husband have two children, who were born in the United 
States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's parents-in-law </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> are citizens of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">and reside part of the time in Iran</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. They have resident alien status in the United States, and they spend part of every 
year in the United States (Exhibit 3). They are now both retired, and neither of them ever worked in any capacity for the Iranian government (Exhibit 5).  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant does not speak to her parents-in-law very often when they are in Iran, but she visits them regularly when they are in the United States, and they 
generally stay at the home of her and husband for approximately one or two months, when they come to the United States </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(Exhibit 5).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Applicant's husband also 
has siblings who are citizens of and reside in Iran.   No evidence was introduced as to their status regarding current or past employment with the government of 
Iran. There was also no information as to the frequency and nature of contacts with these siblings-in-law and Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">that must be carefully</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> considered</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 
2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>FOREIGN INFLUENCE (GUIDELINE B) </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.2. Condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.3. Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.3.1. A determination that the immediate family member(s). . . in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P><P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. Applicant's parents-in-law and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">siblings-in-law </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">are citizens of and reside in</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Iran. The Iranian citizenship and residency of members of Applicant's 
family create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable 
to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, 
extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet her burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">or continue a security 
clearance for him. ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">As Applicant's family members are citizens of Iran, a country which is undisputedly hostile to the Government of the United States, Applicant has a very heavy

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The evidence of existence of immediate family members, who are citizens of Iran, comes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.2.1, immediate family
