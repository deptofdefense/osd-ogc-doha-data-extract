<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On October 10, 2003,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR alleged facts 
under Guideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline E (personal conduct) which detail reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance, and recommended referral 
to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. </P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated November 18, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was originally 
assigned to another administrative judge on September 7, 2004, and due to caseload considerations was re-assigned to me on February 1, 2005.  Notice of the 
hearing was issued March 9, 2005.  Applicant had actual notice of the hearing date on or about March 9, 2005, and specifically waived  the 15 day written 
notice requirement.<A HREF="02-11965.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The transcript was received April 11, 2005. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has admitted to all 8 SOR allegations pertaining to financial matters under Guideline F (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.h.), and denied the two

<P>From the time he signed his security clearance application until the time of his unemployment, nearly 2 &frac12; years elapsed with no payments to creditors

<P>"[No] one has a 'right' to a security clearance."<A HREF="02-11965.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN>  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the authority to...control access to information bearing on 
national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position...that will give that person access to such 
information."<A HREF="02-11965.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN>  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history 
affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom 
from conflicting allegiances and potential coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing use, handling, and protection of classified 
information."<A HREF="02-11965.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Eligibility for a security clearance may be adjudicated using the  security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the 
applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or 
presence of rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  </P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="02-11965.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN>  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven 
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.<A HREF="02-11965.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="02-11965.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN>  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="02-11965.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has 
access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a 
compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as 
his or his own.  The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for 
access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="02-11965.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial 
security decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security 
clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the SOR allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here 
are those conditions listed under Guideline F (financial considerations) (FC), Directive,&para; E2.A6.1.1. <EM>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of 
having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts; </EM>and Guideline E 
(personal conduct) (PC), Directive, &para; E2.A5.1.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information</EM>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence,  and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline F.  As indicated above, Applicant's financial situation shows unpaid obligations that existed over a 
long period of time.  His financial statements indicate an ability to pay his debts.  But the debts listed in the SOR continue to show up on successive credit 
reports as unpaid.  He indicated he had contacted a law firm to resolve questions about the validity of these debts, but when given the opportunity to submit 
mitigating evidence, he submitted.  Failure to pay outstanding financial obligations gives rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 
E2.A6.1.2.1. (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>); and FC DC E2A6.1.2.3. (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the fact that the financial statements indicated an ability to pay debts with a surplus on hand,  Applicant has not made a good-faith effort to pay 
down his debts.  He testified about hiring a law firm to assist him in resolving these debts with various creditors but did not produce any evidence when given 
an opportunity to supplement the record.  His actions do not rise to the level necessary to satisfy  FC MC E2A6.1.3.6. (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith 
effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>).   I conclude SOR allegations 1.a. through 1.h. against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government also alleged that Applicant falsely answered  two questions on his security clearance application, by omitting that he had unpaid judgments 
and delinquent debts greater than  180 days.  The credit reports and his admissions demonstrate that he had an unpaid judgment and debts delinquent in excess 
of 180 days.  These false statements come under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. <EM> (the deliberate omission, 
concealment, or falsification of relevant material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct 
investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary 
responsibilities)</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  Applicant offered no rebuttal.  He did not supplement the record to mitigate these allegations when given the opportunity.  No mitigating 
conditions are applicable.  I conclude SOR allegations 2.a. and b. against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
