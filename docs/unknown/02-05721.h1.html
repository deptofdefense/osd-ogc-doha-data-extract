<P>The Applicant is a dual citizen of Canada and the United States.  She has made a decision not to renounce her Canadian citizenship in order to be able to obtain 
medical treatment from the Canadian government, if necessary.  She also continued to retain her Canadian passport, despite the knowledge that the Government 
required her to surrender it.  Finally, the Applicant did not show that her Canadian relatives are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be influenced 
by a foreign power.  Adverse inference is not overcome.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 23, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 17, 2003, and requested that the case be decided without a hearing.  </SPAN>The Government submitted its File 
of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on August 7, 2003.  The Applicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit any documents in 
rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation.  The Applicant received the FORM on August 22, 2003, and submitted no additional information<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  The case was received by 
the undersigned on September 23, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 49, married and has a nursing degree.  She is employed by a defense contractor as an administrative assistant, and she seeks to retain a DoD 
security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the exhibits.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has a 
status, or has engaged in conduct, which shows a preference for another country over the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was born in Canada.  She became a naturalized American citizen in 2000.  The Applicant has taken no measures to renounce her Canadian 
citizenship.  She argues in her Answer to the SOR that such conduct on her part is unnecessary stating, "Canada has to my knowledge, never used coercion and 
exploitative methods against its citizens.  As a mature 49-year-old adult I am fully capable of resisting any such pressures."  (Government Exhibit 3 at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was issued a Canadian passport in 1998, before she became an American citizen.  This passport expired on July 20, 2003.  In May 2003, the 
Applicant explained her retention of the Canadian passport after becoming an American citizen:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The reason I retain my Canadian passport is that I have had serious cancers twice.  The cost of treatment for these life-threatening illnesses is very great in the 
United States.  I am fortunate to have immigrated from a country rich enough to provide free first class medical care for all its citizens.  In the event I should 
experience a 3<SUP>rd</SUP> bout of cancer, and not be able to afford medical care in the US, I would be able to return to Canada for treatment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has been provided copies of the Memorandum from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence 
entitled "Guidance to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of the Foreign Preference Adjudicative Guideline."  (Money 
emorandum.)  One was sent to her with the SOR, another with the FORM.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has 
immediate family members who are not citizens of the United States, or may be subject to duress.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As stated above, the Applicant was born in Canada.  Since the Applicant filled out the Security Clearance Application (Government Exhibit 5), her mother has 
passed away.  Her father is a Canadian citizen.  Subparagraph 2.b. of the SOR is factually incorrect.  The Applicant has two step-brothers and one step-sister, all 
three of whom are Canadian citizens.  She states that her two brothers are independently wealthy and able to resist any possible pressure put on them.  
(Government Exhibit 3 at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline C (Foreign preference)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) The exercise of dual citizenship; (E2.A3.1.2.1)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;  (E2.A3.1.2.2)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) Accepting educational, medical, or other benefits, such as retirement or social welfare, from a foreign country.  (E2.A3.1.2.4)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B (Foreign influence)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country.  (E2.A2.1.2.1.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the mitigating conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may have foreign connections that demonstrates untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting or continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with 
evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of 
persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has immediate family members who are not 
American citizens.  In addition, the Government has also shown that the Applicant is a dual citizen of Canada and the United States, had an active Canadian 
passport at the time the SOR was issued, and showed no indication of surrendering it.         </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has not successfully mitigated the Government's case.  Turning first to Guideline C.  The Applicant remains a dual citizen of 
Canada and the United States and expresses an intent to retain that status into the future in order to be able to obtain medical benefits.  While she has the right 
to do so, her dual status makes it impossible for me to conclude that the Applicant has a clear preference for the United States.  Subparagraph 1.a. is found 
against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The passport issue is a bit more complicated.  At the time the SOR was issued and the Applicant filed an Answer, she had a valid Canadian passport.  However, 
by the time the record closed in August 2003, the passport had expired.  The Money Memorandum has been interpreted to apply to expired passports, as well as 
those that are active.  In addition, the Applicant's personal situation, sympathetic though it is, indicates that she will in all likelihood renew her Canadian 
passport.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, the expiration of the passport does not equate to surrender of the passport.  Subparagraph 1.b. and 
Paragraph 1 are found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With regards to Guideline B, the Applicant has not supplied sufficient information for me to find that her Canadian relatives are not agents of a foreign power 
or in a position to be subjected to influence by a foreign power.  Paragraph 2 and both of its subparagraphs are found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the Government's case opposing her request for a DoD security clearance.  
Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the 
Government's Statement of Reasons.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: Against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.a.: Against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
