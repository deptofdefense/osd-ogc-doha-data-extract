<P>While on active duty in the U.S. Navy, Applicant received non-judicial punishment for using provoking language and making threats toward his chief petty 
officer.  He was evaluated for anger management and alcohol abuse, diagnosed as having a personality disorder, and discharged from the Navy for misconduct.  
On his security clearance application (SF-86), he intentionally did not disclose his non-judicial punishment and mental health evaluation.  In a subsequent 
interview with a security investigator, he gave false explanations for his omissions from the SF-86 and the reasons for his discharge from the Navy.  Security

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 13, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny 
Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and J (Criminal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In an undated document, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting some allegations and denying others, and he requested a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to 
me on September 15, 2005, and heard on October 28, 2005.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 9, 2005.<A HREF="03-05162.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 34-year-old network engineer for a defense contractor.  He was born in the United Kingdom and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in March 
1990.  He served in the U.S. Navy and held a security clearance for almost nine years.<A HREF="03-05162.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He has worked for his current employer for about four years.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was married in October 1991 and had two children during that marriage.  He was divorced in January 1996.  He remarried in October 1996,<A HREF="03-05162.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and 
divorced on a date not reflected in the record.  He has remarried again, and has one child from his current marriage.<A HREF="03-05162.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 1993, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and battery after a mutual affray at a party.  Both participants had been drinking.<A HREF="03-05162.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The 
charges were dismissed after Applicant agreed to pay the victim's medical bills.<A HREF="03-05162.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In January 1998, Applicant executed a SF-86.  He answered "no" to question 23, concerning arrest, charges, or conviction of any offenses not listed elsewhere 
on the form during the last seven years, and he did not disclose his arrest for assault and battery in December 1993.<A HREF="03-05162.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  In a statement to a security investigator in 
June 1998, Applicant stated he was advised by his attorney that the record would be expunged, and he was advised by an investigator to answer "no" to 
questions about his criminal record.<A HREF="03-05162.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  He offered the same explanation at the hearing.<A HREF="03-05162.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 7, 1998, Applicant received non-judicial punishment under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. &sect; 815, for using 
provoking speech and communicating a threat to his chief petty officer at an off-duty social event, in violation of Articles 117 and 134, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 
917 and 934, respectively.  Applicant admitted his judgment was impaired by alcohol during this incident.<A HREF="03-05162.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  The incident was one of several altercations that 
occurred between Applicant and his chief petty officer.<A HREF="03-05162.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  In addition to imposing non-judicial punishment, his commander ordered him to undergo evaluation 
for anger management and alcohol abuse.<A HREF="03-05162.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  He was evaluated and diagnosed as having a personality disorder.  In February 1999, he was discharged from the 
Navy for misconduct, receiving a general discharge under honorable conditions.<A HREF="03-05162.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant attended an alcohol awareness class in 1998, and he recognized his alcohol consumption was out of control.  He has moderated his drinking and now 
consumes alcohol "on an occasional basis."<A HREF="03-05162.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In February 2002, Applicant executed another SF-86.  He answered "no" to question 19, asking about mental health consultations, and he did not disclose his 
evaluation for anger management and alcohol abuse.  He also answered "no" to question 25, asking if he had been subject to court-martial or other disciplinary 
proceedings under the UCMJ during the last seven years, and he did not disclose the non-judicial punishment imposed in December 1998. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 20, 2004, Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator and stated he received a general discharge under honorable conditions because he 
declined to sign a request for extension of service and no longer wanted to be in the Navy.  He told the investigator he did not list his non-judicial punishment 
on the SF-86 because he had forgotten about it.<A HREF="03-05162.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 29, 2004, Applicant was interviewed again by the same investigator, and he admitted he failed to disclose the non-judicial punishment and mental 
health evaluation because he feared they would adversely affect his ability to hold a clearance.  He also admitted he was discharged in lieu of administrative 
separation for misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the

national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and 
mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material 
facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para;&para; 6.3.1 through 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations 
could indicate an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several disqualifying conditions (DC) apply to this case.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">DC 1 applies when there is "[r]eliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, 
coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances."  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.1.  The information from Applicant's Navy records about his non-judicial punishment 
and discharge for misconduct establishes DC 1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 2 applies where there has been a deliberate omission or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personal security questionnaire.  Directive 
&para;E2.A5.1.2.2.  DC 3 applies when an applicant deliberately provides false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator 
or security official in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.  Directive &para;E2.A5.11.2.3. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> Applicant's admission he deliberately 
concealed his non-judicial punishment and mental health evaluation on his SF-86 establishes DC 2.  His admission he made a false statement to the security 
investigator on April 20, 2004, establishes DC 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress" may raise a disqualifying 
condition (DC 4).  Directive &para; E.A5.1.2.4.  Applicant's non-judicial punishment and command-directed evaluation for anger management and alcohol abuse, 
which he tried to conceal when he applied for a security clearance in February 2002, establish DC 4.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">A disqualifying condition (DC 5) also may be established by evidence showing a "pattern of dishonesty or rule violations."  I conclude DC 5 is established, 
because Applicant's dishonest responses on his SF-86 and false answers to a security investigator establish a pattern of dishonesty.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two mitigating conditions (MC) are relevant to this case.  MC 2 applies when the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has 
subsequently provided correct information voluntarily.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.2.  MC 3 applies when the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct 
the falsification before being confronted with the facts.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.3.  Neither condition is established here.  Applicant's falsification was recent, 
and he did not provide correct information promptly or voluntarily.  To the contrary, he persisted in the falsification in his statement of April 20, 2004, and did 
not provide correct information until he was interviewed again on April 29, 2004, and confronted with the facts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's falsifications occurred after he had served nine years in responsible Navy positions.  He had held a clearance for years and should have understood 
the importance of candor in the security clearance process.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E2.2.1.4. (age and maturity at time of conduct).  Other than testifying he has 
matured and realizes his mistakes, he produced no evidence of rehabilitation or behavioral changes with respect to these traits.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E2.2.1.6.  
Whether acts of dishonesty will recur cannot be determined on this record.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E2.2.1.9.  Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating 
condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  After weighing the 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security 
concern based on personal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under this 
guideline, a single serious offense can raise a security concern (DC 2).  A deliberately false answer on a security clearance application or in response to 
questions by a security investigator is a serious crime within the meaning of Guideline J.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than 
five years, or both, to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the 
jurisdiction of the executive branch of the government of the United States.  18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of the executive 
branch of the government of the United States.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 527.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted deliberately omitting material facts from his answers to 
questions 19 and 25 of the SF 86 executed in February 2002, and making a false statement to a security investigator.  His admissions establish serious crimes 
under DC 2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, Applicant denied falsifying his earlier SF-86 executed in January 1998 by failing to disclose his December 1993 arrest.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When a falsification 
allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant's intent 
when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial 
evidence concerning an applicant's intent at the time the omission occurred.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in 
ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).  Applicant's explanation that he omitted this information</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> on the advice of an attorney and a security 
investigator because it was expunged from his record is plausible.  Based on his demeanor and testimony at the hearing and all the other evidence, I find his 
explanation believable.  Accordingly, I conclude Applicant did not intentionally falsify his answer to question 23 when he executed his SF-86 in January 1998, 
and I resolve SOR &para; 1.e. in his favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Communicating a threat, one of the offenses for which Applicant received non-judicial punishment, carries a heavy penalty under the UCMJ.<A HREF="03-05162.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  Nevertheless, 
his command decided to treat it as a minor offense by disposing of it by non-judicial punishment instead of a court-martial.  Accordingly, I conclude it was not 
a serious crime withing the meaning of DC 2.  However, when considered along with the affray for which Applicant was arrested in 1993 and the reports of 
multiple conflicts between Applicant and his chief petty officer, there is sufficient evidence of "multiple lesser offenses" to establish DC 2.  Based on 
Applicant's total criminal history, encompassing serious as well as minor offenses, I conclude DC 2 is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal conduct can be mitigated by showing it was not recent (MC 1) or an isolated event (MC 2).  Directive &para;&para; E2.A10.1.3.1., &para; E2.A10.1.3.2. Applicant's 
arrest in December 1993 is not recent and was an isolated event.  His altercation with his chief petty officer in 1998 is not recent, but it was one of a series of 
conflicts and not an isolated event.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal conduct also can be mitigated (MC 6) by "clear evidence of successful rehabilitation."  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.3.6.  Applicant has not been involved in 
any alcohol-related affrays since the 1998 incident.  He appears to have outgrown his combative behavior and moderated his alcohol consumption.  He has 
remarried, has an infant child, and apparently has been a reliable and responsible employee for the past four years.  Based on all the evidence, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concern based on his criminal conduct while in the Navy.  Accordingly, I resolve SOR &para;&para; 2.b. and 2.c. in his favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, Applicant's falsification of his SF-86 in February 2002 and false statement to a security investigator in April 2004 were recent.  They pertained to and 
tainted the current security clearance process.  Thus, I conclude MC 1 is not established.  His falsifications were not an "isolated incident" within the meaning 
of MC 2, because they constituted a continuing course of dishonest conduct intended to undermine the integrity of the security clearance process.  MC 6 is not 
established for Applicant's falsifications, because he has not presented "clear  evidence of successful rehabilitation" regarding his lack of honesty and candor.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated the security concern based on his multiple violations of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.</SPAN></P>
