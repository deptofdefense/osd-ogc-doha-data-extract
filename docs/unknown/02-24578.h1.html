</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On August 4, 2003, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-24578.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-24578.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 
September 4, 2003</SPAN> and requested that her case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File of Relevant Material 
(FORM) on December 8, 2003.  The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 7.  By letter dated December 10, 2003, a copy of the FORM 
was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  By signed and sworn 
memorandum dated January 26, 2004, Applicant  submitted information in response to the FORM.  On February 17, 2004, the case was assigned to me for a 
decision.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains 10 allegations of disqualifying conduct.  Seven allegations relate to conduct charged under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and three 
allegations related to conduct charged under Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted five allegations and denied five 
allegations.   Her admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 38 years old, divorced, and the mother of two minor children.  She is employed  as a junior electronics technician by a government contractor.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has long-standing financial difficulties.  She has moved her household several times and has incurred debts related to unemployment.  In 1992 she 
separated from her husband and moved from state A to state B.  From 1992 to 1993, she lived with her children in State B.  She chose to be unemployed and 
was supported by her family and a family friend.  In 1993, she moved back to state A and found employment there in 1995.<A HREF="02-24578.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  In 1997, she moved to state C, 
where her parents lived.  She was unemployed from June 1997 to the fall of 1997.  She did not list this period of unemployment on her SF-86.  She was 
subsequently employed for two weeks in the fall of 1997 with a company, but did not list this employment on her SF-86.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has numerous debts dating from her several relocations and periods of unemployment.  In 2001, she purchased a house and is responsible for 
mortgage payments of approximately $1,000 per month.  She owes $8,900 to an insurance company for a judgment entered against her in 1995.  She refuses to 
pay the debt because she claims it arose when her automobile was stolen from private property.  She is responsible for additional unsatisfied debts, identified in 
the SOR, which she incurred between 1997 and 2002.  She offers no credible evidence to show that she has paid these debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her response to the FORM, Applicant submitted an unsigned refinancing plan that would consolidate a total of $178,000 in debts not identified in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed and certified a security clearance application (SF-86) in April 2000.  Question 37 on the SF-86 reads as follows: "Your Financial Record - 
Unpaid Judgments.  In the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against you that have not been paid?"  Applicant answered "no" to Question 37. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 38 on the SF-86 reads as follows: "Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 Days.  In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any 
debt(s)?"  Applicant answered 'no" to Question 38.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 39 on the SF-86 reads as follows: "Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 Days.  Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?"  Applicant 
answered "no" to Question 39.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 6 on the SF-86 requires that an applicant list all employment activities by date and type of employment.  In completing this portion of the security 
clearance application, applicants are advised to list "all full-time work, part-time work, military service, temporary military duty over 90 days, self-employment, 
other paid work, and all periods of unemployment." <A HREF="02-24578.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  In answering Question 6, Applicant failed to list that she was employed by a company for two weeks in 
the fall of 1997 and she failed to list that she was unemployed from June 1997 to the fall of 1997.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government's concern under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, is that individuals who are financially overextended and unable or unwilling to pay 
their just debts may  try to generate funds by engaging in illegal acts.  Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations, and this financial history 
suggests an inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts, conditions which raise security concerns under subparagraphs E2.A6.1.2.1. and E2.A6.1.2.3. of 
Guideline F.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  DOHA's Appeal Board has concluded that "[a] person who is unwilling to fulfill his legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of 
good judgment and reliability required of persons granted access to classified information."  ISCR Case No. 98-0810 at 4 (App. Bd. June 8, 2000).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had an unpaid judgment (&para; 1.a.), delinquent debts that had been referred for collection (&para;&para; 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f.), and a 
debt for an account that had been charged off (&para; 1.g.).  An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her response to the FORM, Applicant stated that she had paid the debts identified at &para;&para; 1.c., 1.d., and 1.f. of the SOR.  She provided no evidence of the 
payment of these debts, which were identified as unpaid in a credit report dated July 15, 2003 and submitted as Item 6 of the FORM.  In her answer to the SOR, 
Applicant denied the debt alleged at &para; 1.e. of the SOR although that debt was also listed as unpaid on the July 15, 2003 credit report.  The Government has 
established, through  the FORM and Applicant's admissions, a <EM>prima facie</EM> case that Applicant is financially overextended.  Applicant provided no persuasive 
evidence to rebut the financial concerns specified in the SOR and identified as disqualifying conditions under &para;&para; E2.A6.1.2.1. and E2.A6.1.2.3. of Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We turn to a review of the several conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant's financial delinquencies.  Applicant's acknowledged 
delinquencies involve long-standing debts which continue to be unsatisfied to this day.  Thus, neither mitigating condition E2.A.6.1.3.1. nor mitigating 
condition E2.A6.1.3.2. applies.  The record also shows that Applicant's financial difficulties were not the result of circumstances beyond her control, and thus, 
mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.3. does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has not sought counseling for her financial problems, and she submits no persuasive evidence that she has developed and implemented a practical 
plan for resolving her indebtedness.  While Applicant provided some evidence that she had contacted or attempted to contact her creditors, she failed to produce 
sufficient persuasive records to demonstrate that payment plans she proposed had actually been accepted by the creditors.  Thus, neither mitigating condition 
E2.A6.1.3.4. nor E2.A6.1.3.6. applies to the facts of Applicant's case.  Accordingly, the allegations of debt in subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., and 
1.g. of the SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E, Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant deliberately falsified her answers on her SF 86 to questions 37 (&para; 2.a.); 38 and 39 (&para; 2.b.); and 6 (&para; 2.c.).  Conduct 
involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could 
indicate that an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in SOR subparagraphs 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c., the Government has established its case.  Applicant's assertions that 
she did not intend to falsify her responses to Questions 37, 38, 39, and 6 are not credible in light of her awareness of her financial problems over a period of 
several years, and her creditors' many attempts to put her on notice of delinquent debts.  Additionally, Applicant stated that her failure to list her financial 
delinquencies was an honest mistake and that she truly believed she had been forthcoming with the truth in answering the questions on the SF-86.  Applicant's 
answers to the questions and her statements in her answer to the SOR reveal that she failed to answer Questions 37, 38, 39 and 6 completely, truthfully, and 
correctly, and this raises a security concern under &para; E2.A5.1.2.2 of Guideline E.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's concealment of information she considered embarrassing or negative could make</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> her vulnerable to coercion or blackmail.  E2.A5.1.2.4.  Her conduct raises additional concerns under &para; E2.A5.1.2.5. because it suggests a pattern of dishonesty 
or rule violation.  Applicant's reticence to reveal the truth about her conduct suggests that, under some circumstances, she may put her interests before those of 
the Government.  It is well established that embarrassment is not a mitigating condition under the Directive.  ISCR Case No. 99-0557 at 3 (App. Bd. July 10, 
2000).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating condition E2.A5.1.3.1. does not apply to the facts of this case.  The information withheld by Applicant is pertinent to a determination of her 
judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. Two other mitigating conditions under Guideline E might be applicable to the instant case.  The security concern 
raised by Applicant's disqualifying conduct could be mitigated if the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and if the Applicant subsequently 
provided the correct information voluntarily.  &para; E2.A5.1.3.2.  While Applicant supplied some of the correct information about her financial delinquencies when 
questioned by a special agent of the Defense Security Service in June 2002, her falsifications were not isolated incidents and they are recent.  Mitigating 
condition E2.A5.1.3.3. is also inapplicable, since Applicant did not make prompt good faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the 
facts.  Accordingly, the allegations in subparagraphs 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c. of the SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
