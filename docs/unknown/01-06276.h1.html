<P>While Applicant's past financial conduct and personal conduct  raised security concerns, he has mitigated these concerns.  He has an agreement to pay his back 
state taxes and has explained or resolved the majority of his other financial issues.  To his credit Applicant is highly regarded at work and now lives within his 
means.  In evaluating his failure to disclose all required adverse financial  information on his security forms, Applicant did not  intend to omit any substantial 
information as he was not aware of adverse judgments and debts, several of which were reported after he completed his 1998 security clearance application (SF 
86); he did reveal other adverse information on the form.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on September 19, 2001.  The SOR detailed 
reasons why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="01-06276.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over financial concerns (Guideline F) in paragraph 1, and personal conduct (Guideline E) in 
paragraph 2.  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on October 15, 2001, where he denied in part subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 
1.d., 1.f and subparagraphs 2.a., 2.b., 2.c., and 2.d. and attached enclosures A1 and A2.  He requested a decision be made on the record, without a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel who on January 22, 2002, prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) which included twelve items. On 
January 22, 2002, the Personnel Security Specialist forwarded the FORM to Applicant to gave him the opportunity to review the evidence and to submit 
material in response within thirty days of the day he received the letter.  He received the FORM on February 1, 2002; and his response was due on March 3, 
2002.  On February 19, 2002, he submitted his response and attached two letters of reference (Applicant's Exhibits B,C, &amp; D).  The information was reviewed 
by Department Counsel, who on March 5, 2002, indicated she had no objection to the admissibility of the evidence.  </P> 
<P>On March 13, 2002, the case was assigned to me. Applicant's Exhibits A1, A2, B, C, &amp; D were admitted into evidence. </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant, 35 years old, has worked for Employer #1 in State #1 since September1997; previously he was unemployed from June to September 1997.  Formerly 
he served in the military from March 1986 to June 1997.  He married in 1992 and separated in April 1997.  (Item 4)  In January 2001 he reported he was 
divorced.  (Item 5) </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Issues and Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant completed his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) in April 1998; and he attested to its being "true, complete, and correct to the best of my 
knowledge and belief. . . " (Item 4) While Applicant revealed no financial issues on his SF 86;  he explained in an interview in January 2001 with the Defense 
Security Service (DSS) that he was unaware of any debts or judgments and attested that he did not intentionally omit information on his security forms.  (Items 
4, 5)  He cooperated and explained his financial situation without any noted DSS confrontation.  Applicant's financial problems developed while he was in 
military service when he and his wife lived beyond their means and did not pay creditors in a timely way.  He acknowledged and explained several bad debt 
accounts on a May 1998 credit report and in January and February 2001 planned to make arrangements to satisfy these debts.  He disputed some debts, for 
example a judgement for a rental property, and claimed lack of knowledge of other accounts.  </P> 
<P>His debts include the following:</P> 
<UL> 
  <LI>1.a. A State #1 judgment from February 2001 for unpaid state taxes of $666.  In his response he claims to have spoken to the "IRS" to institute a 
payment plan of $75 per month, but provided no documentation; however, I conclude he is paying on the state debt as no IRS debt is alleged in the SOR 
or documented in the evidence.  (Items 3, 8)</LI> 
  <LI>1.b.  In October 1996 Creditor #1 filed a judgment against him of $1,700; however, the creditor (previously known as Creditor #2) advised that the debt 
was satisfied.  (Items 3, 7, 8, 9; Exhibit 1A)</LI> 
  <LI>1.c.  A credit report reported that in October 1996 Creditor #2 charged off as a bad debt a loan of #13,438; however, this debt was for a car that was 
totaled and the creditor stated that the debt was satisfied.  (Item 3, Exhibit 1B)</LI> 
  <LI>1.d.  His debt of $334 to Creditor #3 was placed for collection in February 2001; he claims to have paid the debt in 2000, but provided no 
documentation. (Items 3, 7, 8)</LI> 
  <LI>1.e.  In September 2001, he was behind in paying his debt to Creditor #4 for $1,694, as he did not pay the credit card debt for three months in July, 
August, and September 2001; but in October 2001 he stated he paid $200 to bring it current, but provided no documentation.  (Items 3, 7, 8)</LI> 
  <LI>1.f.  His debt to Creditor #5 of $200 was placed for collection in September 2001; however, he claimed to be unaware of this creditor and said he would 
research the debt, but provided no additional information at the time of his response to the FORM.  (Items 3, 7, 8)</LI>
</UL> 
<P>In January 2001 Applicant had monthly net income of approximately $3,000; expenses of approximately $1,300, and debt payments of $350 on $2,500 in debt; 
thus, he had a net monthly remainder of almost $1,000.  He stated his intent to take care of all of his debts and believed he had enough money to do that.  (Items 
5, 6, 7)</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Evaluation</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant is endorsed by a senior project manager for a Top Secret security clearance as he has handled millions of pages of classified information for the past 
four and one-half years.  This manager who has known him since September 1997 reports that Applicant has produced "virtually error-free review at a volume 
consistently higher than his peers."  This manager rates him in the top ten percent of individuals doing his category of work.  (Exhibit C)</P> 
<P>A family friend who has known him for 23 years endorsed him as a very responsible individual.  He is "a man of character, a man of extraordinary integrity and 
someone you can trust."  (Exhibit D)</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a 
consideration of the evidence as a whole, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Guideline F - Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to 
proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations; </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4. . . .there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">6.  The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  The Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Criterion F - Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns over Applicant's  financial  problems were initially raised by his (1)  history of financial problems and (3) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts with a State #1 tax debt and other creditors.  (SOR 1.a-l.e.)  The most recent debt is a State #1 judgment from February 2001 for unpaid state taxes of 
$666.  Evidently, the 1996 debts and judgement for a car have been satisfied.  He has paid one small debt and denies knowledge of another small debt.  He was 
behind for three months in 2001 on a credit card debt but brought it current in October 2001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant needs to meet mitigating provisions (MC<A HREF="01-06276.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>) to extenuate these security concerns.  While his past debts raised security concerns, he has now addressed 
the majority of them and paid them off or reached an agreement to do so.  While his explanation was not documented on the State #1 tax debt, he stated he has a 
monthly payment plan to resolve that tax debt.  While in September 2001, he was behind in paying his debt to Creditor #4 for $1,694, in October 2001 he paid 
$200 to bring it current.  The only remaining unresolved debt is a small debt for $200 which he disputes (1.f.).  While he was briefly behind in his credit card 
payments (1.e.), he made it a priority to bring the account current in October 2001.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Thus, Applicant has successfully mitigated these concerns under Mitigating Conditions (MC) 4, as there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved 
or is under control; under MC 6 he has initiated a good-faith effort to repay his tax and other debts. His late payments for three months in July, August, and 
September 2001 are not sufficient to establish security concerns over his finances as he subsequently brought the account current.  With a $1,000 cushion each 
month between expenses and income, he is financially in a position to resolve his debts completely and has stated his commitment to pay all debts.  I note 
favorably that he lives modestly, has a stable job and income, and is highly regarded at his place of employment which suggests employment security.  To his 
credit Applicant has had an outstanding record of performance with his current employer for four and one-half years.  " His manager praises Applicant for his 
"virtually error-free review at a volume consistently higher than his peers" and rates him in the top ten percent of individuals doing his category of work. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Further, Applicant lives within his means and has had no large financial issues outstanding.  After considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and 
the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f. under SOR Paragraph 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied his intent to falsify on the security form and refuted the Government's security concerns over personal conduct issues concerning his 
omissions of adverse financial information.  Significantly, Applicant did reveal other adverse information on his security form:  his military police record in 
1994.  Applicant believably asserts that he was unaware of judgments and overdue balances and did not intentionally omit information from Questions 37, 38, 
and 39 from his security form as alleged.  For example, Applicant thought the 1996 debt from the car accident was resolved and provided documentation to 
support his conclusion.  His other debts were not substantial or developed, like the State #1 tax judgment, after he completed the 1998 form.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Thus, Applicant demonstrated that he has mitigated<A HREF="01-06276.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> concerns over personal conduct.   He did freely discuss his financial situation in his DSS interview 
promptly and without any noted confrontation.  As he cooperated with the investigation and explained his finances, I am persuaded that the individual has 
subsequently provided correct information voluntarily; it was not his intent to omit any material information to deceive the government.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Further, I considered his reputation as "a man of character, a man of extraordinary integrity and someone you can trust."  Hence, after considering the Appendix 
I Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c. under SOR Paragraph 2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process 
section, I make the following formal findings:</SPAN></P>
