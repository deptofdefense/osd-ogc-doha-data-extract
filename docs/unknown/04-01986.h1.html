<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On August 3, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR alleged facts 
under Guideline E (personal conduct) which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. </P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated August 23, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR.  Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant 
material (FORM) in support of the Government's preliminary decision, a copy of which was received by Applicant on January 24, 2005.  Applicant was 
afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation by February 23, 2005.  Applicant  submitted a response 
to the FORM on March 15, 2005.  By memorandum dated April 4, 2005, Department Counsel did not object to the materials Applicant submitted.  The case 
was  assigned to me on April 7, 2005.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant has admitted to the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 1.d. and 1.i. pertaining to personal conduct under Guideline E (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i.).  
Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following 
additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a married 52-year-old employee of a federal contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance.<A HREF="04-01986.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN>  He was employed by this contractor in July 2001.<A HREF="04-01986.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  
He is a retired 20-year veteran with an 80% service connected disability rating.<A HREF="04-01986.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant had nine job terminations or resignations from July 1995 to June 
2002. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Findings of fact with respect to each SOR allegation are set out in table format as follows:  </SPAN></P>

<P>In examining Attachments A - I to Applicant's Answer, Applicant frequently points out what he believes to be deficiencies in other personnel/managers or in 
company policies.  He argues he has been discriminated against because of his disability.  What other employees may or may not have done is not a persuasive 
defense.  The facts demonstrate that Applicant did not comply with company policies of 5 of 9 employers.  He caused damage to company property by careless 
driving at 2 different employers.  In the first instance, he was patrolling a perimeter fence, received a call to return to the office, made a sharp turn causing an 
open soda can and weapons which were on the seat beside him to start sliding onto the floor.  He let go of the wheel to grab the weapons and can causing the 
car to hit three parked cars. His employer categorized it as "grossly inefficient job performance."<A HREF="04-01986.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  In the other, he hit a fence post which he did not report, and 
there were allegations of missing government property (the fence post) and some circumstantial evidence of an attempt to cover up the accident.  However, this 
is rendered moot as Applicant admitted the accident.<A HREF="04-01986.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>   </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"[No] one has a 'right' to a security clearance."<A HREF="04-01986.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN>  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the authority to...control access to information bearing on 
national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position...that will give that person access to such 
information."<A HREF="04-01986.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN>  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history 
affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom 
from conflicting allegiances and potential coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing use, handling, and protection of classified 
information."<A HREF="04-01986.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Eligibility for a security clearance may be adjudicated using the  security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the 
applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; absence or 
presence of rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  </P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="04-01986.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN>  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven 
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.<A HREF="04-01986.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="04-01986.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN>  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="04-01986.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has 
access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a 
compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as 
his or his own.  The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for 
access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="04-01986.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a degree of legally permissible calculation as to potential, rather than 
actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial 
security decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security 
clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the SOR allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here 
are those conditions listed under Guideline E (personal conduct) (PC), Directive, &para; E2.A5.1.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard 
classified information</EM>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence,  and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline E.  Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.5. <EM>A pattern of dishonesty or rule 
violations including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency</EM>). Applicant's job terminations involved 
violations of attendance policies, or reporting procedures, or in one instance, an attempt to cover up an accident.  His rebuttal evidence tended to cast fault with 
other employees or with company policies, rather than taking responsibility for his own failures to follow company policies.  What another employee may or 
may not have done does not mitigate or absolve Applicant from his responsibility to follow his employers' rules and policies.  For those allegations that I have 
concluded against Applicant, my reasons relate to his negligent conduct or failure to follow rules, and further conclude that they were not as a result of his 
disability.  Those employers had established rules that required an employee to call in if he/she was going to be late.  Working security, especially in penal 
institutions, requires that employees be on the job at the appointed time.  If an employee is habitually late to work, it creates a major staffing problem for that 
institution.   The accidents speak for themselves.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude there are no mitigating conditions that are applicable.  Applicant has a pattern of adverse personnel actions with numerous employers which raise 
concerns about his trustworthiness, unwillingness or inability to follow rules, and judgment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Because there was no substantial evidence in the record or because inability to perform a job was due to Applicant's disability, I conclude SOR allegations 1.c., 
e., f., and h. for the Applicant.  I conclude SOR allegations  1.a., b., d., g., and i. against the Applicant. </SPAN></P>
